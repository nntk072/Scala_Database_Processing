Educational reorganisation and retrenchment

Main article:
History of education in Scotland
In the 20th century, the centre of the education system became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939.
[208]
The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, but despite attempts to raise it to 15 this was only made law in 1939 and then postponed because of the outbreak of war. In 1918,
Roman Catholic
schools were brought into the state system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church.
[208]
The first half of the 20th century saw Scottish universities fall behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.

Polaris submarines at the expanded
Faslane Naval Base
on the

. The first patrol of a

Overview
[
edit
]
After World War II, Scotland's economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only began to change in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of
North Sea
oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy.
[

]
This period saw the emergence of the
Scottish National Party
and movements for both
Scottish independence
and more popularly
devolution
. A referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40 per cent of the electorate.
[
citation needed
]
However, in 1997 Scottish voters voted in favour of establishing a
Scottish Parliament
which was established in 1998 and thus
Scottish devolution
was reformed.
[304]
In 2014, the
independence referendum
saw vote against independence by 55% to 45% choosing to remain in the United Kingdom.

In the second half of the 20th century the Labour Party usually won most Scottish seats in the Westminster parliament, losing this dominance briefly to the
Unionists
in the 1950s. Support in Scotland was critical to Labour's overall electoral fortunes as without Scottish MPs it would have gained only two UK electoral victories in the 20th century (1945 and 1966).
[306]
The number of Scottish seats represented by Unionists (known as
Conservatives
from 1965 onwards) went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997.
[307]
Politicians with Scottish connections continued to play a prominent part in UK political life, with Prime Ministers including the Conservatives
Harold Macmillan
(whose father was Scottish) from 1957 to 1963 and
Alec Douglas-Home
from 1963 to 1964.
[216]
The
Scottish National Party
gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974.
[289]
However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the necessary support of 40 per cent of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal) and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s.
[289]
The introduction in 1989 by the
Thatcher
-led
Conservative
government of the
Community Charge
(widely known as the Poll Tax), one year before the rest of the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs.
[308]
The electoral success of New Labour in 1997 was led by two Prime Ministers with Scottish connections: Tony Blair (who was brought up in Scotland) from 1997 to 2007 and
Gordon Brown
from 2007 to 2010,
[216]
opened the way for constitutional change. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of
Battle of Stirling Bridge
, the
Blair
led
Labour
government again held a referendum on the issue of devolution. A positive outcome led to the establishment of a devolved
Scottish Parliament
in 1999. A
coalition
government, which would last until 2007, was formed between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with
Donald Dewar
as
First Minister
.
[309]
The new
Scottish Parliament Building
, adjacent to
Holyrood House
in Edinburgh, opened in 2004.
[310]
Although not initially reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the Scottish Parliamentary elections with their system of
mixed member proportional representation
. It became the official opposition in 1999, a minority government in 2007 and a majority government from 2011.
[311]
A
national referendum
to decide on
Scottish independence
was held on 18 September 2014. Voters were asked to answer either "Yes" or "No" to the question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"
[312]
55.3% of voters answered "No" and 44.7% answered "Yes", with a
voter turnout
of 84.5%.
[313]
In the 2015 Westminster election, the SNP won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, making them the third largest party in Westminster.

After World War II, Scotland's economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.
[315]
This only began to change in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of
North Sea
oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant
Forties oilfield
in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant
Brent oilfield
in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year.
[316]
Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries.
[317]
[318]
This included a resurgent financial services industry and the
electronics manufacturing
of
Silicon Glen
.
[319]
Religious diversity and decline
[

Main article:
Religion in Scotland
Glasgow Central Mosque
, the largest mosque in Scotland
In the 20th century existing Christian denominations were joined by other organisations, including the
Brethren
and
Pentecostal
churches. Although some denominations thrived, after World War II there was a steady overall decline in church attendance and resulting church closures for most denominations.
[197]
Talks began in the 1950s aiming at a grand merger of the main Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist bodies in Scotland. The talks were ended in 2003, when the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
rejected the proposals.
[320]
In the
2011 census
, 53.8% of the Scottish population identified as Christian (declining from 65.1% in 2001). The
Church of Scotland
is the largest religious grouping in Scotland, with 32.4% of the population. The
Roman Catholic Church
accounted for 15.9% of the population and is especially important in
West Central Scotland
and the
Highlands
. In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through
immigration
and higher birth rates among ethnic minorities, with a small number of
converts
. Those with the most adherents in the 2011 census are
Islam
(1.4%, mainly among immigrants from South Asia),
Hinduism
(0.3%),
Buddhism
(0.2%) and
Sikhism
(0.2%). Other minority faiths include the
Bahá'í Faith
and small
Neopagan
groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote
humanism
and
secularism
, included within the 43.6% who either indicated no religion or did not state a religion in the 2011 census.
[321]
Educational reforms
[
edit
]
Main article:
Scottish education
Although plans to raise the school leaving age to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area of growth in the second half of the 20th century.
[208]
New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the
Scottish Certificate of Education
Ordinary Grade
('O-Grade') and
Higher Grade
('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study.
[208]
The higher education sector expanded in the second half of the 20th century, with four institutions being given university status in the 1960s (
Dundee
,
Heriot-Watt
,
Stirling
and
Strathclyde
) and five in the 1990s (
Abertay
,
Glasgow Caledonian
,
Napier
,
Paisley
and
Robert Gordon
).
[322]
After devolution, in 1999 the new
Scottish Executive
set up an Education Department and an
Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department
.
[323]
One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of
student tuition fees
in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.
[324]
New literature
[

Main article:
Literature of Scotland
Carol Ann Duffy
the first Scottish
Poet Laureate
Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed Hugh MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including
Robert Garioch
and
Sydney Goodsir Smith
. Others demonstrated a greater interest in English language poetry, among them
Norman MacCaig
, George Bruce and
Maurice Lindsay
.
[300]
[325]
George Mackay Brown
from Orkney, and
Iain Crichton Smith
from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds.
[300]
The Glaswegian poet
Edwin Morgan
became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first
Scots Makar
(the official
national poet
), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004.
[326]
Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as
Muriel Spark
, with
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie
(1961) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes.
[300]
Successful mass-market works included the action novels of
Alistair MacLean
, and the historical fiction of
Dorothy Dunnett
.
[300]
A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included
Shena Mackay
,
Alan Spence
,
Allan Massie
and the work of
William McIlvanney
.
[300]
From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, this time led by a group of Glasgow writers associated with critic, poet and teacher
Philip Hobsbaum
and editor
Peter Kravitz
.
[300]
In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included
Irvine Welsh
's
Trainspotting
(1993), Warner's
Morvern Callar
(1995), Gray's
Poor Things
(1992) and Kelman's
How Late It Was, How Late
(1994).
[300]
Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburgh's
Ian Rankin
and his
Inspector Rebus
novels.
[300]
This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including
Carol Ann Duffy
, who was named as
Poet Laureate
in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.

History
[
edit
]
On September 8, 1954, Muhlenberg Broadcasting Company was granted a
construction permit
by the FCC.
[2]
The station began broadcasting on January 1, 1955, as the first radio station to broadcast in
Muhlenberg County, Kentucky
. The station was a 500 watt daytime-only station broadcasting at 1600
kilocycles
.
[3]
[4]
The station reallocated to its current frequency of 1050 kilocycles in August 1960.
[2]
In March 2013, the station’s owner, Starlight Broadcasting, was renamed Radio Active Media, Inc. The station’s programming was simulcast on the FM dial via WNES-FM (now
WEKV
) from that station’s 1956 inception until December 1981. In September 2014, the FM simulcast of WNES returned when the station launched a Class D low-power FM translator, W284AO, broadcasting a frequency of 104.7 megahertz with 250 watts of power.
[5]
Coverage area
[
edit
]
The station’s daytime signal covers Muhlenberg and surrounding counties, plus the
Owensboro
and
Henderson
area. Its nighttime signal coverage is greatly reduced to avoid co-frequency interference with other AM 1050 stations. W284AO's signal covers all of Muhlenberg County, along with portions of its neighboring counties.

The
Izyum-Barvenkovo offensive
(17 July 1943 - 27 July 1943) was a
Soviet
offensive operation of the
Southwestern Front
against part of German
Army Group South
during the
World War II
. The aim of the operation was to tie down German reserves during the
Battle of Kursk
and overrun the German forces located in
Donbas
. Soviet troops managed to cross the
Donets
river and seize the bridgehead, but the German counterattacks stopped the further advance.
Background
[
edit
]
The Soviet command believed that German troops on the southern section of the Eastern Front were greatly weakened. There were no tank divisions left in the
1st Panzer Army
in this sector (for example, in the
XL Panzer Corps
there were only three ordinary infantry divisions). Only one tank battalion remained in the reserve
17th Panzer Division
.
[3]
So, the South-Western Front was supposed to strike three
Guards Armies
(
1st
and
8th
in the main direction and the
3rd
in the auxiliary) and to break the German defenses. After that, the Soviet tank formations (23rd Tank Corps and
1st Guards Mechanized Corps
) were to enter the breakthrough. In the
Stalino
region they were to connect with the troops of the
Southern Front
and, thus, encircle German troops in Donbass.
[4]
Compensating for the lack of tanks, German troops relied on their fortifications created since March 1943. In addition, Soviet intelligence seriously underestimated the strength of opposed infantry divisions (especially their equipment with artillery and machine guns).
[3]
The Southwestern Front did not have a numerical superiority over the 1st Panzer Army,
[1]
but it included many experienced Guards units. Indeed, the 8th Guards Army (then 62nd Army) excelled during the
defense of Stalingrad
.
Orders of battle
[
edit
]
Two armies of the Soviet Southwestern Front (6th and 57th) were not involved in the  operation. Also,
6th Army
,
4th Panzer Army
and
Army Detachment Kempf
of German Army Group South were not involved. The 23rd Panzer Division of XXIV Panzer Corps was sent towards
Mius
river.

Action
[
edit
]
The Germans noticed Soviet preparations and on 14 July Hitler ordered the
XXIV Panzer Corps
from the reserve of Army Group South shifted back behind the 1st Panzer Army.
[9]
The Soviet offensive began on July 17. The 1st and 8th Guards Armies managed to cross the
Seversky Donets
River, capture new bridgeheads on the right bank and advance to a depth up to 5 kilometers. However, the advance stopped there, because Soviet troops were unable to crack the defense system completely and so the tank units could not operate freely in a greater depth. The German command quickly used at first the reserves of the 1st Panzer Army and then the XXIV Panzer Corps. Attacks of the 3rd Guards Army in the auxiliary direction were completely unsuccessful.
[4]
In the following days there was a fierce head-on battle. The German units launched counterattacks, trying to liquidate the Soviet bridgeheads. They did not achieve full success, but suppressed the Soviet troops and completely ruled out the possibility of an operational breakthrough.
[2]
Both sides suffered serious losses. So, the 17th Panzer Division in a few days lost 91 officers and 2,446 soldiers, Generalleutnant Walter Schilling was killed. Opposing them, the
79th Guards Rifle Division
lost 4,681 people and the division commander Batyuk died of a heart attack soon after the end of the operation.
[1]
Military historian
Ziemke
said about Izyum-Barvenkovo offensive along with the
Mius offensive
: "Those were small battles, like so many others quickly lost in the rush of greater events, but, nevertheless, enormously costly for both sides."
[9]
Results
[
edit
]
Soviet troops failed to realize the plan of the offensive, the German troops in Donbas avoid encirclement and defeat. Soviet historiography claims that the operation shackled the German reserves necessary for the Battle of Kursk.

Shorts made to look like a skirt
Golfer
Zakiya Randall
wearing a skort.
A
skort
is a pair of shorts with an overlapping fabric panel made to resemble a skirt covering the front and back, or a skirt with a pair of integral shorts hidden underneath (also can be called sport skirts).
[1]
History
[
edit
]
A field hockey player wearing a skort as part of her uniform
While some garments sold as
culottes
resemble short
trousers
, to be skorts they need to look like skirts. They are distinguished from trousers or shorts by a fuller cut at the bottom (
hem
) than at the waist.
Initially called "trouser skirts," skorts were developed to provide more freedom to do activities (such as sports, gardening, cleaning, or bike riding), and give the appearance of a skirt. At first, skorts were not deemed appropriate to be worn during any non-athletic activity.
[2]
Montgomery Ward claimed in their 1959 Spring/Summer catalog to have invented the garment they called a skort.  It was a short knife or accordion pleated skirt with an attached
bloomer
underneath.  Years later, the term was applied to a pair of shorts with a flap of fabric across the front (and often the back) making the garment appear to be a skirt.  In recent years, the term skort has been given to any skirt with an attached pair of shorts.
Predecessors
[
edit
]
The origins of skorts may be related back to earlier garments like bloomers and jupe-culottes which grew in popularity in the late 19th century and early 20th century, despite common public disapproval for women wearing pants.
[3]
In 1911, Paul Poiret produced several designs that were a combination of skirts and trousers, and they became known as jupe-culottes or as
harem pants
.
[4]
Similar to skorts, culottes involve various styles that may appear as a hybrid between pants and skirts.
[5]
Skorts are distinguished by their construction as a pair of shorts with material over it to make it appear as a skirt.
Women's sports
[
edit
]
Skorts are popular in sports such as
field hockey
,
tennis
,
golf
,
ten-pin bowling
and
camogie
, and are often part of girls' athletic uniforms.
The first noted skort-like clothing to be worn as tennis attire was done so by the Spanish player,
Lilí Álvarez
, who wore a pair of culottes which had been shaped to resemble a skirt during her Wimbledon match in 1931.
Skorts continue to be popular in sports such as tennis, golf, and field hockey, but have also gained popularity in casual and athletic wear due to brands such as Lululemon. Lululemon's "Speed Up" skort, for example, has gained a following for its comfortable, moisture-wicking fabric and built-in shorts that provide coverage and protection during athletic activities.
In addition to their practicality, skorts have also become a fashion statement, with many brands offering them in a variety of styles and designs. High-waisted skorts, skorts with ruffles or asymmetrical hems, and skorts made with patterned or textured fabrics have all become popular options.
Overall, skorts have evolved from being a practical uniform option for girls in sports to a versatile and trendy clothing item that can be worn for a variety of activities.

[1]
Early life
[
edit
]
Arbuthnot was born at

The Long Earth
is the first novel in a collaborative science fiction series by British authors
Terry Pratchett
and
Stephen Baxter
.
[1]
[2]
Plot summary
[
edit
]
The "Long Earth" is a (possibly infinite) series of parallel worlds that are similar to Earth, which can be reached by using an inexpensive device called a "Stepper" - designs for which are one day posted online suddenly allowing humanity to explore worlds "East" and "West" of "Datum Earth". The worlds are mostly familiar, though others differ in greater and greater details, but all share one similarity: on none are there, or have there ever been,
Homo sapiens
- although the same cannot be said of earlier
hominid
species, especially
Homo habilis
.
The book deals primarily with the journey of Joshua Valienté (a natural "Stepper") and Lobsang, who claims to be a
Tibetan
motorcycle repairman
reincarnated as an
artificial intelligence
. The two chart a course to learn as much as possible about the parallel worlds, travelling millions of steps away from the original Earth. They encounter evidence of other humanoid species (referred to as trolls and elves); of human settlers who learned their gifts early - including Sally Linsay, daughter of the inventor of the stepper, who joins them on their expedition; and of an extinct race of bipedal dinosaur descendants. They also encounter warning signs of a great danger, millions of worlds away from Earth, causing catastrophe as it moves. The book also deals with the effects of the explosion of available space on the people of Datum Earth and the new colonies and political movements that are spreading throughout the Long Earth.
A young girl, Helen Green, and her family (with the exception of her brother, Rod, who is unable to step) trek across the long earth to form a new community, Reboot, on Earth West 101,754.
After stepping across "The Gap" - a universe around two million steps from the Datum where the Earth no longer exists - Joshua and Lobsang encounter the threat that has caused the slow migration of Trolls away from the gap. First Person Singular is a being that absorbs other sentient life forms, eventually taking over everything on earth before stepping to the next. It currently cannot pass The Gap. Lobsang elects to stay in First Person Singular's universe and commune with it, in the hopes of convincing it not to advance further, or at least to not absorb all other sentients.
Joshua and Sally return to Datum Earth back the way they came.  Upon reaching Earth West 101,754, they hear news that Datum
Madison
has been destroyed in a nuclear explosion, the result of a bomb planted by a terrorist group of humans incapable of stepping (called "phobics" in the book's terminology).  The book ends with the two of them briefly seeing the explosion site, before retreating to Earth West 1 Madison, where a backed-up instantiation of Lobsang contacts Joshua by phone.
Characters
[
edit
]
Joshua Valienté
: an orphan, born on another world when his mother stepped during childbirth. A natural stepper. He is antisocial but has an altruistic nature.
Lobsang
: an
artificial intelligence
who claims to be a reincarnated Tibetan motorcycle repairman.
Sally Linsay
: daughter of the inventor of the Stepper box, a device that allows the majority of humans to step between parallel universes. A natural stepper and later romantic interest to Joshua Valienté. Like Joshua, she usually prefers the tranquillity of uninhabited worlds to the "noise" of Datum Earth and their close counterparts.
Monica Jansson
: A Madison Police Officer who helps the disappearing children on Step Day, the day when the blueprint for the Stepper Box is released on the internet.
Helen Green
: a young girl who sets off across the long earth with most of her family to start a new community. She keeps a diary of her travels.
Rod Green
: brother to Helen Green, a boy who cannot step and is left on Datum Earth by his family as they travel across the long earth. He later helps in the bombing of Madison where he is captured and imprisoned.
Sister Agnes
: a nun who looks after Joshua during his younger years at the orphanage.
Douglas Black
: founder of the Black Corporation, a high-profile research based weapons and technology company and manufacturer. Creator of Lobsang.
First Person Singular
: a being found on the far side of The Gap, more than two million steps from earth, that absorbs all sentient life.
Mark Twain
: an
airship
with a certain level of artificial intelligence granted by the Black Corporation and Lobsang, allowing it, and those within it, to step. The
Mark Twain
, named after the
author
who penned the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, carries Joshua and Lobsang on their journey across the long Earth.
Reception
[
edit
]
Reviewing the book in
The Guardian
, Adam Roberts found it to be "much more like a Baxter novel than a Pratchett one." It was also said to be "a charming, absorbing and somehow spacious piece of imagineering."
[3]
The book reached 13th on the
New York Times
hardback best-sellers list on 8 July 2012.
[4]
The novel won the
Goodreads
Choice Awards 2012 for Science Fiction.

Francesco II Sforza
(February 4, 1495 - November 2, 1535) was
Duke of Milan
from 1521 until his death. He was the last member of the
Sforza family
to rule Milan.
He was the second son of
Ludovico Sforza
and
Beatrice d'Este
. When Ludovico was ousted from Milan in the course of the
Italian Wars
, he brought Francesco with him to the court of the Emperor
Maximilian I
, who had married a Sforza, Francesco's cousin
Bianca Maria
. Francesco was assigned to an ecclesiastical career. His father was imprisoned in
Loches
by
Louis XII of France
, and died in 1508, but when
Charles V
re-conquered Milan from the French in 1521, Francesco was appointed its duke,
[1]
the last of the family to hold that title. His sovereignty, however, remained circumscribed by the military occupation of Milan by Spanish troops.
[2]
He returned to his state, depleted by twenty years of combat, promoting a cultural and economic recovery. Francesco fought at the
Battle of Bicocca
, on the side of the emperor, in 1522. In 1526 he switched sides, joining the
League of Cognac
, together with
Francis I of France
,
Pope Clement VII
and the
Republic of Florence
, and was besieged in the
Castello Sforzesco
.
On May 4, 1534 he married the 12-year-old niece of Charles V,
Christina of Denmark
, the daughter of
Christian II of Denmark
and
Isabella of Burgundy
. The union remained childless. His death in 1535 sparked the
Italian War of 1535
. His half-brother
Giovanni Paolo
reclaimed briefly the Duchy of Milan after his death, but died in the same year under mysterious circumstances.

The
Shafallah Center
, or
Shafallah Center for Children with Special Needs
, is a
Qatar
-based organization founded in 1999 for the welfare of people with
intellectual disabilities
, mainly
autism spectrum disorders
.
[1]
The center provides health services and special care.
[2]
Additionally, Shafallah has education centers, and signs agreements with local firms in order to help its graduates secure jobs.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
Shafallah Center was established in 1999.
[4]
Activities
[
edit
]
An annual forum focusing on global issues affecting people with disabilities is organized by the Shafallah Center. Called the
Annual Shafallah Forum
, topics of discussion at the forum include the difficulties faced by refugees and children with
autism spectrum disorders
in developing countries, and methods to alleviate these difficulties. Several world leaders have attended past editions.
[5]
Autism research is conducted at the organization's Medical Genetic Center. Shafallah has also conducted genome sequencing as a research tool on a local scale.
[6]
In October 2015, Shafallah saw its first-ever batch of students graduate. The graduation class had 189 students.
[3]
Partnerships
[
edit
]
Shafallah Center is partnered with American organization
Autism Speaks
.
[2]
In December 2014, Shafallah signed an agreement with
Qatar Airways
in order to provide preferential employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual abilities. This resulted in a minimum of 25 members of Shafallah being employed by the airline.

, is a
legendary
figure
[1]
originating in
Western Christian culture
who is said to
bring gifts during the late evening and overnight hours
on
Christmas Eve
. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of
Christmas elves
, who make the toys in his
North Pole workshop
, and with the aid of
flying reindeer
who pull his

through the air.
[2]
[3]
The modern figure of Santa is based on folklore traditions surrounding
Saint Nicholas
, the English figure of
Father Christmas
, and the
Dutch
figure of
Sinterklaas
.
Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-
bearded
man, often with
spectacles
, wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, a red hat trimmed with white fur, a black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is popularly associated with a deep, hearty
laugh
, frequently rendered in
Christmas literature
as "ho, ho, ho!" (

)
This image originated in North America during the 19th century and has been maintained and reinforced through song, radio, television, children's books, family Christmas traditions, films, and advertising.
Predecessor figures
A 13th-century depiction of St. Nicholas from
Saint Catherine's Monastery
,
Sinai
Saint Nicholas
Main article:
Saint Nicholas
Saint Nicholas was a
4th-century Greek
Christian bishop of
Myra
(now
Demre
) in the region of
Lycia
in the
Roman Empire
, today in Turkey. Nicholas was known for his generous gifts to the poor, in particular presenting the three impoverished daughters of a pious Christian with
dowries
so that they would not have to become prostitutes.
[4]
He was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to Christianity. In continental Europe (more precisely the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany), he is usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes.
In 1087, while the
Greek Christian inhabitants
of Myra were subjugated by the newly arrived Muslim
Seljuq dynasty
, and soon after their
Greek Orthodox
church had been declared to be in
schism
by the Catholic church (1054 AD), a group of merchants from the Italian city of
Bari
removed the major bones of Nicholas's skeleton from his sarcophagus in the Greek church in Myra. Over the objection of the monks of Myra the sailors took the bones of St. Nicholas to Bari, where they are now enshrined in the
Basilica di San Nicola
. Sailors from Bari collected just half of Nicholas' skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the church sarcophagus. These were later taken by Venetian sailors during the
First Crusade
and placed in
Venice
, where a church to St. Nicholas, the patron of sailors, was built on the
San Nicolò al Lido
. St. Nicholas' vandalized sarcophagus can still be seen in the
St. Nicholas Church
in Myra. This tradition was confirmed in two important scientific investigations of the relics in
Bari
and
Venice
, which revealed that the relics in the two Italian cities belong to the same skeleton. Saint Nicholas was later claimed as a
patron saint
of many diverse groups, from
archers
, sailors, and children to
pawnbrokers
.
[4]
[5]
He is also the patron saint of both
Amsterdam
and
Moscow
.
[6]
During the Middle Ages, often on the evening before his name day of 6 December, children were bestowed gifts in his honour. This date was earlier than the original day of gifts for the children, which moved in the course of the
Reformation
and its opposition to the veneration of saints in many countries on 24 and 25 December. The custom of gifting to children at Christmas was propagated by
Martin Luther
as an alternative to the previous very popular gift custom on St. Nicholas, to focus the interest of the children to Christ instead of the veneration of saints. Martin Luther first suggested the
Christkind
as the bringer of gifts. But Nicholas remained popular as gifts bearer for the people.

Main article:
Father Christmas
Father Christmas dates back as far as 16th century in
England
during the reign of
Henry VIII
, when he was pictured as a large man in green or scarlet robes lined with fur.
[9]
He typified the spirit of good cheer at
Christmas
, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine and revelry.
[9]
As England no longer kept the
feast day
of Saint Nicholas on 6 December, the Father Christmas celebration was moved to 25 December to coincide with Christmas Day.
[9]
The Victorian revival of Christmas included Father Christmas as the emblem of good cheer.
[10]
His physical appearance was variable,
[11]
with one image being
John Leech's
illustration of the "
Ghost of Christmas Present
" in

(1843), as a great genial man in a green coat lined with fur who takes Scrooge through the bustling streets of London on the current Christmas morning, sprinkling the essence of Christmas onto the happy populace.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, the character of Santa Claus competes with that of
Sinterklaas
, based on Saint Nicolas. Santa Claus is known as
de Kerstman
in Dutch ("the Christmas man") and
Père Noël
("Father Christmas") in French. For children in the Netherlands, Sinterklaas remains the predominant gift-giver in December; 36% of the Dutch only give presents on Sinterklaas evening or the day itself, 6 December,
[12]
while Christmas, 25 December, is used by another 21% to give presents. Some 26% of the Dutch population gives presents on both days.
[13]
In Belgium, presents are offered exclusively to children on 6 December, and on Christmas Day all ages may receive presents. Saint Nicolas/Sinterklaas' assistants are called "
Pieten
" (in Dutch) or "
Père Fouettard
" (in French), so they are not elves.
[14]
In Switzerland,
Père Fouettard
accompanies Père Noël in the French speaking region, while the sinister Schmutzli accompanies Samichlaus in the
Swiss German
region. Schmutzli carries a twig broom to spank the naughty children.

Germanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization
An 1886 depiction of the long-bearded Norse god
Odin
by
Georg von Rosen
Prior to Christianization, the
Germanic peoples
(including the English) celebrated a midwinter event called
Yule
(Old English
geola
or
giuli
).
[16]
With the Christianization of Germanic Europe, numerous traditions were absorbed from Yuletide celebrations into modern Christmas.
[17]
During this period, supernatural and ghostly occurrences were said
[
by whom?
]
to increase in frequency, such as the
Wild Hunt
, a ghostly procession through the sky.
[
citation needed
]
The leader of the Wild Hunt is frequently attested as the god
Odin
(Wodan), bearing (among
many names
) the names
Jólnir
, meaning "Yule figure", and
Langbarðr
, meaning "long-beard", in
Old Norse
.
[18]
Wodan's role during the Yuletide period has been theorized as having influenced concepts of St. Nicholas and Santa Claus in a variety of facets, including his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides (compare Odin's horse
Sleipnir
) or his reindeer in North American tradition.
[19]
Folklorist Margaret Baker maintains that "the appearance of Santa Claus or Father Christmas, whose day is the 25th of December, owes much to Odin, the old blue-hooded, cloaked, white-bearded Giftbringer of the north, who rode the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir, visiting his people with gifts. Odin, transformed into Father Christmas, then Santa Claus, prospered with
St Nicholas
and the
Christchild
, became a leading player on the Christmas stage."
[20]
In northern Europe, the
Yule goat
was an earlier bearer of gifts, which has to some degree become conflated with Santa Claus, for instance in the Finnish
Joulupukki
tradition.
[21]
History
Origins
Early representations of the gift-giver from Church history and folklore, especially St Nicholas, merged with the English character Father Christmas to create the mythical character known to the rest of the English-speaking world as "Santa Claus" (a phonetic derivation of "
Sinterklaas
" in
Dutch
).
In the
English
and later
British colonies of North America
, and later in the United States, British and Dutch versions of the gift-giver merged further. For example, in
Washington Irving
's
History of New York
(1809),
Sinterklaas
was Anglicized into "Santa Claus" (a name first used in the U.S. press in 1773)
[22]
but lost his bishop's apparel, and was at first pictured as a thick-bellied Dutch sailor with a pipe in a green winter coat. Irving's book was a
parody
of the Dutch culture of New York, and much of this portrait is his joking invention.
[23]
Irving's interpretation of Santa Claus was part of a broader movement to tone down the increasingly wild Christmas celebrations of the era, which included aggressive home invasions under the guise of
wassailing
, substantial premarital sex (leading to
shotgun weddings
in areas where the
Puritans
, waning in power and firmly opposed to Christmas, still held some influence) and public displays of sexual deviancy; the celebrations of the era were derided by both upper-class merchants and Christian purists.
[23]
19th century
Illustration to verse 1 of "
Old Santeclaus with Much Delight
"
1881 illustration by
Thomas Nast
who, along with
Clement Clarke Moore's
1823 poem
A Visit from St. Nicholas
, helped to create the modern image of Santa Claus
Francis Pharcellus Church
, author of the famous 1897
The Sun
editorial which, responding to a letter from eight-year old
Virginia O'Hanlon
, contains the line "
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus
"
In 1821, the book
A New-year's present, to the little ones from five to twelve
was published in New York. It contained "
Old Santeclaus with Much Delight
", an anonymous poem describing Santeclaus on a reindeer sleigh, bringing rewards to children.
[24]
Some modern ideas of Santa Claus seemingly became
canon
after the anonymous publication of the poem
A Visit From St. Nicholas
(better known today as
The Night Before Christmas
) in the
Troy, New York
,
Sentinel
on 23 December 1823;
Clement Clarke Moore
later claimed authorship, though some scholars argue that
Henry Livingston, Jr.
(who died nine years before Moore's claim) was the author.
[4]
[25]
St. Nick is described as being "chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf" with "a little round belly", that "shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly", in spite of which the "miniature sleigh" and "tiny reindeer" still indicate that he is physically diminutive. The
reindeer
were also named: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder and Blixem (Dunder and Blixem came from the old Dutch words for thunder and lightning, which were later changed to the more German sounding Donner and Blitzen).
[26]
By 1845, "Kris Kringle" was a common variant of Santa in parts of the United States.
[27]
A magazine article from 1853, describing American Christmas customs to British readers, refers to children hanging up their
stockings
on Christmas Eve for "a fabulous personage" whose name varies: in Pennsylvania he is usually called "Krishkinkle", but in New York he is "St. Nicholas" or "Santa Claus". The author
[28]
quotes Moore's poem in its entirety, saying that its descriptions apply to Krishkinkle too.
[29]
As the years passed, Santa Claus evolved into a large, heavyset person. One of the first artists to define Santa Claus's modern image was
Thomas Nast
, an American
cartoonist
of the 19th century who immortalized Santa Claus with an illustration for the 3 January 1863 issue of
Harper's Weekly
in which Santa was dressed in an
American flag
, and had a puppet with the name "
Jeff
" written on it, reflecting its Civil War context. In this drawing, Santa is also in a sleigh pulled by reindeers.
[

]
The story that Santa Claus lives at the North Pole may also have been a Nast creation. His Christmas image in the
Harper's
issue dated 29 December 1866 was a collage of engravings titled
Santa Claus and His Works
, which included the caption "Santa Claussville, N.P."
[30]
A color collection of Nast's pictures, published in 1869, had a poem also titled "Santa Claus and His Works" by
George P. Webster
, who wrote that Santa Claus's home was "near the North Pole, in the ice and snow".
[31]
The tale had become well known by the 1870s. A boy from
Colorado
writing to the children's magazine
The Nursery
in late 1874 said, "If we did not live so very far from the North Pole, I should ask Santa Claus to bring me a donkey."
[32]
The idea of a wife for Santa Claus may have been the creation of American authors, beginning in the mid-19th century. In 1889, the poet
Katharine Lee Bates
popularized
Mrs. Claus
in the poem "Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride". "Is There a Santa Claus?" is the title of an iconic editorial by
Francis Pharcellus Church
in the 21 September 1897 edition of
The New York Sun
that became the most reprinted in the U.S. and included the famous reply, "
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus
".
[33]
[34]
In Russia, Ded Moroz emerged as a Santa Claus figure around the late 19th century
[35]
where Christmas for the
Eastern Orthodox Church
is kept on 7 January.

L. Frank Baum
's
The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus
, a
children's book
, was published in 1902. Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not firmly established at the time, leaving Baum to give his "Neclaus" (Necile's Little One) a variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, and
ten
reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous, flight-like bounds. Claus's
immortality
was earned, much like his title ("Santa"), decided by a vote of those naturally immortal. This work also established Claus's motives: a happy childhood among immortals. When Ak, Master Woodsman of the World, exposes him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world, Santa strives to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children, and eventually invents toys as a principal means. Santa later appears in
The Road to Oz
as an honored guest at Ozma's birthday party, stated to be famous and beloved enough for everyone to bow even before he is announced as "The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme Highness - Santa Claus".

's illustration for the 1903 issue of
Puck
Images of Santa Claus were conveyed through
Haddon Sundblom
's depiction of him for
The Coca-Cola Company
's Christmas advertising in the 1930s.
[4]
[36]
The image spawned
urban legends
that Santa Claus was invented by The Coca-Cola Company or that Santa wears red and white because they are the colors used to promote the Coca-Cola brand.
[37]
Coca-Cola's competitor
Pepsi-Cola
used similar Santa Claus paintings in its advertisements in the 1940s and 1950s. Historically, Coca-Cola was not the first
soft drink
company to utilize the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising—
White Rock Beverages
had used a Santa figure in monochrome advertisements for
mineral water
in 1915, and in 1923-25, the same company used colour images of Santa Claus in adverts for drink mixers.
[38]
Earlier, Santa Claus had appeared dressed in red and white and essentially in his current form on several covers of
Puck
magazine in the first few years of the 20th century.
[39]
Santa Claus portrayed by
Nick Tribuzio
in 1961 (Kent Studio, Hayward, CA)
The image of Santa Claus as a benevolent character became reinforced with its association with charity and philanthropy, particularly by organizations such as the
Salvation Army
. Volunteers dressed as Santa Claus typically became part of
fundraising
drives to aid needy families at Christmas time.
In 1937,
Charles W. Howard
, who played Santa Claus in department stores and parades, established the Charles W. Howard Santa School, the oldest continuously-run such school in the world.
[40]
In some images from the early 20th century, Santa was depicted as personally making his toys by hand in a small workshop like a craftsman. Eventually, the idea emerged that he had numerous elves responsible for making the toys, but the toys were still handmade by each individual elf working in the traditional manner.
The 1956 popular song by
George Melachrino
, "Mrs. Santa Claus", and the 1963 children's book
How Mrs. Santa Claus Saved Christmas
, by
Phyllis McGinley
, helped standardize and establish the character and role of
Mrs. Claus
in the US.
[41]
Seabury Quinn
's 1948 novel
Roads
draws from historical legends to tell the story of Santa and the origins of Christmas. Other modern additions to the "story" of Santa include
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
, the 9th and lead reindeer created in 1939 by
Robert L. May
, a
Montgomery Ward
copywriter, and
immortalized in
a 1949 song
by
Gene Autry
.

Elves had been portrayed as using
assembly lines
to produce toys early in the 20th century. That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs. Claus as executives or managers.
[42]
In 1912, actor
Leedham Bantock
became the first actor to be identified as having played
Santa Claus in a film
.
Santa Claus
, which he also directed, included scenes photographed in a limited, two-tone color process and featured the use of detailed models.
[43]
Since then many feature films have featured Santa Claus as a protagonist, including
Miracle on 34th Street
,
The Santa Clause
, and
Elf
.
In the cartoon base, Santa has been voiced by several people, including
Mickey Rooney
,
Jim Cummings
,
Mel Smith
,
Ricky Tomlinson
,
Jim Belushi
, and
Alec Baldwin
.
Santa has been described as a positive male
cultural icon
:
Santa is really the only cultural icon we have who's male, does not carry a gun, and is all about peace, joy, giving, and caring for other people. That's part of the magic for me, especially in a culture where we've become so commercialized and hooked into manufactured icons. Santa is much more organic, integral, connected to the past, and therefore connected to the future.

Many television commercials,
comic strips
and other media depict this as a sort of humorous business, with
Santa's elves
acting as a sometimes mischievously disgruntled workforce, cracking jokes and pulling pranks on their boss. For instance, a
Bloom County
story from 15 December 1981 through 24 December 1981 has Santa rejecting the demands of PETCO (Professional Elves Toy-Making and Craft Organization) for higher wages, a hot tub in the locker room, and "Aggressive recruitment of a wider gender spectrum of employee" ("short broads"}, with the elves then going on strike.
President Reagan
steps in, fires all of Santa's helpers, and replaces them with out-of-work
air traffic controllers
(an obvious reference to the
1981 air traffic controllers' strike
), resulting in a riot before Santa vindictively rehires them in humiliating new positions such as his reindeer.
[45]
In the 2001
The Sopranos
episode, "
To Save Us All from Satan's Power
",
Paulie Gualtieri
says he "Used to think Santa and Mrs. Claus were running a
sweatshop
over there. The original elves were ugly, traveled with Santa to throw bad kids a beatin', and gave the good ones toys."

In Kyrgyzstan, a mountain peak was named after Santa Claus, after a Swedish company had suggested the location be a more efficient starting place for present-delivering journeys all over the world, than Lapland. In the Kyrgyz capital,
Bishkek
, a Santa Claus Festival was held on 30 December 2007, with government officials attending. 2008 was officially declared the Year of Santa Claus in the country. The events are seen as moves to boost tourism in Kyrgyzstan.

where on 27 December 2014, 18,112 Santas overtook the previous record.  Derry City, Northern Ireland had held the record since 9 September 2007, when a total of 12,965 people dressed up as Santa or Santa's helpers. Prior to that, the record was 3,921, which was set during the Santa Dash event in Liverpool City Centre in 2005.

A gathering of Santas in 2009 in Bucharest, Romania attempted to top the world record, but failed with only 3,939 Santas.

Traditions and rituals
Chimneys
The Feast of Saint Nicholas
by
Jan Steen
(c. 1665-1668)
The tradition of Santa Claus being said to enter dwellings through the chimney is shared by many European seasonal gift-givers.
[50]
In pre-Christian Norse tradition, Odin would often enter through chimneys and fire holes on the solstice.

Christmas Eve

In the United States and Canada, children may leave a glass of milk and a plate of
cookies
intended for Santa; in Britain and Australia,
sherry
or beer, and
mince pies
are left instead. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, it is common for children to leave him rice porridge with sugar and cinnamon instead. In Ireland it is popular to leave
Guinness
or milk, along with
Christmas pudding
or mince pies.
In Hungary, St. Nicolaus (Mikulás) or Father Winter (Télapó) comes on the night of 5 December and the children get their gifts the next morning. They get sweets in a bag if they were good, and a golden colored birch switch if not. On
Christmas Eve
"Little Jesus" comes and gives gifts for everyone.
[51]
In Slovenia, Saint Nicholas (Miklavž) also brings small gifts for good children on the eve of 6 December. Božiček (Christmas Man) brings gifts on the eve of 25 December, and Dedek Mraz (Grandfather Frost) brings gifts in the evening of 31 December to be opened on New Years Day.

A classic American image of Santa Claus
Appearance
Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-
bearded
man, often with
spectacles
, wearing a red outfit consisting of jacket, trousers and hat all lined with white fur, accessorized with black leather belt and boots, and carrying a bag full of gifts for children. The 1823 poem "
A Visit from St. Nicholas
" popularized this image in North America during the 19th century. Caricaturist and political cartoonist
Thomas Nast
also played a role in the creation of Santa's image.
[55]
[56]
[57]
Though most often portrayed as
white
, Santa is also depicted as
black
or of other races. His race or color is sometimes a subject of controversy.

Ho, ho, ho
"Ho ho ho" redirects here. For other uses, see
Ho ho ho (disambiguation)
.
Ho ho ho
is the way that many languages write out how Santa Claus laughs. "
Ho, ho, ho
! Merry Christmas!" It is the textual rendition of a particular type of deep-throated
laugh
or chuckle, most associated today with Santa Claus and
Father Christmas
.
The laughter of Santa Claus has long been an important attribute by which the character is identified, but it also does not appear in many non-
English
-speaking countries. The traditional 1823 Christmas poem
A Visit from St. Nicholas
relates that Santa has:
"a little round belly
That shook when he laugh'd, like a bowl full of jelly"

Santa Claus's home is traditionally said to include a residence and a workshop where he is said to create—often with the aid of elves or other supernatural beings—the gifts he is said to deliver to good children at Christmas. Some stories and legends include a village, inhabited by his helpers, surrounding his home and shop.
In North American tradition (in the
United States
and
Canada
), Santa is said to live at the North Pole, which according to
Canada Post
lies within Canadian jurisdiction in
postal code
H0H 0H0
[60]
(a reference to "ho ho ho", Santa's notable saying, although postal codes starting with H are usually reserved for the
island of Montréal
in
Québec
). On 23 December 2008,
Jason Kenney
, Canada's
minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism
, formally awarded
Canadian citizenship
status to Santa Claus. "The Government of Canada wishes Santa the very best in his Christmas Eve duties and wants to let him know that, as a Canadian citizen, he has the automatic right to re-enter Canada once his trip around the world is complete," Kenney said in an official statement.
[61]
There is also a city named
North Pole
in
Alaska
where a tourist attraction known as the "Santa Claus House" has been established. The
United States Postal Service
uses the city's

[62]
Each
Nordic country
claims Santa's residence to be within their territory. Norway claims he lives in
Drøbak
. In Denmark, he is said to live in Greenland (near
Uummannaq
). In Sweden, the town of
Mora
has a theme park named
Tomteland
. The national postal terminal in
Tomteboda
in Stockholm receives children's letters for Santa. In Finland,
Korvatunturi
has long been known as Santa's home, and two theme parks,
Santa Claus Village

are located near
Rovaniemi
. In
Belarus
, there is a home of
Ded Moroz
in
Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park

[63]
In
France
, Santa is believed to reside in 1 Chemin des Nuages, Pôle Nord (1 Alley of Clouds, North Pole). The French national postal service has operated a service that allows children to send letters to Père Noël since 1962.
[64]
In the period before Christmas, any physical letter in the country that is addressed to Santa Claus is sent to a specific location, where responses for the children’s letters are written and sent back to the children.

to
James Edgar
, as he started doing this in 1890 in his
Brockton, Massachusetts
department store.
[66]
Having a Santa actor set up to take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to 1918.
[67]
An area is often set aside for the actors portraying Santa to use for the duration of the holiday season. It usually features a chair for the actors to sit in surrounded by various holiday-themed decorations. In Canada, malls operated by
Oxford Properties
established a process by which
autistic
children could "visit Santa Claus" at the mall without having to contend with crowds.
[68]
The malls open early to allow entry only to families with autistic children, who have a private visit with the actor portraying Santa Claus. In 2012, the
Southcentre Mall
in Calgary was the first mall to offer this service.
[69]
In the
United Kingdom
, discount store
Poundland
changes the voice of its
self-service checkouts
to that of Santa Claus throughout the Christmas retail period.
[70]
There are schools offering instruction on how to act as Santa Claus. For example, children's television producer
Jonathan Meath
studied at the International School of Santa Claus and earned the degree
Master of Santa Claus
in 2006. It blossomed into a second career for him, and after appearing in parades and malls,
[71]
he appeared on the cover of the American monthly
Boston Magazine
as Santa.
[72]
There are associations with members who portray Santa; for example, Mr. Meath was a board member of the international organization called
Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas.
[73]
Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
, many Santa grottos were not operating for the 2020 Christmas season. Due to this, some companies offered
video calls
for a fee using apps such as
Zoom
where children could speak to an actor who was dressed as Santa Claus.

In 2021,
Walt Disney World
and

Letter writing
"Letters to Santa" redirects here. For the Muppet television film, see
A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa
. For the Polish film, see
Letters to Santa (film)
.
Children sometimes write letters to Santa Claus, often with a wish list of presents that they wish to receive.
[76]
[77]
Some postal services recognize this tradition, and may accept letters addressed to "Santa Claus".
[78]
Writing letters to Santa Claus has the educational benefits of promoting literacy, computer literacy, and e-mail literacy. A letter to Santa is often a child's first experience of correspondence. Written and sent with the help of a parent or teacher, children learn about the
structure of a letter, salutations, and the use of an address and postcode
.
[79]
According to the
Universal Postal Union
(UPU)'s 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, the
United States Postal Service
(USPS) has the oldest Santa letter answering effort by a national postal system. The USPS Santa letter answering effort started in 1912 out of the historic
James Farley Post Office
[80]
in New York, and since 1940 has been called "Operation Santa" to ensure that letters to Santa are adopted by charitable organizations, major corporations, local businesses and individuals in order to fulfill the wishes of children.
[78]
Those seeking a
North Pole
holiday postmark through the USPS, are told to send their letter from Santa or a holiday greeting card by 10 December to: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK 99530-9998.
[81]
In 2006, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations,
France's Postal Service
received the most letters for Santa Claus or "
Père Noël
" with 1,220,000 letters received from 126 countries.
[82]
France's Postal Service
in 2007 specially recruited someone to answer the enormous volume of mail that was coming from Russia for Santa Claus.
[78]
Other Santa letter processing information, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, include:
[78]
Countries whose national postal operators answer letters to Santa and other end-of-year holiday figures, and the number of letters received in 2006: Germany (500,000), Australia (117,000), Austria (6,000), Bulgaria (500), Canada (1,060,000), Spain (232,000), United States (no figure, as statistics are not kept centrally), Finland (750,000), France (1,220,000), Ireland (100,000), New Zealand (110,000), Portugal (255,000), Poland (3,000), Slovakia (85,000), Sweden (150,000), Switzerland (17,863), Ukraine (5,019), United Kingdom (750,000).
In 2006,
Finland's national postal operation
received letters from 150 countries (representing 90% of the letters received), France's Postal Service from 126 countries, Germany from 80 countries, and Slovakia from 20 countries.
In 2007,
Canada Post
replied to letters in 26 languages and
Deutsche Post
in 16 languages.
Some national postal operators make it possible to send in e-mail messages which are answered by physical mail. All the same, Santa still receives far more letters than e-mail through the national postal operators, proving that children still write letters. National postal operators offering the ability to use an on-line
web form
(with or without a return e-mail address) to Santa and obtain a reply include Canada Post
[83]
(on-line web request form in English and French),
France's Postal Service
(on-line web request form in French),
[84]
[85]
and
New Zealand Post
[86]
(on-line web request form in English).
[87]
In France, by 6 December 2010, a team of 60 postal elves had sent out reply cards in response to 80,000 e-mail on-line request forms and more than 500,000 physical letters.
[79]
From 2002 to 2014, Canada Post replied to approximately "one million letters or more a year, and in total answered more than 24.7 million letters";
[88]
as of 2015, it responds to more than 1.5 million letters per year, "in over 30 languages, including Braille answering them all in the language they are written".
[89]
The tradition also exists in Great Britain
[90]
and Finland.
[79]
In Latin America, letters are sometimes tied to balloons instead of being sent through the mail.
[91]
An example of a public and private cooperative venture is the opportunity for
expatriate
and local children and parents to receive postmarked mail and greeting cards from Santa during December in the Finnish Embassy in
Beijing

International Space Station
, and
Silicon Valley
-based new
multimedia
firm Dreamtime Holdings.
[108]
Currently, most local television stations in the United States and Canada rely upon outside established "Santa tracking" efforts, such as NORAD Tracks Santa.
[109]
In addition to providing holiday-themed entertainment, "Santa tracking" websites raise interest in
space technology
and
exploration
,
[110]
serve to educate children in geography
[111]
and encourage them to take an interest in science.
[112]
Many websites exist that claim to track Santa and his workshop. One particular website called
emailSanta.com
was created when a 1997
Canada Post
strike
prevented Alan Kerr's young niece and nephews from sending their letters to Santa; in a few weeks, over 1,000 emails to Santa were received, and the site had received 1,000 emails a day one year later.
[113]
[114]
Some websites, such as Santa's page on Microsoft's former

Criticism

Christmas controversy
Opposition from some Christian denominations
Santa Claus has partial Christian roots in
Saint Nicholas
, particularly in the
high church
denominations that practice the
veneration
of him, in addition to other
saints
. In light of this, the character has sometimes been the focus of controversy over the holiday and its meanings. A number of denominations of Christians have varying concerns about Santa Claus, which range from acceptance to denouncement.
[119]
[120]
Some Christians, particularly
Calvinists
such as the
Puritans
, disliked the idea of Santa Claus, as well as Christmas in general, believing that the lavish celebrations were not in accordance with their faith.
[121]
Other
nonconformist
Christians condemn the materialist focus of contemporary gift giving and see Santa Claus as the symbol of that culture.
[122]
Condemnation of Christmas was prevalent among the 17th-century English Puritans and Dutch Calvinists. The American colonies established by these groups reflected this view. Tolerance for Christmas increased after the
Restoration
, although Puritan attitudes toward the holiday remained unfavorable.
[123]
In the Dutch
New Netherland
colony, season celebrations focused on New Year's Day.
Excerpt from Josiah King's
The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas
(1686), published shortly after Christmas was reinstated as a holy day in England
Following the
Restoration
of the monarchy and with Puritans out of power in England,
[124]
the ban on Christmas was satirized in works such as Josiah King's
The Examination and Tryal of Old
Father Christmas
; Together with his Clearing by the Jury
(1686).
[125]
Reverend Paul Nedergaard, a clergyman in
Copenhagen, Denmark
, attracted controversy in 1958 when he declared Santa to be a "heathen goblin" ("en hedensk trold" in
Danish
) after Santa's image was used on the annual Christmas stamp ("julemærke") for a Danish children's welfare organization.
[126]
Mary Baker Eddy
, the founder of the
Christian Science
movement, wrote: "the children should not be taught that Santa Claus has aught to do with this [Christmas] pastime. A deceit or falsehood is never wise. Too much cannot be done towards guarding and guiding well the germinating and inclining thought of childhood. To mould aright the first impressions of innocence, aids in perpetuating purity and in unfolding the immortal model, man in His image and likeness."
[127]
Opposition under state atheism
Under the
Marxist-Leninist
doctrine of
state atheism
in the Soviet Union after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet
antireligious campaign
.
[128]
[129]
The
League of Militant Atheists
encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being Santa Claus and the
Christmas tree
, as well as other Christian holidays including
Easter
; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.
[130]
[131]
In December 2018, the city management office of
Langfang
in
Hebei province
released a statement stating that people caught selling Christmas trees, wreaths, stockings or Santa Claus figures in the city would be punished.
[132]
Symbol of commercialism
In his 2005 book
Nicholas: The Epic Journey from Saint to Santa Claus
, writer Jeremy Seal describes how the commercialization of the Santa Claus figure began in the 19th century. "In the 1820s he began to acquire the recognizable trappings: reindeer,
sleigh
, bells," said Seal in an interview.
[133]
"They are simply the actual bearings in the world from which he emerged. At that time, sleighs were how you got about
Manhattan
."
Writing in
Mothering
, writer Carol Jean-Swanson makes similar points, noting that the original figure of St. Nicholas gave only to those who were needy and that today Santa Claus seems to be more about
conspicuous consumption
:
Our jolly old Saint Nicholas reflects our culture to a T, for he is fanciful, exuberant, bountiful, over-weight, and highly commercial. He also mirrors some of our highest ideals: childhood purity and innocence, selfless giving, unfaltering love, justice, and mercy. (What child has ever received a coal for Christmas?) The problem is that, in the process, he has become burdened with some of society's greatest challenges: materialism, corporate greed, and domination by the media. Here, Santa carries more in his baggage than toys alone!
[134]
In the Czech Republic, a group of advertising professionals started a website against Santa Claus, a relatively recent phenomenon in that country.
[135]
"Czech Christmases are intimate and magical. All that Santa stuff seems to me like cheap show business," said David König of the Creative Copywriters Club, pointing out that it is primarily an American and British tradition. "I'm not against Santa himself. I'm against Santa in my country only." In the Czech tradition, presents are delivered by
Ježíšek
, which translates as
Baby Jesus
.
In the United Kingdom,
Father Christmas
was historically depicted wearing a green cloak.
[

As Father Christmas has been increasingly merged into the image of Santa Claus, that has been changed to the more commonly known red suit.
[136]
Santa had been portrayed in a red suit in the 19th century by
Thomas Nast
among others.
[137]
A law in the U.S. state of
Ohio
prohibits the usage of Santa Claus or his image to sell alcoholic beverages. The law came to attention when the beer brand
Bud Light
attempted to use its mascot
Spuds MacKenzie
in a Santa Claus outfit during a December 1987 ad campaign; Bud Light was forced to stop using the imagery.
[138]
Controversy about deceiving children
See also:
Paternalistic deception
Parent-initiated activities, like visiting a Santa actor at a shopping center, promote belief in Santa Claus by young children.
[139]
Psychologists generally differentiate between telling fictional stories that feature Santa Claus and actively deceiving a child into believing that Santa Claus is real.
Imaginative play
, in which children know that Santa Claus is only a character in a story, but pretend that he is real, just like they pretend that superheroes or other fictional characters are real, is valuable. Actively deceiving a child into believing in Santa Claus's real-world existence, sometimes even to the extent of fabricating false evidence to convince them despite their growing natural doubts, does not result in imaginative play and can promote
credulity
in the face of strong evidence against Santa Claus's existence.
[140]
[141]
Children will eventually know that their parents deceived them.
[142]
Various psychologists and researchers have wrestled with the ways that young children are convinced of the existence of Santa Claus, and have wondered whether children's abilities to critically weigh real-world evidence may be undermined by their belief in this or other imaginary figures. For example,
University of Texas
psychology professor Jacqueline Woolley helped conduct a study that found, to the contrary, that children seemed competent in their use of logic, evidence, and comparative reasoning even though they might conclude that Santa Claus or other fanciful creatures were real:
The adults they count on to provide reliable information about the world introduce them to Santa. Then his existence is affirmed by friends, books, TV and movies. It is also validated by hard evidence: the half-eaten cookies and empty milk glasses by the tree on Christmas morning. In other words, children do a great job of scientifically evaluating Santa. And adults do a great job of duping them.
[143]
—
Jacqueline Woolley
Woolley posited that it is perhaps "kinship with the adult world" that causes children not to be angry that they were lied to for so long.
[143]
Austin Cline argued the problem is not with length, but with a complicated series of very large lies.
[144]
Typical objections to presenting Santa Claus as a literally real person, rather than a story, include:
that
lying
is
normally bad
,
[141]
that parents intentionally lying to their children promotes distrust,
[141]
that it promotes
selfishness
,
greed
, and
materialism
,
[145]
that it associates good behavior with being materially rewarded with presents from Santa Claus,
[145]
and
that tricking children into believing falsehoods interferes with the development of
critical thinking
.
[144]
[140]
With no greater good than having some fun, some have charged that the deception is more about the parents, their short-term happiness in seeing children excited about Santa Claus, and their nostalgic willingness to prolong the age of
magical thinking
, than it is about the children.
[141]
Philosopher
David Kyle Johnson
wrote, "It's a lie, it degrades your parental trustworthiness, it encourages credulity, it does not encourage imagination, and it's equivalent to bribing your kids for good behavior."
[146]
Others see little harm in the belief in Santa Claus. Psychologist Tamar Murachver said that because it is a cultural, not parental, lie, it does not usually undermine parental trust.
[147]
The
New Zealand Skeptics
also see no harm in parents telling their children that Santa is real. Spokesperson
Vicki Hyde
said, "It would be a hard-hearted parent indeed who frowned upon the innocent joys of our children's cultural heritage. We save our bah humbugs for the things that exploit the vulnerable."
[147]
Most children do not remain angry or embarrassed about the deception for very long. John Condry of
Cornell University
interviewed more than 500 children for a study of the issue and found that not a single child was angry at their parents for telling them Santa Claus was real. According to Dr. Condry, "The most common response to finding out the truth was that they felt older and more mature. They now knew something that the younger kids did not".
[148]
In other studies, a small fraction of children felt betrayed by their parents, but disappointment was a more common response.
[141]
Some children have reacted strongly, including rejecting the family's
religious beliefs
on the grounds that if the parents lied about the existence of Santa Claus, then they might lie about the
existence of God
as well.
[141]
Age-appropriate behavior
Babies and toddlers do not understand the concept of a fictional character, but most children become developmentally able to "believe in" Santa Claus around age three or four.
[149]
[139]
The prevalence of belief in Santa Claus is high at age five, and declines precipitously when children are seven or eight years old.
[150]
[151]
[152]
[153]
Although the age at disillusionment has been fairly stable for decades - in 1978, 85% of American five year olds believed that Santa was real, but only 25% of eight year olds still did - it may be getting slightly lower over time.

Mexican activist (1900-1971)
Adela Velarde Pérez
Adela Velarde Pérez
(
Ciudad Juárez
,
[1]
8 September
de
1900
[2]
-
United States of America
,
4 September
of
1971
) was a
Mexican
activist
who fought in the
Mexican Revolution
.
The daughter of a rich inhabitant of
Ciudad Juárez
, she realised at a young age that her calling was medicine. In
1915
, she joined the
Mexican Association of the White Cross
. She was the creator of the revolutionary group of the
soldaderas
, women who healed soldiers wounded in combat, with some of these even taking up arms and fighting.
Even so, Adela Velarde, the "Adelita", was not recognized for her value in combat and after the
Mexican Revolution
, she was forgotten. It was only in 1962 that she was finally recognized as a veteran of the Revolution and for her opposition to the government of
Victoriano Huerta
. She died in abject poverty in the
United States
, in
1971
.
However, now Adela Velarde Pérez is recognized as the woman whose name represents all the nurses who provided their services not only to care for the sick and wounded during the Mexican Revolution, but also to carry weapons, take care of food and even participate in battles if required.
The composer Antonio del Río dedicated "No me importa" (I don't care) to her, explaining "Several songs like
La Charrita
, and according to some versions, the song
La Adelita
,
are dedicated to her."

In
magnetic resonance imaging
, the
flip angle
, also called the
nutation
angle, pulse angle, tip angle, or excitation angle, refers to the angle that the
magnetization
vector is tipped or rotated away from the z-axis by a
radiofrequency
pulse, relative to the main
magnetic field
. The flip angle is generally measured in
degrees
or
radians
; for example, a 90-degree flip angle will deflect all longitudinal magnetization into the transverse, or xy plane. Changing the amplitude or duration of the pulse will change the flip angle.
[1]
The
Ernst angle
, named for
Richard R. Ernst
who described it, refers to the flip angle that will produce the maximal intensity of a signal for a given T1 relaxation time and repetition time.

edit
]
Rosamorada takes its name from the existence of a leafy tree of purple flowers called "clavellina" once found in the center of the town.
[1]
Economy
[
edit
]
The economy is primarily agricultural with the main crops being beans, chile, rice, melons, and watermelon.  There is also significant fishing and shrimp raising in the lagoons adjacent to the Pacific Ocean.
Geography
[
edit
]
The western part of the municipality is composed of mangrove swamps with several large freshwater lagoons formed by the Bejuco, San Juan and San Pedro rivers, the latter being the southern boundary with the municipalities of
El Nayar
,
Ruíz
, and
Tuxpan
.  The eastern part of the municipality consists of foothills gradually climbing to the
Sierra Madre Occidental
.

It is a public park operated by the City of Muskogee.
[2]
In 1909, the City of Muskogee purchased the original 40 acres (160,000 m
2
) of Honor Heights Park for $4,500. Agency Hill was officially named Honor Heights Park in 1919 in honor of the soldiers of
World War I
.
Honor Heights Park is known for its
azaleas
and hosts the annual Azalea Festival each April.
[1]
It features Symphony in the Park in June.
[1]
It also includes the Conard
Rose
Garden, the C. Clay Harrell Arboretum, Art Johnson Memorial
Dogwood
Collection, Elbert L. Little, Jr. Native Tree Collection, floral gardens, the white garden, and the
Rainbow Division Memorial Amphitheater
.
[2]
It also features three trails: the
Henry Bresser Nature Trail
, the Audubon Trail, and the half-mile Stem Beach Trail, as well as picnic areas, two picnic shelters, a pavilion, a gift shop,
gazebos
, and public restrooms.
[2]
The park is home to sports areas such as fishing in 5 lakes and ponds from the shore or fully-accessible fishing docks, a playground and splash pad, open play areas, and three tennis courts.
[2]
The Papilion Butterfly House is open daily Mother's Day Weekend through the end of September.
[2]
In November and December, the park becomes the Garden of Lights when the azaleas, with trees and other shrubbery, are covered with over 1.2 million shimmering lights.
[3]
In addition to its gardens, the
Five Civilized Tribes Museum
within the park is dedicated to the art and history of the
Cherokee

Reverse telnet
is a specialized application of
telnet
, where the server side of the connection reads and writes data to a
computer terminal
line (
RS-232
serial port
), rather than providing a command shell to the host device.  Typically, reverse telnet is implemented on an embedded device (e.g. terminal/console server), which has an Ethernet network interface and serial port(s).  Through the use of reverse telnet on such a device, IP-networked users can use telnet to access serially-connected devices.
In the past, reverse telnet was typically used to connect to
modems
or other external asynchronous devices. Today, reverse telnet is used mostly for connecting to the console port of a router, a switch or other device.
Example
[
edit
]
On the client, the command line for initiating a "reverse telnet" connection might look like this:
telnet 172.16.1.254 2002
(The syntax in the above example would be valid for the command-line telnet client packaged with many operating systems, including most
Unix
operating systems, or available as an option or add-on.)
In this example, 172.16.1.254 is the
IP address
of the console device, and 2002 is the
TCP port
associated with a terminal line on the server.

Mahis
(
Arabic
:
ماحص
,
romanized
:
Māḥis
, alternatively spelled
Mahas
) is a town in the
Balqa Governorate
northwest from the governorate's capital
Salt
, and 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) west of
Amman
. Its population was 17,754 in 2015. Most of the population of Mahis descends from the Abbadi tribe.
[2]
(
Arabic
:
العبادي
). The mountainous town is located at over 800 meters (2,600 ft),
[3]
with views on the
Jordan Valley
,
West Bank
with
Jerusalem
's walls visible on the horizon. Mahis is known for its orchards and its numerous water fountains and springs, notably the Fountain of Mahis.
History
[
edit
]
Mahis is believed to emerged during the
Roman
period, when it bordered Jewish
Perea
and the territory of
Philadelphia
- Amman of the
Decapolis
, and in the
Byzantine
period between the territory of the dioceses of
Gadara
and Philadelphia.
[4]
The name comes from the Arabic word (
Arabic
:
محص
) meaning to check out and examine due to its status as a border check point.
In 1838  Mahis was noted located  south  of
Al-Salt
, and as being in ruins.
[5]
The village was listed in the 1915 Ottoman census for the district of Salt as Mahis and the tribe of Jabara and had a population of 505.
[6]
The Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,154 inhabitants in Mahis.
[7]
By the early 1980s, the town became a practical suburb of the capital Amman.
[8]
Religious importance
[
edit
]
In Mahis there is a shrine of
Khidr
, a single room surrounded by a small garden with a green flag on top.
[9]
[10]
Near Mahies (2 km West of Mahis) in an area called
Wadi Shuaib
, is the grave of prophet
Shuaib
, or
Jethro
in the biblical tradition.
[11]
Economy
[
edit
]
Mahis is based on an agrarian economy, including wheat, barley, and tobacco as well as pomegranates, grapes and olives.  The importance of agriculture is decreasing, though figs and olives are still a primary source of income. The area also produces natural goods such as
kaolin
which is then produced in the neighboring city
Fuhais
.
[12]
The southern part of the Mahis territory called Almeda also attracts tourism due to its forested mountains and location near the
Dead Sea
/West Bank as well as Amman.  Mahis also focuses on education and is well known for its higher education academic disciplines.
Demographics
[
edit
]
In the 2015 Jordanian census Mahis had 3,284 households for a total population of 17,754, of whom 47.6% were females and 52.4% were males.
[1]
The inhabitants largely descend from the Jabara (Jubarah) section of the Abbad tribal confederation.

Major river in China
This article is about the river in west-central China. For other smaller Chinese rivers, see
Wei River (disambiguation)
.
The drainage basin of the modern Wei.
The
Wei River
(
Chinese
:
渭
河
;
pinyin
:
Wèi Hé
;
Wade-Giles
:
Wei Ho
) is a major
river
in west-central China's
Gansu
and
Shaanxi
provinces. It is the largest tributary of the
Yellow River
and very important in the early development of
Chinese civilization
.
[1]
The source of the Wei River is close to
Weiyuan County
-
Wei yuan
meaning "Wei's source" - in
Gansu province
, less than 200 kilometres (120 mi) from the Yellow River at
Lanzhou
. However, due to the sharp turn north the Yellow River takes in
Lanzhou
, the Wei and the Yellow River do not meet for more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) further along the Yellow River's course. In a direct line, the Wei's source lies 700 kilometres (430 mi) west of the main city along its course,
Xi'an
in
Shaanxi province
. The length of the river is 818 kilometres (508 mi) and the area drained covers 135,000 square kilometres (52,000 sq mi).
The Wei River's tributaries include the
Luo River
,
Jing River
,
Niutou River
,
Feng River
and the
Chishui River
.
The Wei River valley has a continental climate, with hot summers and cool, dry winters. It sits between the arid steppes and deserts to the north and the forests of the Qingling mountains. Its natural vegetation would be a steppe-forest, but it has been transformed by human activity and is mostly agricultural.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Population concentration during the
Western Zhou dynasty
(1050-771 BC). Note the extension up the Wei valley.
In
Chinese mythology
, the giant
Kua Fu
drained the
Yellow River
and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun.
[3]
The valley of the Wei was one of the early cradles of Chinese civilization, along which the
capitals
of the
Zhou
,
Qin
,
Han
, and
Tang dynasties
were situated. The area of
Dingxi
around its headwaters in Gansu has numerous Stone Age sites from various early cultures. The Wei Valley is likely the earliest center of Chinese civilization, and also the location of China's first major irrigation works.
[4]
Some Chinese historians now believe the Wei is the ancient
Jiang River
that gave its name to the families of
Shennong
and the
Yan emperor
, two Chinese legendary heroes credited with the early development of agriculture there.
[5]
As "China's natural gateway" to the west,
[6]
the headwaters of the Wei River are also notable in the development of the
Northern Silk Road
. The Chinese segment of the Northern Silk Road connected
Chang'an
(then the
capital of China
) to the west via
Baoji
,
Tianshui
at the Wei's headwaters,
Lanzhou
,
Dunhuang
, and the
Wushao Ling Mountain
, before looping north of the
Taklamakan
on its way to
Kashgar
and the routes into
Parthia
.
[7]
The Wei River Bridge (Weihe Qiao 渭河桥) featured in the design of the
5000-yuan note of the first series
of the
renminbi
, dated 1953, and shows a train passing over the bridge.
[
better source needed
]
Construction of the
Sanmenxia Dam
in 1960 caused extensive sedimentation problems in the lower reaches of the Wei river.
[8]
The construction of the Baojixia diversion works in 1972 and the creation of the Baojixia Irrigation District, with 128,000 hectares (490 sq mi) of cropland under irrigation have resulted in reduced flows.
[9]
[10]
In September 2003 extensive rainfall led to flooding that caused over 30 fatalities, and temporarily displaced over 300,000 people.
[11]
Ecological aspects of the Wei River have been examined with respect to flow rates in the Wei River.

Rock
outcrop
in
Jeti-Ögüz District
The
geology of
Kyrgyzstan
began to form during the
Proterozoic
. The country has experienced long-running uplift events, forming the
Tian Shan
mountains and large, sediment filled basins.
[1]
Geologic History, Stratigraphy and Tectonics
[
edit
]
The Precambrian tectonic evolution of the region is poorly understood. Geologists infer that the Northern Turkestan domain likely formed along the margin of the
Proterozoic
Baltica-Siberia continent. The Tarim Block may have belonged to
Gondwanaland
, based on paleontological evidence. Although paleomagnetic data for the Tien Shan mountains is lacking, some have suggested that the ocean closed to form the Turkestan domain may have been a branch of the proto-Pacific Ocean. The
Paleozoic
rocks in the Tien Shan mountains are the remnants of accreted island arcs, mainly from the
Ordovician
onward.
During the
Vendian
, the Northern Turkestan domain was part of the Kipchak island arc system between the East European and Siberian continent, separated by the Terksey back-arc basin which had originated as a rift basin. The Tien Shan mountains began to form in the Ordovician out of three island arcs amalgamated by the subduction of Terksey oceanic crust beneath the Kungey Arc, Sandalash Arc and subduction of Paleotethys Ocean crust under the Yagnob Arc. The Kyrgyz Block formed in the middle Ordovician with closure of the Terksey Basin and then underwent deformation. Coarse
molasse
sediments lie unconformably on top of subduction-related granite intrusions and volcanic rocks. North and south of the Terksey Suture, formed during the event, late Ordovician collision-related granites.
Into the
Silurian
, the Sandalash magmatic arc remained along the southern margin of the Kyrgyz Block. Turkestan oceanic crust was subducated beneath the Sandalash magmatic arc. By the early
Devonian
, magmatic activity was taking place in the northern Tien Shan mountains, likely as a result of the subducting Turkestan crust. Sedimentation occurred in shallow seas and on the passive margin of the Tarim-Alay Block.
Magmatic activity resumed in the
Carboniferous
, with spreading in the Turkestan Ocean and renewed subduction under the Kyrgyz Block. By the late Carboniferous, collision between the Tarim-Alay microcontinent and the Kyrgyz Block was underway, emplacing large
nappe
features with
ophiolite
deposits on top of the Tarim-Alay basement rocks. Magmatism continued through the
Permian
in the Tien Shan mountains, accompanied by deformation and the deposition of
molasse
sediments in different basins.
[2]
Structural geologists distinguish a number of tectonic features from the Paleozoic including the Nikolaev's Line, Talas-Fergana Fault, Turkestan Suture and Terskey Suture.
Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present)
[
edit
]
At the start of the
Mesozoic
, depressions began to develop in the
Triassic
, accumulating thick, coal-bearing sediments. The East Fergana pull-apart basin aligned along the Talas-Fergana Fault. The western edge of the basin has delta sediments while the center of the basin reflects deep water sediments. Material and fossils continued to accumulate into the Jurassic as the units were folded.
A shallow water basin covered the region in the
Cretaceous
, leaving behind salt water fauna west of the Talas-Fergana fault. Alluvial deposits mark the edges of the saline lake and Cretaceous deposits accumulated up to 500 meters thick. The lake became a shallow intracontinental sea, lasting into the
Cenozoic
. Lagoon deposits accumulated through the
Eocene
, until the sea began to retreat in late
Paleogene
times. The retreat was brought on with the collision of India with Asia around 50 million years ago. Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary rocks are up to two kilometers thick in the Fergana Basin. The
Oligocene
, the entire region had shifted to lagoon and continental deposition.
To the east of the Fergana Range, there are no Cretaceous or
Paleocene
sediments. Continental sediments accumulated there beginning in the Eocene, formed clay, siltstone and sandstone, interbedded with thinner layers of gypsum, marl, conglomerate and limestone in river valleys formed in the central Tien Shan Mountains in the Oligocene and
Miocene
. These deposits range widely from several meters thick to several kilometers. They reach their greatest thickness of four kilometers in Fergana, Atbashi and Naryn basins. Tien Shan mountain rocks show no signs of folding from the Cretaceous through the Paleogene and lie with an angular unconformity atop basement rocks.
Tectonic activity rapidly resumed in the late
Pliocene
, leading to erosion of continental sediments into intermontane basins into the
Quaternary
. Folding developed into the
Quaternary
in the Tien Shan mountains as global changes in climate brought on the
Pleistocene
ice ages. Most ridges in the mountain range are asymmetric anticlines bounded by reverse and thrust faults. Folding and thrusting is often oriented toward major basins like the Fergana, Chur or Tarim basins.
[3]
Seismic activity
[
edit
]
Due to tectonic activity since the Pliocene, Kyrgyzstan has intense seismic activity on a regular basis. There have been more than 11 earthquakes magnitude 6 or greater on the
Richter scale
since 1865. The most activity centers on the Kyrgyz Ranges, Kungey Ranges and East Fergana region.
Natural resource geology
[
edit
]
Kyrgyzstan is notable for significant deposits of antimony and mercury, such as the Chauvay, Kadamzhai and Khaydarkan deposits. These are examples of quartz-fluorite-antimonite-cinnabar (also known as
jasperoid
type deposits), while others are quartz-dickite-cinnabar or magnesian-carbonate-cinnabar (or listvenite)_ types. The primary types of deposits are common at the contact between Carboniferous limestone and overlying Silurian shales and Devonian sandstone
nappe
formations. Listvenite deposits are typically associated with
serpentine
mélange. Contact metamorphism skarn deposit gold, hydrothermal gold,
pegmatite
hosted tin, cassiterite-quartz and iron ore in Proterozoic slates are also common together, with smaller amounts of zinc, aluminum, lead, vanadium and uranium.
Oil and gas are found in commercial quantities in the Fergana Basin in Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary rocks. The oil is low in sulfur and the natural gas is dry with up to 72 percent methane. The South Fergana Basin, the Uzgen Basin, Kavak Basin and Southern Issyk Kul Basin all host coal deposits from the Triassic and Jurassic formed under continental conditions, with 70 percent hard coal.

) is the
capital city
of the
West African
country of
Liberia
. Founded in 1822, it is located on
Cape Mesurado
on the
Atlantic coast
and as of the 2008 census had 1,010,970 residents, home to 29% of Liberia’s total population.
[4]
As the nation's
primate city
, Monrovia is the country's economic, financial and cultural center; its economy is primarily centered on its harbor and its role as the seat of Liberian government.
Etymology
[
edit
]
Monrovia is named in honor of
U.S. President
James Monroe
, a prominent supporter of the colonization of Liberia and the
American Colonization Society
. Along with
Washington, D.C.
, it is one of two world
capitals
to be named after a U.S. President.
History
[

Timeline of Monrovia
Monrovia in the 19th century.
Before 1816, the area around
Cape Mesurado
and the mouth of the
Mesurado River
was called Ducor. It had long been established as a crossroads and place of trade, and was inhabited by fishing, trading and farming communities of various ethnicities, including the
Dey
,
Kru
, Bassa, Gola, and Vai. The French cartographer and slave trader
Chevalier des Marchais
visited Ducor and the Cape in 1723, conducted business there and later published a map of the area.
In 1816, with the aim of establishing a self-sufficient colony for emancipated American slaves, something that had already been accomplished in
Freetown
, the first group of
African American
settlers arrived in West Africa from the United States under the auspices of the
American Colonization Society
and with the support of the U.S. government.
[5]
They landed at
Sherbro Island
in what today is
Sierra Leone
.
On January 7, 1822, a ship took these settlers to Dazoe Island (now called Providence Island) at the mouth of the Mesurado River. They subsequently went ashore at
Cape Mesurado
, and established a settlement they called
Christopolis
.
[6]
[7]
In 1824, the city was renamed
Monrovia
after
James Monroe
, president of the United States at the time. Monroe was a prominent supporter of developing the city as a place to relocate formerly enslaved Black people from the
United States of America
and
Caribbean islands
, as an alternative to
abolishing the institution of slavery in America
.
In 1845, there was a constitutional convention in Monrovia, at which the document was drafted that would be adopted two years later as the constitution of the newly independent and sovereign
Republic of Liberia
.
[8]
At the beginning of the 20th century, 2,500 of Monrovia’s 4,000 residents were
Americo-Liberian
. Monrovia was divided into two sectors: Monrovia proper, and Krutown. Monrovia proper was where the city's Americo-Liberian population resided; the architectural style of its buildings was reminiscent of that of the
southern United States
. Krutown was inhabited mainly by ethnic
Krus
, but also by
Bassas
,
Grebos
and members of other ethnic groups.
[9]
By 1926, ethnic groups from Liberia's interior had begun migrating to Monrovia in search of jobs.
[9]
By 1937, Monrovia’s population had grown to 10,000, and it had 30 police officers.

Visiting US President
Jimmy Carter
and Liberian President
William Tolbert
wave from their motorcade, 1978.
In 1979, the
Organisation of African Unity
held their conference near Monrovia, and it was chaired by the then president of Liberia,
William Tolbert
. During his term, Tolbert improved
public housing
in Monrovia and cut in half the
tuition fees
at the
University of Liberia
. In 1980, a military coup led by
Samuel Doe
overthrew the Tolbert government and executed many of its members.
The
First Liberian Civil War
(1989 to 1997) and
Second Liberian Civil War
(1999 to 2003) severely damaged many buildings and nearly all the infrastructure in the city, particularly during the
siege of Monrovia
. There were major battles between Samuel Doe's government forces and
Prince Johnson
's forces in 1990, and during the
National Patriotic Front of Liberia
's assault on the city in 1992. During the wars, many children and youths were forced to be involved in the fighting, and were deprived of any schooling, and afterwards, many of them were left homeless.
In 2002,
Leymah Gbowee
organized the
Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace
, as part of which, in Monrovia, local women gathered in a fish market to pray and sing.
[11]
This movement helped to end the war the following year, and to bring about the election of
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
as president of Liberia, which thereby became the first African nation to have a
female president
.
[12]
In 2014, the city was affected by the
2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak
.
[13]
The
Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia
was declared to be over on 3 September 2015.
Geography
[

The Atlantic Ocean as seen from Monrovia.
Monrovia lies along the Cape Mesurado peninsula, between the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mesurado River
, whose mouth forms a large natural harbor. The
Saint Paul River
lies directly north of the city and forms the northern boundary of
Bushrod Island
, which is reached by crossing the "New Bridge" from downtown Monrovia. Monrovia is located in
Montserrado County
and is Liberia's largest city and its administrative, commercial and financial center.

[16]
It has a
wet season
and a
dry season
, but gets precipitation even during the dry season. Temperatures are fairly constant throughout the year, averaging around 26.4 °C (79.5 °F). The only slight difference are the high temperatures as they are around 27 °C (81 °F) in the winter and near 32 °C (90 °F) in the summer with lows being around 22-24 year round

Population density and low elevation coastal zones. Monrovia is especially vulnerable to
sea level rise
.
Monrovia comprises several districts spread across the Mesurado peninsula; the greater metropolitan area encircles the mouth of the marshy Mesurado River. The historic downtown area, centered on Broad Street, is at the very end of the peninsula; the major market district, Waterside, immediately to its north, faces the city's large natural harbor.
Northwest of Waterside is the large, low-income
West Point
community. To the west and southwest of the downtown area is Mamba Point, traditionally the city's principal diplomatic quarter and home to the embassies of the United States and United Kingdom, as well as the European Union delegation. South of the city center is Capitol Hill, where the major institutions of the national government, including the
Temple of Justice
and the Executive Mansion, are located.
Further east along the peninsula is the
Sinkor
section of Monrovia. Originally a suburban residential district, today Sinkor is the bustling midtown section of the city. It includes many diplomatic missions, major hotels, businesses, and residential neighborhoods, including informal communities such as Plumkor, Jorkpentown, Lakpazee and Fiamah.
Sinkor is also home to the city's secondary airport,
Spriggs Payne
, and the area immediately next to the airport, called Airfield, is a major nightlife district for the whole city. East of the Airfield is the Old Road section of Sinkor, which is predominantly residential, and includes informal settlements such as
Chugbor
and
Gaye Town
.
At the southeastern base of the peninsula is the independent township of Congo Town, and to its east is the large suburb of
Paynesville
. Other suburbs, such as
Chocolate City
,
Gardnersville
,
Barnesville
,
Kaba Town
,
Dandawailo
, and
New Georgia
lie to the north, across the river. On
Bushrod Island
, north of Monrovia, are the neighborhoods of
Clara Town
,
Logan Town
and

Market stall in central Monrovia
Monrovia's economy is dominated by its harbor - the
Freeport of Monrovia
- and as the location of Liberia's government offices. Monrovia's harbor was significantly expanded by U.S. forces during the
Second World War
and the main exports include
latex
and
iron ore
.
Materials are also manufactured on-site, such as
cement
, refined
petroleum
, food products,
brick
and
tile
, furniture, and
chemicals
. Located on
Bushrod Island
between the mouths of the
Mesurado
and
Saint Paul
rivers, the harbor also has facilities for storing and repairing vessels.

.
[20]
Monrovia is connected with the rest of the country via a network of roads and railways. Monrovia is listed as the home port by between ten and fifteen percent of the world's merchant shipping, registered in Liberia under
Flag of Convenience
arrangements. Both private taxis and minibuses run in the city, and are supplemented by larger buses run by the
Monrovia Transit Authority
.
In recent years (2005-present) the roads on many streets in Monrovia have been rebuilt by the World Bank and the Liberian Government. Private and public infrastructures are being built or renovated as reconstruction takes place.
Administration and government
[
edit
]
Liberian Capitol Building.
Monrovia is situated in the
district
of
Greater Monrovia
in
Montserrado County
. Instead of being divided into
clans
like other districts of Liberia, Greater Monrovia is divided into 16 "zones". Like clans, these zones are
subdivided into 161 communities
.
[21]
[22]
Greater Monrovia does not have an organized district administration like other districts, with all lower-level local authorities being directly supervised by the Montserrado County Superintendent.
[23]
Municipally, Greater Monrovia District is subdivided into two city corporations and ten other local authorities (nine townships and one borough).
[22]
[24]
Established by law in 1973
[25]
and operational since 1976,
[26]
the Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) is responsible for the city's administration. The MCC also provides services to the townships and borough through a revenue-sharing arrangement, but has no zoning or enforcement jurisdiction in them.

The newspaper industry in Monrovia dates back to the 1820s, with the founding of the
Liberia Herald
, one of the first newspapers to be published in Africa. Today, numerous
tabloid
-style newspapers are printed daily or bi-weekly, most are 20 pages or less. The
Daily Talk
is a compilation of news and Bible quotations written daily on a roadside blackboard in the
Sinkor
section of Monrovia.

Monrovia also has radio and TV stations. Radio is the dominant source of news, because problems with the
electric grid
make watching television more difficult.
UNMIL
Radio has been broadcasting since October 1, 2003, and is the only radio station in Liberia that is on the air 24 hours a day. It reaches an estimated

Pollution

Further information:
Environmental issues in Liberia
Dwellings along the

Pollution
is a significant challenge in Monrovia.
[42]
Piles of household and industrial rubbish tend to build up. The
World Bank
pays sanitation companies to collect it, but collections are irregular.
[42]
In 2013, the problem of uncollected rubbish in the
Paynesville
area of Monrovia became so acute that traders and residents burnt "the huge garbage piles that seemed on the verge of cutting off the main road" out of Monrovia to
Kakata
.
[42]
Flooding brings additional environmental problems to residents: flood water picks up the waste that has been deposited in swamps at the edge of residential areas, and spreads it around.
[42]
In 2009, only one-third of Monrovia's 1.5 million people had access to clean toilets.
[43]
Those without their own toilets defecate in the narrow alleyways between their houses, or on the beach, or into plastic bags that they dump onto nearby piles of rubbish or into the sea.
[43]
Congested housing, a lack of any requirement that landlords provide working toilets, and virtually no urban planning "have combined to create lethal sanitation conditions in the capital".

Description
[
edit
]
(Original description) The high, very narrow shell has a biconically fusiform shape. It is subscalar, bicarinated, strong, white. The axial
sculpture
shows very many unequal, strong, harsh, flexuous lines of growth, of which one every here and there is stronger than the rest. The spiral sculpture shows two keels, of which the upper and stronger lies a little above the middle of the
whorls
, is sharply pinched out, but has a rounded edge. There is a drooping, but straight-lined shoulder above, and the whorl is somewhat contracted below it, so that it has considerable prominence. T;he lower keel is a rounded, rather prominent thread, which is the more conspicuous from the contraction of the whorl below it into the suture. Between these two keels, more or less in the middle, lies a thread, which is more marked than any of the others which, coarse, unequal, and interrupted, closely cover the whole surface. Of these two or three in the line of the sinus on the shoulder, between the upper keel and the suture, are somewhat stronger, more regular, and swollen than the rest. While just below this point, where the lines marking the lower edge of the sinus run, the surface is almost free of spiral threads.
The colour of the shell is a porcellanous white. The epidermis is extremely thin, smooth, pale yellowish.
The
spire
is high, narrow, subscalar. The
apex
consists of 1¼ embryonic whorls, globose, smooth, and somewhat obliquely pressed down on one side at the extreme point. The 7½ whorls are narrow, angulated, with a straight drooping shoulder below the suture, slightly concave between the keels, contracted into the lower suture. The base is conical, and projects on the right side into a long, narrow, and very slightly twisted snout. The suture a fine, sharp, deeply impressed line. The
aperture
is club-shaped, being oval above, with a sharpish angulation at the upper point, and being prolonged into a long, rather
narrow, but slightly widening
siphonal canal
, which is open in consequence of the oblique cutting away of the columellar lip. The outer
lip
, which is thin, sharp, and patulous, with a slight contraction on the edge of the siphonal canal, leaves the body nearly at a right angle, and advances with a very slight convexity to the keel, above which lies the deep, thin-lipped, U-shaped sinus, whose lower margin lies parallel to, but a little above, the conical thread From the keel the lip has an edge which on the front is first convex and then very slightly receding, while on the side it is first convex and then concave to the point of the snout, where its course is very straight. The columellar lip is a thin porcellaneous glaze, spreads a little on the body, from which the spirals are slightly cut away. The lip is a little concave above, then straight, and is early and obliquely cut away on the front of the
columella
, where it is slightly prominent, and finally it runs out to the point of the snout as a thin edge bordering the siphonal canal.

TVP3
(formerly
TVP Regionalna
, known also as
Regionalna Trójka
or
Program 3 Telewizji Polskiej
) is a Polish TV channel, run by the
public broadcaster
,
TVP
and dedicated to the country's regions. It has regional branches in most of the major
Polish
cities and, similarly to the
France 3
in
France
or
Rai Tre
in
Italy
, for couple of hours every day it
broadcasts regional programming
, including local news and reports.
History
[
edit
]
In the beginning, TVP Regionalna existed only as an umbrella brand for TVP regional affiliates. By the late 1990s, all TVP affiliates were connected together into a single national network, producing local news as well as some shows which were broadcast nationwide.
In 2003-2007 from 7:30 to 22:30 it aired nationwide news bulletins every hour. It was also used as the
Polish
parliamentary channel, transmitting the
Sejm
meetings, parliamentary inquiry commission's proceedings and other major political events.
In 2005, four new regional bureaus were created by splitting one bureau each from
TVP Kraków
,
TVP Katowice
,
TVP Gdańsk
and
TVP Poznań
. This move increased the number of bureaus to 16, one for each Polish voivodeship.
In 2007 TVP3 was replaced by
TVP Info
. This channel has broadcast regional programming (from 17:00 to 20:00 and from 21:45 to 22:15 every day).
On September 1, 2013 local programs were separated from TVP Info and moved to the reactivated TVP Regionalna (from January 2, 2016 under the name TVP3). In fact, TVP3 is not a single channel but sixteen regional channels with local programming (currently from 7:00 to 8:15 and from 17:30 to 22:15 every day). The rest of the schedule fills a common program with magazines, documentaries and current affairs programs.
Its main offices are located at the
TVP
news compound in central
Warsaw
. TVP3 can be watched via TV aerial or cable networks and via DVB-T.
All TVP3 channels are not available on the satellite (except
TVP3 Warszawa
).

Super K Productions
was a 1960s American recording production company under
Buddah Records
, headed by producers
Jerry Kasenetz
and
Jeffry Katz
, whose groups specialized in
bubblegum pop
.  Their biggest successes were The
Ohio Express
, The
1910 Fruitgum Company
,
Crazy Elephant
and The
Music Explosion
.  Super K also had its own label of the same name in 1969, operated under Buddah Records, but it did not last as the bubblegum genre had already started to decline in popularity.
Not a company to depend on double-sided hits, many (but not all) Super K-produced singles were pressed with
B-sides
of either tracks recorded backwards or studio group instrumentals. This method was also employed earlier by producers
Phil Spector
and
Joe Meek
as a way of pointing a radio
DJ
to the "right" side of the singles.
In the 1970's they had a small Recording Studio and Production office in Great Neck, NY, on East Shore Drive, just north of Northern Blvd. on Long Island.

Wales
(
Welsh
:
Cymru
[ˈkəm.rɨ]
ⓘ
) is a
country
that is part of the
United Kingdom
. It is bordered by
England
to the
east
, the
Irish Sea
to the north and west, the
Celtic Sea
to the southwest and the
Bristol Channel
to the south. As of the 2021 census, it had a population of 3,107,494.
[1]
It has a total area of 21,218 km
2
(8,192 sq mi) and over 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline.
[7]
It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including
Snowdon
(
Yr Wyddfa
), its highest summit.
[13]
The country lies within the
north temperate zone
and has a changeable,
maritime climate
. The capital and largest city is
Cardiff
.
A distinct
Welsh culture
emerged among the
Celtic Britons
after the
Roman withdrawal from Britain
in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the
conquest of Wales
by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though
Owain Glyndŵr
led the
Welsh Revolt
against
English rule
in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (
Welsh
:
senedd
). In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the
English legal system
under the
Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542
. Distinctive
Welsh politics
developed in the 19th century.
Welsh Liberalism
, exemplified in the early 20th century by
David Lloyd George
, was displaced by the growth of
socialism
and the
Labour Party
. Welsh national feeling grew over the century: a nationalist party,
Plaid Cymru
, was formed in 1925, and the
Welsh Language Society
in 1962. A governing system of
Welsh devolution
is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the
Senedd
(Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of
devolved policy matters
.
At the dawn of the
Industrial Revolution
, development of the
mining
and
metallurgical
industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the
South Wales Coalfield
's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales's population. Two-thirds of the population live in
South Wales
, including Cardiff,
Swansea
,
Newport
and the
nearby valleys
. The
eastern region
of
North Wales
has about a sixth of the overall population, with
Wrexham
being the largest northern city. The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and
tourism
.
Agriculture in Wales
is largely
livestock
based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national
agricultural self-sufficiency
.
The country has a distinct
national
and
cultural identity
and from the late 19th century onwards Wales acquired its popular image as the "land of song", in part due to the
eisteddfod
tradition and rousing choir singing. Both
Welsh
and English are official languages. A majority of the population in most areas speaks
English
whilst the majority of the population in parts of the
north
and
west
speak Welsh, with a total of 538,300
Welsh speakers
across the entire country.
Etymology
Main article:
Etymology of Wales
The English words "Wales" and "Welsh" derive from the same
Old English
root (singular
Wealh
, plural
Wēalas
), a descendant of
Proto-Germanic
*
Walhaz
, which was itself derived from the name of the
Gauls
known to the Romans as
Volcae
. This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the
Western Roman Empire
.
[14]
Anglo-Saxons
came to use the term to refer to the
Britons
in particular; the plural form
Wēalas
evolved into the name for their territory, Wales.
[15]
[16]
Historically in
Britain
, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g.
Cornwall
) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g.
Walworth
in
County Durham
and
Walton
in
West Yorkshire
).
[17]
The modern Welsh name for themselves is
Cymry
, and
Cymru
is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced
[ˈkəm.rɨ]
) are descended from the
Brythonic
word
combrogi
, meaning "fellow-countrymen",
[18]
[19]
and probably came into use before the 7th century.
[20]
In literature, they could be spelt
Kymry
or
Cymry
, regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland.
[18]
The
Latinised
forms of these names,
Cambrian
,
Cambric
and
Cambria
, survive as names such as the
Cambrian Mountains
and the
Cambrian
geological period.

by Thomas Prydderch. Caradog was leader of the north Walian Celtic tribe, the
Ordovices
.
Wales has been inhabited by
modern humans
for at least 29,000 years
[22]
Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the
last ice age
, between 12,000 and 10,000
years before present (BP)
, when
Mesolithic
hunter-gatherers from
Central Europe
began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time, sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of
glaciers
by about 10,250 BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the
Irish Sea
. By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island.
[23]
By the beginning of the
Neolithic
(
c.
6,000 BP
) sea levels in the
Bristol Channel
were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today.
[24]
The historian
John Davies
theorised that the story of
Cantre'r Gwaelod
's drowning and tales in the
Mabinogion
, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time.
[25]
Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000 BP - the
Neolithic Revolution
.
[25]
[26]
They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built
cromlechs
such as
Pentre Ifan
,
Bryn Celli Ddu
, and
Parc Cwm long cairn
between about 5,800 BP and 5,500 BP.
[27]
Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from
Bronze Age
and
Iron Age
Celtic
cultures. Some historians, such as
John T. Koch
, consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of
a maritime trading-networked culture
that included other
Celtic nations
.
[28]
This "Atlantic-Celtic" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly
Hallstatt culture
.
[29]
By the time of the
Roman invasion of Britain
the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the
Deceangli
(north-east),
Ordovices
(north-west),
Demetae
(south-west),
Silures
(south-east) and
Cornovii
(east), centuries.
[25]
[30]
Roman era
Main article:
Wales in the Roman era
Map of the Roman invasion of Wales
The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the
Silures
and the
Ordovices
. Caractacus or
Caradog
, leader of the Ordovices, had initial success in resisting Roman invasions of north Wales but was eventually defeated.
[31]
[32]
Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of
south Wales
, where there is a legacy of Romanisation.
[33]
The only town in Wales founded by the Romans,
Caerwent
, is in south east Wales.
[34]
Both Caerwent and
Carmarthen
, also in southern Wales, became Roman
civitates
.
[35]
Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering
technology
to extract large amounts of
gold
,
copper
and
lead
, as well as lesser amounts of
zinc
and
silver
.
[36]
No significant industries were located in Wales in this time;
[36]
this was largely a matter of circumstance as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in
Brythonic
. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the
ruling of 212
that granted
Roman citizenship
to all free men throughout the Empire.
[37]
Further Roman influence came through the spread of
Christianity
, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th century, as a result of
Constantine I
issuing an
edict of toleration
in 313.
[37]
Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric
Gildas
, have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history.
[38]
In that year, the Roman general
Magnus Maximus
, or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from
Gaul
as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders.
[39]
The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties,
[40]
and as the father of the Welsh Nation.
[38]
He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the
Pillar of Eliseg
, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the
Fifteen Tribes of Wales
.
[41]
Post-Roman era

Wales in the Early Middle Ages
Britain in
AD
500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the
Britons
, here labelled
Welsh
. The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by
Germanic tribes
, whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the
Gaels
and
Picts
.
The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales.
[37]
After the
Roman departure
in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various
Germanic peoples
, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons. Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage.
[42]
By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule.
[37]
The kingdoms of
Gwynedd
,
Powys
,
Dyfed
,
Caredigion
, Morgannwg
, the
Ystrad Tywi
, and
Gwent
emerged as independent Welsh
successor states
.
[37]
Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles.
[43]
John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the
Celtic Britons
at
Badon Hill
against the Saxons, which was attributed to
Arthur
by
Nennius
.
[43]
Having lost much of what is now the
West Midlands
to
Mercia
in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances.
Aethelbald of Mercia
, looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built
Wat's Dyke
. According to Davies, this had been with the agreement of king
Elisedd ap Gwylog
of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the
River Severn
to the Dee estuary, gave him
Oswestry
.
[44]
Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of
Wroxeter
.
[45]
King
Offa of Mercia
seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as
Offa's Dyke
(
Clawdd Offa
). Davies wrote of
Cyril Fox
's study of Offa's Dyke: "In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near
Trelystan
, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near
Rhiwabon
, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden." And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built "on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the
River Wye
and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent."
[44]
However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research.
[46]
In 853, the
Vikings
raided
Anglesey
, but in 856,
Rhodri Mawr
defeated and killed their leader, Gorm.
[47]
The
Celtic Britons
of Wales made peace with the Vikings and
Anarawd ap Rhodri
allied with the Norsemen occupying
Northumbria
to conquer the north.
[48]
This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with
Alfred
, king of
Wessex
, with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to
Annales Cambriae
, in 894, "Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste
Ceredigion
and
Ystrad Tywi
."

The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as
Lloegyr
(Modern Welsh
Lloegr
), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole.
[a]
The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called
Saeson
, meaning "
Saxons
". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British
*
Walha
, meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'.
[50]
The Welsh continued to call themselves
Brythoniaid
(Brythons or Britons) well into the
Middle Ages
, though the first written evidence of the use of
Cymru
and
y Cymry
is found in a praise poem to
Cadwallon ap Cadfan
(
Moliant Cadwallon
, by
Afan Ferddig
)
c.
633
.
[15]
In
Armes Prydain
, believed to be written around 930-942, the words
Cymry
and
Cymro
are used as often as 15 times.
[51]
However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name
Cymry
over
Brythoniad
.
[52]
From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to
Rhodri Mawr
's (
r.
844-77) inheritance of
Gwynedd
and
Powys
. His sons founded the three dynasties of (
Aberffraw
for
Gwynedd
,
Dinefwr
for
Deheubarth
and
Mathrafal
for
Powys
).
Rhodri
's grandson
Hywel Dda
(r. 900-50) founded
Deheubarth
out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of
Dyfed
and
Seisyllwg
in 930, ousted the
Aberffraw
dynasty from
Gwynedd
and
Powys
and then codified
Welsh law
in the 940s.

List of rulers of Wales
and
Welsh rebellions against English rule
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as
king of Wales
. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival
Gruffydd ap Rhydderch
in battle and recaptured
Deheubarth
.
[54]
Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. He ruled Wales with no internal battles.
[55]
His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms.
[56]
John Davies
states that
Gruffydd
was "the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor."
[2]
Owain Gwynedd
(1100-70) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title
princeps Wallensium
(prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the
Berwyn Mountains
, according to Davies.
[57]
During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace.
[58]
Within four years of the
Battle of Hastings
(1066), England had been
completely subjugated
by the
Normans
.
[2]
William I of England
established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England).
[59]
Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the
River Wye
. The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as
Marchia Wallie
, the
Welsh Marches
, in which the
Marcher lords
were subject to neither
English
nor
Welsh law
.
[60]
The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed.
[61]
Owain Gwynedd
's grandson
Llywelyn Fawr
(the Great, 1173-1240), received the
fealty
of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at
Aberdyfi
, becoming in effect the first
prince of Wales
.
[62]
His grandson
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
secured the recognition of the title
Prince of Wales
from
Henry III
with the
Treaty of Montgomery
in 1267.
[63]
Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of
Llywelyn
's wife
Eleanor
, culminated in the first invasion by
King Edward I of England
.
[64]
As a result of military defeat, the
Treaty of Aberconwy
exacted
Llywelyn
's fealty to England in 1277.
[64]
Peace was short-lived, and, with the 1282
Edwardian conquest
, the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With
Llywelyn
's death and his brother prince
Dafydd
's execution, the few remaining
Welsh lords
did
homage
to
Edward I
.
[65]
The
Statute of Rhuddlan
in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the
Principality of North Wales
from 1284 until 1535/36.
[66]
It defined Wales as "annexed and united" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the
Justice of Chester
and
Justiciar of North Wales
, and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the
Justiciar of South Wales
.  The existing royal lordships of
Montgomery
and
Builth
remained unchanged.
[67]
To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles:
Beaumaris
,
Caernarfon
,
Harlech
and
Conwy
. His son, the future
Edward II
, was born at
Caernarfon
in 1284.
[68]
He became the first English prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the
Principality of Wales
.

After the failed revolt in 1294-95 of
Madog ap Llywelyn
- who styled himself Prince of Wales in the
Penmachno Document
- and the rising of
Llywelyn Bren
(1316), the last uprising was led by
Owain Glyndŵr
, against
Henry IV of England
. In 1404,
Owain
was crowned prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain (Castille) and Scotland.
[70]
Glyndŵr
went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including a Welsh parliament (
Welsh
:
senedd
) at
Machynlleth
. The rebellion was eventually defeated by 1412. Having failed
Owain
went into hiding and nothing was known of him after 1413.
[71]
[72]
The
penal laws against the Welsh
of 1401-02 passed by the
English parliament
made the Welsh second-class citizens. With hopes of independence ended, there were no further wars or rebellions against English colonial rule and the laws remained on the statute books until 1624.
[73]
Henry Tudor
(born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from
Richard III
in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition
Welsh law
were abolished and replaced by English law by the
Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542
during the reign of Henry VII's son,
Henry VIII
.
[74]
In the legal jurisdiction of
England and Wales
, Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the "
Principality of Wales
" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a "principality" only in a ceremonial sense.
[66]
[75]
The Marcher lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament.

Early modern period
Main article:
Early modern period in Wales
Dowlais Ironworks
(1840) by George Childs (1798-1875)
In 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620. This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy. Increase in trade and increased economic stability occurred due to the increased diversity of the Welsh economy. Population growth however outpaced economic growth and the standard of living dropped.
[77]
Prior to the
Industrial Revolution in Wales
, there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales.
[78]
These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the
manufacture of woollen textiles
, through to mining and quarrying.
[78]
Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth.
[78]
The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the
Swansea
area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at
Parys Mountain
on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century.
[78]
The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country.
[79]
In the north,
John Wilkinson
's Ironworks at
Bersham
was a major centre, while in the south, at
Merthyr Tydfil
, the ironworks of
Dowlais
,
Cyfarthfa
, Plymouth and
Penydarren
became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales.
[79]
By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40 per cent of all Britain's
pig iron
.
[79]
By the 18th century, lawyers, doctors, estate agents and government officials formed a
bourgeoisie
with sizeable houses.
[77]
In the late 18th century,
slate quarrying
began to expand rapidly, most notably in North Wales. The
Penrhyn Quarry
, opened in 1770 by
Richard Pennant
, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century,
[80]
and along with
Dinorwic Quarry
, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as "the most Welsh of Welsh industries",
[81]
it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the
South Wales coalfield
was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea,
Penarth
and
Barry
grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal.

A
Plaid Cymru
rally in
Machynlleth
in 1949, where the "
Parliament for Wales
in 5 years" campaign was started
Historian
Kenneth Morgan
described Wales on the eve of the
First World War
as a "relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6 million tons of coal extracted in 1913.
[83]
The First World War (1914-1918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed,
[84]
with particularly heavy losses of
Welsh forces
at
Mametz Wood
on the Somme and the
Battle of Passchendaele
.
[85]
The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the
Liberal Party
had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the
general election of 1906
, only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament,
Keir Hardie
of
Merthyr Tydfil
, represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields.
[86]
In 1916,
David Lloyd George
became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain.
[87]
In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales.
[88]
The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the
Labour Party
. When in 1908 the
Miners' Federation of Great Britain
became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians—the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century.
[89]
After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales's staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty.
[90]
For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the
Second World War
.
[91]
The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the
German Air Force
targeted the docks at
Swansea
,
Cardiff
and
Pembroke
. After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as
Bevin Boys
.
Pacifist
numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against
fascism
.
[92]
Plaid Cymru
was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK.
[93]
The term "
England and Wales
" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales's capital.
Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg
(The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out.
[94]
Nationalist sentiment grew following the
flooding of the Tryweryn valley
in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of
Liverpool
.
[95]
Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of
Capel Celyn
was submerged, highlighting Wales's powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament.
[96]
Separatist groupings, such as the
Free Wales Army
and
Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru
were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963.
[97]
Prior to the
investiture
of
Charles
in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure.

By the end of the 1960s, the policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy.
[100]
This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of
industrial estates
and improvements in transport communications,
[100]
most notably the
M4 motorway
linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the
recession of the early 1980s
saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.
[101]
Devolution
Main article:
Welsh devolution
The
Welsh Language Act 1967
repealed a section of the
Wales and Berwick Act
and thus "Wales" was no longer part of the legal definition of England. This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the
Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542
which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England. The
Welsh Language Act 1967
also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations.
[102]
Protest against the

In a
referendum in 1979
, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a
second referendum
on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent).
[103]
The
National Assembly for Wales
(
Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru
) was set up in 1999 (under the
Government of Wales Act 1998
) with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers.
[103]
The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country.
[104]
The Welsh Government says: "Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right."
[105]
[b]
The Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the
National Assembly for Wales
and allows further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act creates a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature.
[107]
Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law making powers of the National Assembly it is now able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement.
[107]
In the
2016 referendum
, Wales voted in support of leaving the European Union, although demographic differences became evident. According to
Danny Dorling
, professor of geography at Oxford University, votes for Leave may have been boosted by the large proportion (21 per cent) of retired English people living in Wales.
[108]
After the
Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020
, the National Assembly was renamed "
Senedd Cymru
" (in Welsh) and the "Welsh Parliament" (in English), which was seen as a better reflection of the body's expanded legislative powers.

History of the Welsh language
The
Welsh language
(
Welsh
:
Cymraeg
) is an
Indo-European language
of the
Celtic family
;
[112]
the most closely related languages are
Cornish
and
Breton
. Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE.
[113]
The
Brythonic languages
ceased to be spoken in England and were replaced by the
English language
, which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the
Kingdom of Powys
.
[114]
The
Bible translations into Welsh
and the
Protestant Reformation
, which encouraged use of the
vernacular
in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
[115]
Successive Welsh Language Acts, in 1942,
1967
and
1993
, improved the legal status of Welsh.
[116]
The
Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011
modernised the 1993 Welsh Language Act and gave Welsh an official status in Wales for the first time, a major landmark for the language. The Measure also created the post of
Welsh Language Commissioner
, replacing the Welsh Language Board.
[117]
Following the referendum in 2011, the Official Languages Act became the first Welsh law to be created in 600 years, according to the First Minister at the time,
Carwyn Jones
. This law was passed by Welsh Assembly members (AMs) only and made Welsh an official language of the National Assembly.
[118]
Starting in the 1960s, many
road signs
have been replaced by bilingual versions.
[119]
Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official (
de jure
) language in any part of Great Britain.

[126]

Laws of Hywel Dda
By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at
Whitland
around 930 by
Hywel Dda
, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The '
law of Hywel Dda
' (
Welsh
:
Cyfraith Hywel
), as it became known, codified the previously existing
folk laws and legal customs
that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler.
[130]
Other than in the
Marches
, where
March law
was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the
Statute of Rhuddlan
in 1284.
Edward I of England
annexed the
Principality of Wales
following the death of
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until
Henry VIII of England
annexed the whole of Wales under the
Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542
(often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales.
[131]
[132]
The
Wales and Berwick Act 1746
provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of
Berwick
) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of
England and Wales
since 1536.
[133]
English law is regarded as a
common law
system, with no major
codification
of the law and legal
precedents
are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the
Supreme Court of the United Kingdom
which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The
Senior Courts of England and Wales
is the highest
court of first instance
as well as an
appellate court
. The three divisions are the
Court of Appeal
, the
High Court of Justice
, and the
Crown Court
. Minor cases are heard by
magistrates' courts
or the
County Court
. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single
jurisdiction
of
England and Wales
.
[134]
The
Senedd
has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the
UK Parliamentary
system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a
referendum
held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an
Act of Senedd Cymru
in relation to twenty subjects listed in the
Government of Wales Act 2006
such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the
Welsh Government
can then also enact more specific
subordinate legislation

: four in the southern half of the country, and
one
in
Wrexham
. Wales has no women's prisons: female inmates are imprisoned in England.

Wales is a generally mountainous
country
on the western side of central southern
Great Britain
.
[138]
It is about 170 miles (270 km) north to south.
[139]
The oft-quoted "
size of Wales
" is about 20,779 km
2
(8,023 sq mi).
[140]
Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the
Irish Sea
to the north and west,
St George's Channel
and the
Celtic Sea
to the southwest and the
Bristol Channel
to the south.
[141]
[142]
Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead.
[143]
Over 50 islands
lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being
Anglesey
, in the north-west.
[144]
Much of Wales's diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the
Devensian glaciation
. The highest mountains in Wales are in
Snowdonia
(
Eryri
), of which five are over 1,000 m (3,300 ft). The highest of these is
Snowdon
(
Yr Wyddfa
), at 1,085 m (3,560 ft).
[145]
[146]
The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including
Carnedd Gwenllian
- often discounted because of its low
topographic prominence
- over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the
Welsh 3000s
and are located in a small area in the north-west.
[147]
The highest outside the 3000s is
Aran Fawddwy
, at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia.
[148]
The
Brecon Beacons
(
Bannau Brycheiniog
) are in the south (highest point
Pen y Fan
, at 886 metres (2,907 feet)),
[149]
and are joined by the
Cambrian Mountains
in
Mid Wales
(highest point
Pumlumon
, at 752 metres (2,467 feet)).
[150]

National Parks
Wales has
three national parks
: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons, and
Pembrokeshire Coast
(
Arfordir Penfro
). It has
five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty
: Anglesey, the
Clwydian Range and Dee Valley
, the
Gower Peninsula
, the
Llŷn Peninsula
, and the
Wye Valley
.
[151]
The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
, in 1956. As of 2019, the
coastline of Wales
had 40
Blue Flag beaches
, three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator.
[152]
Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches, the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic
westerlies
/south-westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain.
[153]
The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the
Royal Charter
off Anglesey in which 459 people died.
[154]
The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year.
[155]
Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead,
Milford Haven
and Swansea.
[155]
Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the
Sea Empress
oil spill
in 1996.
[156]
The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary.
[157]
Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke.
[157]
The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye.
[157]
Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.
[157]
Geology
Main article:
Geology of Wales
The earliest
geological
period of the
Palaeozoic
era, the
Cambrian
, takes its name from the
Cambrian Mountains
, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants.
[158]
[159]
In the mid-19th century,
Roderick Murchison
and
Adam Sedgwick
used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of
stratigraphy
and
palaeontology
. The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the
Ordovician
and
Silurian
, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

Flora and fauna
Main article:
Biodiversity of Wales
Wales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of
gannets
,
Manx shearwater
,
puffins
,
kittiwakes
,
shags
and
razorbills
. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including
raven
and
ring ouzel
.
[171]
[172]
Birds of prey
include the
merlin
,
hen harrier
and the
red kite
, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife.
[173]
In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the
RSPB
reserve at
Conwy
, including seasonal visitors.
[174]
Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the
yellow-necked mouse
and the
dormouse
, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area.
[175]
The
pine marten
, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s.
[176]
The
polecat
was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading.
Feral goats
can be found in Snowdonia.
[177]
In March 2021,
Natural Resources Wales
(NRW) granted a licence to release up to six
beavers
in the
Dyfi Valley
, the first official beaver release in Wales.
[178]
Believed to be home to some of Wales's rarest land invertebrates, some 2,500 disused coal tips are the subject of study by the Welsh Government; the tips are home to a wide variety of other wildlife.
[179]
The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including
basking sharks
, Atlantic
grey seals
, leatherback turtles,
dolphins
,
porpoises
, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for
bottlenose dolphins
, and
New Quay
has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include
char
,
eel
,
salmon
,
shad
,
sparling
and
Arctic char
, whilst the
gwyniad
is unique to Wales, found only in
Bala Lake
. Wales is known for its shellfish, including
cockles
,
limpet
,
mussels
and
periwinkles
.
Herring
,
mackerel
and
hake
are the more common of the country's marine fish.
[180]
The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a
relict
pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily -
Gagea serotina
- and other
alpine
species such as
Saxifraga cespitosa
,
Saxifraga oppositifolia
and
Silene acaulis
. Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose
Tuberaria guttata
on Anglesey and
Draba aizoides
on the Gower.
[181]
Economy
Main article:
Economy of Wales
A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012
A 2021 introduction to some of the largest companies based in Wales, including: Airbus, bipsync, HCI Pharmaceutical, ReNeuron, Deloitte, Coaltown Coffee, DMM International and Freudenberg
Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a
predominantly agricultural country
to an industrial, and then to a
post-industrial economy
.
[182]
In the 1950s, Wales's GDP was twice as big as
Ireland
’s; by the 2020s, Ireland's economy was four times that of Wales. Since the Second World War, the
service sector
has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies.
[183]
in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data,
gross domestic product
(GDP) in Wales was £75 billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017. GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was £23,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017. This compares to Italy’s GDP/capita of £25,000, Spain £22,000, Slovenia £20,000 and New Zealand £30,000.
[184]
[185]
In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults
were employed
, compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole.
[186]
For the 2018-19 fiscal year, the
Welsh fiscal deficit
accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales's estimated GDP.
[187]
In 2019, Wales was a net exporter of electricity. It produced 27.9 TWh of electricity while only consuming 14.7 TWh.
[188]
In 2021, the Welsh government said that more than half the country's energy needs were being met by renewable sources, 2 per cent of which was from 363
hydropower
projects.
[189]
By UK law, Wales contributes to items that do not directly benefit Wales e.g. over £5 billion for
HS2
"which will damage the Welsh economy by £200m pa", according to the UK and Welsh Government's transport adviser Mark Barry. Wales also pays more in military costs than most similar-sized countries e.g. Wales pays twice the amount Ireland spends on the military.
[190]
The UK government spends £1.75bn per year on the military in Wales, which is almost as much as Wales spends on education every year (£1.8 billion in 2018/19) and five times as much as the total amount spent on the police in Wales (£365 million).
[191]
From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was the dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the
South Wales coalfield
, mining 56 million tons of coal.
[192]
Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool.
[193]
In the 1920s, over 40 per cent of the male Welsh population worked in
heavy industry
.
[194]
According to
Phil Williams
, the
Great Depression
"devastated Wales", north and south, because of its "overwhelming dependence on coal and steel".
[194]
From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in
light industry
and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of
foreign direct investment
in the UK.
[195]
Much of the new industry was essentially of a "branch (or "screwdriver") factory" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly-paid jobs in the company are elsewhere.
[196]
[197]
Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing, so
livestock
farming has been the focus of farming. About 78 per cent of the land surface is used for agriculture.
[198]
The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and
Blue Flag beaches
, attracts
large numbers of tourists
, who bolster the economy of rural areas.
[199]
Wales, like Northern Ireland, has relatively few high
value-added
employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of "economic mass" (i.e. population) - Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre.
[197]
The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK: in 2002 it stood at 90 per cent of the EU25 average and around 80 per cent of the UK average.
[197]
In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation to be awarded
Fairtrade status
.
[200]
The
pound sterling
is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century: the last bank to do so closed in 1908. Since then the
Bank of England
has had a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales.
[201]
The
Commercial Bank of Wales
, established in Cardiff by
Sir Julian Hodge
in 1971, was taken over by the
Bank of Scotland
in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002.
[202]
The
Royal Mint
, which issues the
coinage
circulating through the whole of the UK, has been based at a single site in
Llantrisant
since 1980.
[203]
Since
decimalisation
, in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008.
[204]
During 2020, and well into 2021, the restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the
COVID-19 pandemic
affected all sectors of the economy and "tourism and hospitality suffered notable losses from the pandemic" across the UK.
[205]
As of 6 April 2021, visitors from "red list" countries were still not allowed to enter unless they were UK residents. Restrictions will "likely be in place until the summer", one report predicted, with June being the most likely time for tourism from other countries to begin a rebound.
[206]
On 12 April 2021, many tourist facilities were still closed in Wales but non-essential travel between Wales and England was finally permitted. Wales also allowed non-essential retail stores to open.
[207]
Transport
Main article:
Transport in Wales
The
M4 motorway
running from West London to South Wales links
Newport
,
Cardiff
and
Swansea
. Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the
Second Severn Crossing
to
Pont Abraham
services, sits with the Welsh Government.
[208]
The
A55 expressway
has a similar role along the North Wales coast, connecting
Holyhead
and
Bangor
with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally
Chester
.
[209]
The main north-south Wales link is the
A470
, which runs from Cardiff to
Llandudno
.
[210]
Rail network of Wales, 2021
Rail transport in Wales
includes the
Wales & Borders franchise
, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by
Transport for Wales Rail
.
[211]
The Cardiff region has its own
urban rail network
.
Beeching cuts
in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the
Irish Sea
ports for ferries to Ireland.
[212]
Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of
Chester
and
Hereford
and towns of
Shrewsbury
,
Gobowen for Oswestry
and along the
Welsh Marches Line
, with trains on the
Heart of Wales Line
from
Swansea
to
Llandovery
,
Llandrindod
and
Knighton
connecting the Welsh March Line in
Craven Arms
. Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the
South Wales Main Line
branch of the
Great Western Main Line
used by services from
London Paddington
to Cardiff is
undergoing electrification
, although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns.
[213]
A
North-South railway
has been suggested to better link North and South Wales.
[214]
[215]
[216]
Cardiff Airport
is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of
Cardiff city centre
, in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by
Eastern Airways
.,
[217]
those flights are no longer, as of 2022, available. Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
[218]
Wales has four commercial
ferry
ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from
Holyhead
,
Pembroke Dock
and
Fishguard
. The Swansea to
Cork
service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012.

(
Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant
). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales.
[220]
A distinct education system has developed in Wales.
[221]
Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as
Ruthin
, Brecon and Cowbridge.
[221]
One of the first successful schooling systems was started by
Griffith Jones
, who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read.
[222]
In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south.
[222]
In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the
Welsh Not
was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented,
[223]
although the extent of its use is difficult to determine.
[224]
State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following the 1847 Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales - an event subsequently referred to as the
Treachery of the Blue Books
(
Welsh
:
Brad y Llyfrau Gleision
) - was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children.
[225]
The
University College of Wales
opened in Aberystwyth in 1872.
Cardiff
and
Bangor
followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the
University of Wales
.
[222]
The
Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889
created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution.
[222]
A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh.
[226]
Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales's state schools for pupils aged 5-16 years old.
[227]
While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the
Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol
(Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2021-2022, there were 1,470 maintained schools in Wales.
[228]
In 2021-22, the country had 471,131 pupils taught by 25,210 full-time equivalent teachers.
[229]
[230]
Healthcare
Main article:
Healthcare in Wales
University Hospital of Wales
, Cardiff
Public healthcare in Wales is provided by
NHS Wales
(
GIG Cymru
), through
seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts
. It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the
National Health Service Act 1946
, but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969.
[231]
Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the
Minister for Health and Social Services
.
[232]
Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions.
[233]
As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals.
[233]
In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales.
[233]
NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales's biggest employer.
[234]
The National Survey for Wales in 2021-22 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health.
[235]
The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease.
[236]
The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were
smokers
, 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week.
[237]
According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight.

The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially
Glamorganshire
, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911.
[242]
Part of this increase can be attributed to the
demographic transition
seen in most industrialising countries during the
Industrial Revolution
, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups,
[243]
including
Italians
, who migrated to South Wales.
[244]
Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British
Commonwealth of Nations
in the 20th century, and
African-Caribbean
and
Asian
communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh.
[245]
The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net
migration
out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to
population growth
than
natural change
.
[246]
The resident population of Wales in 2021 according to the
census
was 3,107,500 (1,586,600 female and 1,521,000 male), an increase of 1.4 per cent over 2011. A decreased change from the 5 per cent increase between 2001 and 2011.
[247]
Wales accounted for 5.2 per cent of the
population of England and Wales
in 2021.
Wales has seven cities
, those being Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, and Wrexham, with the communities of
Bangor
,
St Asaph
and
St Davids
also having
city status in the United Kingdom
.
[248]
Wrexham, north Wales's largest settlement, became Wales's newest and seventh city in September
2022

Welsh language
and
Welsh-speaking population
The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census who said they could speak Welsh
Welsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011.
[251]
Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd.
[252]
The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to a low of 18.9 per cent in 1981.
[253]
The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century.
[254]
In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991). Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7 per cent of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.
[255]
According to the
2021 census
, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 17.8 per cent (538,300 people) and nearly three quarters of the population in Wales said they had no Welsh language skills.
[256]
Other estimates suggest that 29.7 per cent (899,500) of people aged three or older in Wales could speak Welsh in June 2022.
[257]
English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country.
Code-switching
is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists.
[258]
"
Wenglish
" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh.
[259]
Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. Although
monoglotism
in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs.
[260]
Since
Poland
joined the
European Union
, Wales has seen a significant increase in Polish immigrants. This has made
Polish
the most common main language in Wales after English or Welsh, at 0.7 per cent of the population.
[261]
Religion
Main article:
Religion in Wales
St. David's Cathedral
, Pembrokeshire
Forms of
Christianity
have dominated religious life in what is now the Wales for more than 1,400 years.
[262]
[263]
The 2021 census recorded 46.5 per cent had "No religion", more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011.
[264]
The largest religion in Wales is
Christianity
, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census.
[264]
The
patron saint
of Wales is
Saint David
(
Dewi Sant
), with
Saint David's Day
(
Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Sant
) celebrated annually on 1 March.
[265]
The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the
1904-1905 Welsh Revival
, which started through the evangelism of
Evan Roberts
and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity.
[266]
The
Church in Wales
with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations.
[267]
It is a province of the
Anglican Communion
, and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the
Welsh Church Act 1914
. The first
Independent Church
in Wales was founded at
Llanvaches
in 1638 by
William Wroth
. The
Presbyterian Church of Wales
was born out of the
Welsh Methodist revival
in the 18th century and seceded from the
Church of England
in 1811.
[268]
The second largest attending faith in Wales is
Roman Catholic
, with an estimated 43,000 adherents.
[267]
Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population.
[269]
Islam
is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census.
[269]
There are also communities of
Hindus
and
Sikhs
, mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of
Buddhists
is in the western rural county of
Ceredigion
.
[270]
Judaism
was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000
[271]
and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.
[272]
Ethnicity

The 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as "White", compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011. 90.6 per cent of the population identified as "White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British" in 2021. The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was "Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British" at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011. 1.6 per cent of the population identified as "Mixed or multiple ethnic groups", compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as "Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African", compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as "Other ethnic group" compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011. The local authorities with the highest proportions of "high-level" ethnic groups other than "White" were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011.
[273]
In 2021, the first statue of a named, non-fictional woman outdoors was raised for Wales's first black headteacher,
Betty Campbell
. In 2023,
Patti Flynn
(a contemporary of
Shirley Bassey
, both of
Tiger Bay
, Cardiff) became the first black Welsh woman to be awarded a purple plaque.
[274]
National identity
Main article:
Welsh national identity
The 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as "Welsh only" and 8.1 per cent identified as "Welsh and British", giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh.
[275]
The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001.
[276]
A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree.
[277]
Culture
Main article:
Culture of Wales
Wales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music. There are four
UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales
:
The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd
;
Pontcysyllte Aqueduct
and Canal; the
Blaenavon Industrial Landscape
; and
The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales
.
[278]
Mythology
Main article:
Welsh mythology
Remnants of native Celtic
mythology
of the pre-Christian
Britons
was passed down orally by the
cynfeirdd
(the early poets).
[279]
Some of their work survives in later
medieval Welsh manuscripts
: the
Black Book of Carmarthen
and the
Book of Aneirin
(both 13th-century); the
Book of Taliesin
and the
White Book of Rhydderch
(both 14th-century); and the
Red Book of Hergest
(c. 1400).
[279]
The
prose
stories from the White and Red Books are known as the
Mabinogion
.
[280]
Poems such as
Cad Goddeu
(The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the
Welsh Triads
and the
Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain
, also contain mythological material.
[281]
These texts include the earliest forms of the
Arthurian legend
and the traditional history of post-
Roman Britain
.
[279]
Other sources of Welsh
folklore
include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation
Historia Britonum
(the History of the Britons) and
Geoffrey of Monmouth
's 12th-century Latin
chronicle
Historia Regum Britanniae
(the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as
The Welsh Fairy Book
by W. Jenkyn Thomas.
[282]
Literature
Main articles:
Literature of Wales (Welsh language)
,
List of Welsh writers
, and
Literature of Wales (English language)
Welsh poetry from the 13th-century
Black Book of Carmarthen
.
Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe
[283]
going back to the sixth century and including
Geoffrey of Monmouth
and
Gerald of Wales
, regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages.
[283]
The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets
Taliesin
and
Aneirin
, survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions.
[283]
Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the
Poets of the Princes
(
c.
1100
-1280) and then the
Poets of the Gentry
(
c.
1350
-1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the
cywydd
metre.
[284]
The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets,
Dafydd ap Gwilym
.
[285]
After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.
[284]
Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits.
[286]
Renaissance scholars such as
William Salesbury
and
John Davies
brought
humanist
ideals from English universities.
[286]
In 1588
William Morgan
became the first person to translate the
Bible into Welsh
.
[286]
From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular.
[286]
By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers.
[287]
The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality.
[288]
Initially excluded, religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic.
[288]
Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include
Lady Charlotte Guest
's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose works of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of
Rhys Lewis
by
Daniel Owen
, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from the verbose Victorian Welsh style, with works such as
Thomas Gwynn Jones
's
Ymadawiad Arthur
.
[287]
The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by
T. H. Parry-Williams
and
R. Williams Parry
.
[287]
The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of
Rhydwen Williams
who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by
Saunders Lewis
, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.
[287]
The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of
Gwyn Thomas
,
Vernon Watkins
, and
Dylan Thomas
, whose most famous work
Under Milk Wood
was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time.
[289]
The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of
Saunders Lewis
and the burning of the Bombing School on the
Llŷn Peninsula
in 1936.
[290]
In poetry
R. S. Thomas
(1913-2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He "did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English".
[291]
Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include
Emyr Humphreys
(born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels,
[292]
and
Raymond Williams
(1921-1988).
[293]
Museums and libraries
The
National Library of Wales
,
Aberystwyth
Amgueddfa Cymru - Museum Wales
was founded by
royal charter
in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales. It operates at seven sites:
National Museum Cardiff
,
St Fagans National History Museum
,
Big Pit National Coal Museum
,
National Wool Museum
,
National Slate Museum
,
National Roman Legion Museum
, and the
National Waterfront Museum
. Entry to all sites is free.
[294]
The
National Library of Wales
, based in
Aberystwyth
, houses important collections of printed works, including the
Sir John Williams Collection
and the
Shirburn Castle
collection,
[295]
as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera and
Ordnance Survey
maps.

Works of
Celtic art
have been found in Wales.
[296]
In the
Early Medieval
period, the
Celtic Christianity
of Wales was part of the
Insular art
of the
British Isles
. A number of
illuminated manuscripts
from Wales
survive, including the 8th-century
Hereford Gospels
and
Lichfield Gospels
. The 11th-century
Ricemarch Psalter
(now in
Dublin
) is certainly Welsh, made in
St David's
, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence.
[297]
Some Welsh artists of the 16th-18th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy.
Richard Wilson
(1714-1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist; although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of
landscape art
grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the
Celtic Revival
.
[298]
The Bard
, 1774, by
Thomas Jones
(1742-1803).
An
Act of Parliament
in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the
Cardiff School of Art
opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but
Betws-y-Coed
became a popular centre for artists, and its artists' colony helped to form the
Royal Cambrian Academy of Art
in 1881.
[299]
The sculptor Sir William
Goscombe John
made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London.
Christopher Williams
, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London.
Thomas E. Stephens
[300]
and
Andrew Vicari
had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France.
[301]
Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe.
Augustus John
and his sister
Gwen John
lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir
Kyffin Williams
and
Peter Prendergast
lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world.
Ceri Richards
was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including
Surrealism
. Various artists have moved to Wales, including
Eric Gill
, the London-Welshman
David Jones
, and the sculptor
Jonah Jones
.
The Kardomah Gang
was an intellectual circle in Swansea, centred on the poet
Dylan Thomas
and the poet and artist
Vernon Watkins
, which also included the painter
Alfred Janes
.
[302]
South Wales had several notable
potteries
, one of the first important sites being the
Ewenny Pottery
in
Bridgend
, which began producing earthenware in the 17th century.
[303]
In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available, more refined ceramics were produced: this was led by the
Cambrian Pottery
(1764-1870, also known as "Swansea pottery"), and later
Nantgarw Pottery
near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1820 making fine
porcelain
, and then utilitarian pottery from 1833 until 1920.
[303]
Portmeirion Pottery
, founded in 1960 by
Susan Williams-Ellis
(daughter of
Clough Williams-Ellis
, creator of the Italianate village of
Portmeirion
,
Gwynedd
) is based in
Stoke-on-Trent
, England.

National symbols and identity
Main articles:
Welsh national identity
and
National symbols of Wales
The
red dragon
, a popular symbol in Wales.
Wales is regarded as a modern
Celtic nation
which contributes to its national identity,
[30]
[305]
with Welsh artists regularly appearing at
Celtic festivals
.
[306]
The
red dragon
is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation.
[307]
The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the
Historia Brittonum
.
Vortigern
(
Welsh
:
Gwrtheyrn
),
King of the Celtic Britons
, is interrupted whilst attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys. He is told by Ambrosius
[c]
to dig up two dragons beneath the castle. He discovers a red dragon representing the
Celtic Britons
, and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons. Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea.
[309]
As an emblem, the red dragon of Wales has been used since the reign of
Cadwaladr
,
King of Gwynedd
from around 655AD, and is present on the national
flag of Wales
, which became an official flag in 1959.
[310]
The banner of
Owain Glyndŵr
is associated with Welsh nationhood; it was carried into battle by Welsh forces during
Glyndŵr's battles
against the English, and includes four lions on red and gold.
[311]
The standard is similar to the arms of
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
(Llywelyn the Last), the last Prince of Wales before the conquest of Wales by
Edward I of England
. The design may also be influenced by the arms of Glyndwr's parents, both of whom had lions in their arms.
Owain Glyndŵr Day
is celebrated on 16 September in Wales and there have been calls to make it a national bank holiday.
[312]
[313]
[314]
The
Prince of Wales's feathers
is also used in Wales: it consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet, and the
German
motto
Ich dien
(I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including
the Welsh rugby union
, and Welsh regiments in the
British Army
, including the
Royal Welsh
, use the badge or a stylised version of it.
[315]
[316]
[d]
On 1 March, Welsh people celebrate
St David's day
, commemorating the death of the country's patron saint in 589.
[318]
It is not a recognised
Bank holiday
although there have been calls to make it so.
[319]
[320]
[321]
The day is celebrated by schools and cultural societies across Wales, and customs include the wearing of a
leek
or a
daffodil
, which are two national emblems of Wales. Children also wear the national costume.
[322]
The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by
David Lloyd George
.
[323]
This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek,
cenhinen
, and that for daffodil,
cenhinen Bedr
or St. Peter's leek.
[138]
A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.
[323]
Other Welsh festivals include
Mabsant
when parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church, although this is now rarely observed,
[324]
and a more modern celebration,
Dydd Santes Dwynwen
(St Dwynwen's Day), observed on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day.
[325]
"
Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau
" (English:
Land of My Fathers
)
is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team, as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions.
[326]
"
Cymru am byth
" ("Wales forever") is a popular Welsh motto.
[327]
Another Welsh motto "Y
Ddraig Goch
Ddyry Cychwyn" ("the
red dragon
inspires action") has been used on the
Royal Badge of Wales
when it was created in 1953.

More than 50
national governing bodies
regulate and organise their sports in Wales.
[329]
Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the
FIFA World Cup
,
Rugby World Cup
,
Rugby League World Cup
and the
Commonwealth Games
. At the
Olympic Games
, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a
Great Britain
team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events.
[330]
These include the
1958 Commonwealth Games
,
[331]
the
1999 Rugby World Cup
, the
2010 Ryder Cup
and the
2017 UEFA Champions League Final
.
[330]
[332]
Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in
North Wales
,
rugby union
is seen as a symbol of
Welsh identity
and an expression of national consciousness.
[333]
The
Wales national rugby union team
takes part in the annual
Six Nations Championship
and has also competed in every
Rugby World Cup
, hosting the tournament in
1999
. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions:
Cardiff Blues
,
Dragons
,
Ospreys
and
Scarlets
.
[334]
The Welsh regional teams play in the
United Rugby Championship
,
[335]
the
Heineken Champions Cup
if they qualify
[336]
and the
European Rugby Challenge Cup
, again dependent on qualification.
[337]
Rugby league in Wales
dates back to 1907. A professional
Welsh League
existed from 1908 to 1910.
[338]
Wales has had
its own football
league, the
Welsh Premier League
, since 1992.
[339]
For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the
English football league system
:
Cardiff City
,
Swansea City
,
Newport County
,
Wrexham
, and
Merthyr Town
.
[340]
The country has produced a considerable number of
footballers
who have played at international level.
[341]
At
UEFA Euro 2016
, the
Wales national team
achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals.
[342]
In international
cricket
, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the
England and Wales Cricket Board
(ECB), called the
England cricket team
, or simply 'England'.
[343]
Occasionally, a separate
Wales team
play limited-overs competitions.
Glamorgan County Cricket Club
is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship.
[344]
Wales has produced notable participants of individual sports including
snooker
,
[345]
track and field
,
[346]
cycling
,

[348]
and
boxing

American Sign Language Alphabet
Deaf Like Me
is a biographical book about a family who discovers their daughter, Lynn, is deaf, and deals with a language barrier. It was written by Thomas and
James Spradley
, Lynn's father and uncle, and originally published in 1979. It begins in November 1964, before Lynn was born, and ends in August 1975, when she was ten. A short
epilogue
by Lynn, 19-years-old, is included in the 1985 edition.
Background and publication
[
edit
]
This biography focuses on Tom and Louise Spradley, their children Bruce and Lynn, and the friends and family they interact with on their journey. The book begins in 1964 when the Spradley's are moving from Illinois to Minnesota and Bruce is an only child. Tom is a teacher and is willing to take a job in any city offered, so he and his family move from Illinois, to Minnesota, to Oklahoma, and finally to California, where most of Lynn's schooling takes place. Louise is a stay at home parent, so she is flexible to move around the country without many issues.
Deaf Like Me
was originally published as a hardcover edition by
Random House
in 1979. The paperback edition was published in 1985 by Gallaudet University Press, with the addition of Lynn Spradley's epilogue.
[1]
Main characters
[
edit
]
Tom Spradley
is the husband of Louise and the father of Bruce and Lynn and also the narrator of this story. He is a mathematics teacher at the college level and for a short time, the high school level. When the book begins, Tom is working at Wheaton College in Illinois and works there for four years. However, over the course of the book, he also works at Carleton College in Minnesota, University of Oklahoma, Northview High School and American River College, both in California. Tom is the sole provider for the Spradley family, since he is the only one with a paying job.
Louise Spradley
is the wife of Tom and mother of Bruce and Lynn. She is a stay at home mom who takes care of her children and occasionally paints. Louise's role as a stay at home mom is crucial because she is able to devote so much of her time to working with Lynn and teaching her how to lip-read. Her role as a stay at home mom enables their family to move around the country without many limitations.
Bruce Spradley
is the son of Tom and Louise and the brother of Lynn. His role in this book is fairly minimal but he experienced a similar life to the rest of his family. Bruce is about four years older than Lynn and seems to have had a relatively normal childhood. He is adaptable and is able to make new friends regardless of the state he lives in. Also, Bruce helps teach his sister to lip-read and learn sign language.
Lynn Spradley
is the daughter of Tom and Louise, the sister of Bruce, and is also the main character and reason behind the creation of this biography. Lynn was born profoundly deaf due to her mother's exposure to
rubella
early in her pregnancy. There is nothing mentally or physically wrong with Lynn besides the fact that she cannot hear.
Plot
[
edit
]
In 1964, Bruce, who was only around three years old, contracted rubella or German measles. In 1964 and 1965, there was a large rubella outbreak where “20,000 babies were born with
congenital rubella syndrome
” and the vaccination was not put in use until 1969.
[2]
Bruce quickly recovered, however, Tom and Louise are concerned that if Louise is pregnant and contracted the illness, it could cause their child to have birth defects like the doctor warned them.
In April 1965, Louise gave birth to Lynn and the doctor performed various tests and assured the Spradley's that Lynn was perfectly healthy. Every newborn baby now has their hearing screened before they leave the hospital, however, this procedure was not put into place until 1993.
[3]
Tom and Louise accepted the doctor's assessment and continued on with their lives until the Fourth of July, they became concerned because Lynn was not bothered by the wailing fire trucks or the bursting fireworks.
When she was 16 months old, Lynn's hearing was tested at the John Tracy Clinic
[4]
and she was found to be profoundly deaf. Once Lynn's deafness is proven to be true, Tom and Louise begin teaching her how to lip-read as opposed to how to sign.
Oralism
, which only allows children to speak not sign, was popular because people believed deaf children could one day talk just as well as hearing children.
[5]
Before Lynn was old enough to get a hearing aid, she used an auditory trainer, consisting of headphones, a microphone, and a control box, all used to amplify sounds.
[6]
Once she was the right age, Lynn received a hearing aid that took time for her to get accustomed to, but unfortunately did not provide much assistance. The point of both the auditory trainer and the hearing aids were for Lynn to learn how to use her residual hearing, the small amount of hearing abilities even someone with hearing loss has.
[7]
As Lynn got older, communication continued to become more of an issue for her and her family. She would have tantrums when those around her could not figure out what she was asking for. Tom and Louise attended meetings at her schools and found that other parents had similar issues with communication but had not found many ways to resolve them.
A few months before Lynn turned five, Tom and Louise began to realize that despite many years of lip-reading and trying to get their daughter to talk, she could only speak a few words and only lip-read common words. The Spradley's decided they wanted more for Lynn, so they began to learn
sign language
from some of their deaf friends. The whole family quickly picked up the language and realized how easy it now was to communicate with Lynn. She continued to learn to lip-read, but signing only improved Lynn's abilities.
Epilogue
[
edit
]
The epilogue, included at the back of the book in the paperback edition, was written by Lynn Spradley in 1985. In the epilogue, she mostly talks about the school she attended after learning sign language. Lynn went to a residential school for the deaf, from age twelve to age nineteen, when she wrote this piece. Lynn mentions that she is glad she was given the opportunity to learn sign language and states, “Deaf kids are just as smart as hearing kids. With sign language deaf kids can do anything.”

Chemical compound
trans
-4,5-Epoxy-(
E
)-2-decenal
is an oxygenated α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde
found in mammalian blood that gives blood its characteristic metallic odor.  It is used by predators to locate blood or prey.
[1]
Humans can smell it at a concentration of 1.5 pg/L in air,
[2]
at 15 ng/L in water and 1.3μg/L in oil.
[3]
It was permitted as a
food flavouring
in the
EU
until it was prohibited on 11 July 2017
[4]
on the grounds of possible genotoxicity, as observed from rat livers.
[5]
It can be formed during baking fats that contain
linoleic acid
. 13-Hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid and 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid are intermediates in the process.
[6]
The aldehyde also forms in cooked beef when it sits in the refrigerator for too long contributing to a stale smell.
[7]
It is also an important part of the smell of raw and cooked
mutton
.
[8]
Humans are more sensitive to the smell of
trans
-4,5-Epoxy-(
E
)-2-decenal than mice.

(née
Donna Elizabeth de Varona
; born April 26, 1947) is an American former competition swimmer, activist, and television sportscaster.
Biography
[
edit
]
Swimming career
[
edit
]
In 1960, de Varona qualified for the U.S. Olympic swimming team at age 13. She already held the world record in her signature event, the 400-meter individual medley, but the event would not be added to the Olympic schedule until the 1964 Olympics.  At the
1960 Summer Olympics
in Rome, De Varona swam for the U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the
women's 4×100 freestyle relay
, but she did not receive a gold medal because she did not swim in the event final.  Four years later at the
1964 Summer Olympics
in Tokyo, Japan, after she was well on her way to setting a career total of eighteen world best times and world records, she won the gold medal in the
women's 400-meter individual medley
. She defeated the second-place finisher by a margin of six seconds and set an Olympic record. She also earned a second gold medal as a member of the world-record-setting U.S. team in the
4×100-meter freestyle relay
.
[2]
[3]
De Varona appeared on the covers of
Sports Illustrated
,
Look
and
Life
magazines. In 1964, the Associated Press and United Press International voted de Varona the "most outstanding woman athlete in the world."
[4]
De Varona retired from swimming and began her career in the male-dominated world of sports broadcasting.
Professional life
[
edit
]
At the age of 17, she appeared on
ABC's Wide World of Sports
, becoming the youngest and one of the first women sportscasters for a national network.
[2]
[3]
Her groundbreaking career has earned her an
Emmy
, two
Gracies
and the opportunity to cover a wide variety of sports events including 17 winter and summer Olympic games. In 2006, she was inducted into the
Museum of Television & Radio
's first class of fifty "She Made It" pioneers in media.
While de Varona continued to pursue her television career, she also began her work in
Washington, D.C.
as an activist for sports and fitness opportunities for America's youth. Since her retirement from competitions in 1965, she has served five terms on the
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports
and has been appointed to Presidential Commissions under
presidents
Ford
,
Carter
,
Reagan
,
Clinton
, and
Bush
. A consultant to the
United States Senate
, de Varona took a leave of absence from her pioneering television career to help with the passage of the
1978 Amateur Sports Act
which restructured how Olympic sports are governed in the United States.  Subsequently, she was called back to the Senate to consult on amendments to the landmark Olympic legislation and eventually worked to promote and safeguard
Title IX
of the Equal Education Amendments Act which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational institution receiving Federal funding. Named a special advisor to President Clinton's
Drug Czar
, General
Barry McCaffrey
, de Varona helped with the establishment and funding for both the
United States Anti-Doping Agency
and the
World Anti-Doping Agency
, which are entrusted with eradicating the use of illegal substances to enhance performance in sports.
A promoter of women in sport, in the mid-1970s, she joined
Billie Jean King
in establishing the
Women's Sports Foundation
. She served as the first President (1979-1984) and subsequently, became the chairman and Honorary Trustee for the Foundation. Under de Varona's leadership, the Women's Sport Foundation initiated the Hall of Fame Dinner (now the Annual Salute to Women in Sports Awards Dinner), Travel and Training Grants, research projects, a toll-free telephone number and annual visits to Washington, D.C., to educate Congress about Title IX and the importance of providing sport and physical activity opportunities on an equitable basis to both men and women. Over the years, the Foundation has raised more than $30 million to support its programs.
From 1997 to 1999, de Varona chaired the organizing committee for the
1999 FIFA Women's World Cup
. Recognized as the most successful women's sporting event in history, de Varona, a
U.S. Olympic Hall of Famer
, is a recipient of the
Olympic Order
, the highest honor presented by the
International Olympic Committee
. In 1999,
Sports Illustrated for Women
ranked her on its list of the "100 Greatest Athletes."  She has also been awarded five honorary doctorates and in 2003, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) Honors Committee awarded her the
Theodore Roosevelt Award
.
In 2000, de Varona sued
ABC Sports
for $50 million, saying she was fired because of her sex and age. She filed the lawsuit after working at
ABC
for over 30 years. The suit was dropped in 2002 when ABC Sports rehired de Varona as an ABC &
ESPN
liaison for domestic and international sports, plus on-air work for certain events. She said "Filing was the hardest thing I'd ever done. I'd been associated with ABC since I was 14, when I was swimming, and I grew from commentator to producer to adviser to
Roone Arledge
", the first president of ABC Sports.
[5]
de Varona in 2012
In the fall of 2007, de Varona completed a documentary as a host, writer, and producer. This was done in observation of the 35th anniversary of Title IX, which was the legislation that outlawed discrimination in school programs, including sports. The
CSTV
documentary, which won a
Cine Golden Eagle Award
, focused on the impact of Title IX and how one recipient of a sports scholarship in America has been influential in changing attitudes and customs in the Middle East as well as within the International Olympic Committee.  The program featured Morocco's Minister of Sports,
Nawal El Moutawakel
, who in
1984
became the first Muslim and African woman to win an Olympic gold medal, and in 2012 was elected Vice President of the International Olympic Committee.
She was inducted to the
International Swimming Hall of Fame
as an "Honor Swimmer" in 1969.
[6]
In 2003, de Varona was inducted into the
National Women's Hall of Fame
in
Seneca Falls, New York
.
[7]
She also serves on the distinguished Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC), which recommends subjects who appear on U.S. postage stamps.  She is a 1986 graduate of
UCLA
and the mother of two children: Joanna Pinto and John David Pinto.
De Varona serves on the executive board of
Special Olympics
International and is a member of the International Olympic Committee's Women and Sports Commission.  She is also a board member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame and serves as an adviser to Jordan's
Prince Feisal
's Generations for Peace Foundation and
Tony Blair
's Beyond Sport Initiative.  Most recently, de Varona was appointed to the
United States Department of State
's Empowerment of Girls and Women through Sports Council by Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
. She is also President of DAMAR Productions, a marketing, consulting and events advisory company. She was also the chair of the Athlete Advisory Committee for the
2019 Aurora Games
.
[8]
Activism
[
edit
]
In 2020, de Varona, along with 300+ women athletes and activists, signed a letter to the National Collegiate Athletic Association in support of an Idaho law that bans
transgender women
student athletes from competing in women's and girls' sports.
[9]
Citing the importance of the letter to safeguard the integrity of women's sports, De Varona remarked, "I agree with the letter. Those that want to compete as transgender male to female athletes should be accommodated in a separate or more creative manner."
[10]
In 2021, de Varona joined the
Women's Sports Policy Working Group
, formed in opposition to President Joe Biden's
Executive Order 13988
that mandates blanket inclusion for all transgender women athletes. To achieve this end, the Order's stated goal is "protecting the girls’ and women's competitive categories, while crafting accommodations for trans athletes into sport wherever possible."
[11]
Personal life
[
edit
]
In 1986, de Varona graduated from the
University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA). Her younger sister is actress-director
Joanna Kerns
, who played Maggie Seaver on the ABC sitcom
Growing Pains
.
[2]
[3]
She and her husband, John Pinto, have two children, John David and Joanna.

for the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
from 2017 to 2021. Pak previously served as a member of the
Georgia House of Representatives
as a
Republican
from 2011 to 2017.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Pak was born in
Seoul
,
South Korea
. His family emigrated to United States, residing in
Apopka, Florida
, when he was 9 years old.
[4]
Pak is a graduate of
Stetson University
, where he earned a
Bachelor of Science
degree in
accounting
. He earned his
Juris Doctor
,
summa cum laude
and
Order of the Coif
, from the
University of Illinois College of Law
. In law school, Pak was a
Harno Scholar
, served as the notes editor for the recent decisions section of the
Illinois Bar Journal
, and was a member of the
Elder Law Journal
. In 2013, he was named Distinguished Alumnus of the Year by the University of Illinois College of Law.
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
After graduation, he
clerked
for
Richard Mills
of the
United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois
.
[2]
Pak served in the
Georgia House of Representatives
as a
Republican
from 2011 to 2017. After representing the
102nd District
from 2011 to 2013 and the
108th District
from 2013 to 2017, Pak opted not to run for re-election in the November
2016 election
.
[5]
[6]
Pak was previously a
federal prosecutor
. While serving as an
Assistant United States Attorney
, he led the prosecution of individuals who tried to steal
Coca-Cola
's
trade secrets
in order to sell them to
Pepsi
.
[7]
Pak is Georgia's first
Asian-American
U.S. Attorney, and he was the state's first Korean-American legislator.
[4]
United States Attorney
[
edit
]
In July 2017, Pak was nominated by President
Donald Trump
to become United States attorney for the
Northern District of Georgia
.
[7]
He was confirmed for the position by the
United States Senate
on September 28, 2017.
[8]
On January 3, 2021, Trump called top Georgia state election officials, a call which was recorded and later released, and pressured them to help him "find" more votes in order to overturn the election of
president-elect
Biden
. During the call, Trump referenced
Atlanta
and
Fulton counties
of Georgia and referred to the "
never-Trumper
U.S. attorney there." Pak's district included those counties. Pak resigned the next day, citing "unforeseen circumstances."
[9]
[10]
[11]
Resignation
[
edit
]
Pak resigned unexpectedly on January 4, 2021.
[12]
Justice Department
officials have declined to say whether Pak resigned voluntarily or was asked to do so.
[13]
However,
The Wall Street Journal
reported that Pak was
forced to resign
by senior
White House
officials in the Trump administration for not investigating
false claims
of
election fraud
"enough."
[14]
Trump immediately replaced Pak with
Bobby Christine
,
[15]
the Trump-appointed
U.S. attorney from southern Georgia
, bypassing top career prosecutor
Kurt Erskine
.
[13]
Christine also found no evidence of election fraud.
[16]
The
Justice Department inspector general
opened an inquiry into Pak's departure.
[17]
Pak told the
Senate Judiciary Committee
in August 2021 that top Justice Department officials had told him on January 3 that he would be fired by Trump if he did not say there had been widespread
voter fraud
in Georgia; resigning would pre-empt a public dismissal.
[18]
Pak has since returned to
private practice
.

Sendai
(
川内 軽巡洋艦
,
Sendai keijun'yōkan
)
was a
Sendai
-class
light cruiser
in the
Imperial Japanese Navy
. She was named after the
Sendai River
in southern
Kyūshū
.
Sendai
was the
lead ship
of the three vessels completed in her class of light cruisers, and like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a
destroyer
flotilla.
Service career
[
edit
]
Early career
[
edit
]
Sendai
was completed at the
Mitsubishi
Nagasaki
shipyards on 29 April 1924. Immediately on completion, she was assigned to
Yangtze River
patrol in China. She played an important role in the
Battle of Shanghai
in the opening stages of the
Second Sino-Japanese War
, and later covered the landings of Japanese forces in southern China.
Invasions of Southeast Asia
[
edit
]
Main article:
Japanese Invasion of Malaya
On 20 November 1941,
Sendai
became
flagship
of Destroyer Squadron 3 (DesRon 3) under
Rear Admiral
Shintaro Hashimoto
.
At the time of the
attack on Pearl Harbor
,
Sendai
was engaged in escorting transports carrying
Lieutenant General
Tomoyuki Yamashita
and the
Japanese 25th Army
to invade
Malaya
. At 23:45 on 7 December 1941,
Sendai
and her destroyer squadron (
Ayanami
,
Isonami
,
Shikinami
, and
Uranami
) commenced a bombardment of
Kota Bharu
, Malaya. They were attacked by seven
RAAF
Hudson bombers
, which sank one of the transports and damaged two others.
On 9 December 1941, the
submarine
I-65
reported sighting of
Royal Navy
Force Z
(the Royal Navy
battleship
HMS
Prince of Wales
,
battlecruiser
HMS
Repulse
and supporting destroyers). The report was received by
Sendai
, which relayed the message to
Vice Admiral
Jisaburō Ozawa
aboard his flagship, the
heavy cruiser
Chōkai
. However, the reception was poor and the message took another 90 minutes to decode. Moreover,
I-65
'
s report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by
torpedo bombers
of the 22nd Air Flotilla from
Indochina
.
On 19 December 1941, off Kota Bahru in the
South China Sea
,
Royal Netherlands Navy
submarine
HNLMS
O 20
sighted
Sendai
escorting the second Malaya Convoy's 39 transports. At 11:15,
Sendai
'
s
floatplane
, a
Kawanishi E7K
2 "Alf", spotted and bombed
O 20
, which was also attacked by the destroyers
Ayanami
and
Yūgiri
with
depth charges
. That night,
O 20
surfaced to recharge her batteries, and a flame from her engines' exhaust gave her away; she was sunk by
Uranami
.
Sendai
made three more troop convoy escort runs to Malay at the end of December 1941 and in January 1942. On the fourth run, on 10 January 1942, the US submarine
USS
Seadragon
spotted the convoy and fired two torpedoes at the last transport, but both missed. On the fifth run, on 26 January,
Sendai
and her convoy were attacked by the destroyers
HMS
Thanet
and
HMAS
Vampire
about 80 nmi (148 km) north of
Singapore
in the
Battle off Endau
. The torpedoes from the
Allied
vessels missed, and the destroyer
Shirayuki
and
Sendai
returned gunfire.
Thanet
was sunk, while
Vampire
was undamaged and escaped to
Singapore
.
From February through March,
Sendai
was assigned to cover Japanese landings in
Sumatra
, and in sweeping the sea lanes and the
Strait of Malacca
for British and Dutch vessels escaping from Singapore. At the end of March,
Sendai
covered the landing of one battalion of the
IJA's 18th Infantry Division
at
Port Blair
,
Andaman Islands
. At the end of April,
Sendai
returned to
Sasebo
for repairs.
Battle of Midway
[
edit
]
On 29 May 1942,
Sendai
departed with the Main Body of the
Combined Fleet
for
Midway
. The Main Body remained 600 nmi (1,110 km) behind Vice Admiral
Chuichi Nagumo
's First Carrier Striking Force and thus did not engage American forces.
Sendai
returned to
Kure
on 14 June 1942 without having seen combat.
Solomon Islands campaigns
[
edit
]
On 15 July 1942, DesRon 3 was reassigned to the Southwest Force to cover operations in
Burma
and
raids in the Indian Ocean
, arriving at
Mergui
, Burma 31 July. However, with American landings on
Guadalcanal
, the planned
Indian Ocean
operations were cancelled and
Sendai
was sent to
Makassar
,
Davao
and
Truk
instead, to escort troop convoys to
Rabaul
,
New Britain
and
Shortland
,
Bougainville
. On 8 September,
Sendai
shelled
Tulagi
, and on 12 September she and the destroyers
Shikinami
,
Fubuki
and
Suzukaze
bombarded
Henderson Field
, Guadalcanal.
Sendai
remained active in
Solomon Island
operations through November 1942, participating in both the
First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal
(where she remained as distant cover) and the Second
Naval Battle of Guadalcanal
(where she was attacked by the
battleship
USS
Washington
's 16 in (406 mm) main guns but escaped undamaged).
On 25 February 1943,
Sendai
was reassigned to the Eighth Fleet at Rabaul under Vice Admiral
Gunichi Mikawa
and remained on patrol around Rabaul through April. Returning to Sasebo in May,
Sendai
was repaired and modified. Her No.5 5.5 in (140 mm) gun mount was removed and two triple
25 mm AA gun mounts
and Type 21
radar
were installed. Repairs were completed 25 June 1943 and
Sendai
returned to Truk on 5 July. On 7 July, Rear Admiral
Baron
Matsuji Ijuin
assumed command of DesRon 3. During the next three months,
Sendai
operated out of Rabaul covering reinforcement convoys to
Buin, Papua New Guinea
and Shortland.
On 18 July 1943, off
Kolombangara
, the group was attacked by Guadalcanal-based
Marine
Grumman TBF Avenger
torpedo bombers, and two days later by
North American B-25 Mitchell
medium bombers but was not damaged; it also escaped damage after being bombed by a
Consolidated B-24 Liberator
heavy bomber on 1 November 1943.
The following day, 2 November 1943, at the
Battle of Empress Augusta Bay
, the Japanese fleet attempting to reinforce Bougainville was intercepted by Task Force 39 with the light cruisers
USS
Cleveland
,
Columbia
,
Montpelier
and
Denver
and destroyers
USS
Stanly
,
Charles Ausburne
,
Claxton
,
Dyson
,
Converse
,
Foote
,
Spence
and
Thatcher
. The Japanese force included the cruisers
Myōkō
,
Haguro
,
Sendai
and
Agano
with destroyers
Shigure
,
Samidare
,
Shiratsuyu
,
Naganami
,
Wakatsuki
,
Hatsukaze
.
Shigure
spotted the American destroyers at 7,500 yd (6,900 m), turned hard starboard and launched eight torpedoes.
Sendai
also turned hard starboard, but bore down on
Shigure
, barely avoiding a collision. All four Allied cruisers took
Sendai
under radar directed 6-inch fire. They hit her with their first salvo and more thereafter, setting her afire.
Sendai
sank the following morning at
, along with
Hatsukaze
. Captain Shoji and 184 crewmen went down with the ship, but 236 other crewmen were rescued by destroyers.
On 3 November 1943, Admiral Ijuin and 75 more survivors from
Sendai
were rescued by the
Japanese submarine
Ro-104
.
Sendai
was removed from the Navy List on 5 January 1944.

Experience Center.
[7]
The facility was expected to be operational in the fall of 2019 or by late 2019. Construction of the structures are in the advanced stages.
[8]
The building permit for the city of Pickering to go ahead with this development has cost $1.6 million.
The City of Pickering, the Durham Region and Toronto governing authorities are actively involved in this project due to the magnitude of investment and effects on zoning bylaws.
[9]
The first phase of the development, the casino, was opened to the general public on July 26, 2021.

Patrick Leland Rapp
(born July 13, 1967) is an American former professional baseball right-handed
pitcher
in
Major League Baseball
(MLB).
Early life and career
[
edit
]
Rapp was a student at Sulphur High School in
Sulphur, Louisiana
. After high school, Rapp attended the
University of Southern Mississippi
. He was drafted by the
San Francisco Giants
in the 15th round of the 1989 amateur draft. Rapp's career through the Giants' minor league system included stops at
Pocatello, Idaho
,
Clinton, Iowa
,
San Jose, California
,
Shreveport, Louisiana
, and
Phoenix, Arizona
, before getting called up to the big leagues by the Giants in 1992 at the age of 24. Rapp had three children when he was called up to the major leagues.
Major league career
[
edit
]
Rapp's major league debut was on July 10, 1992, as he pitched two scoreless innings against the
Montreal Expos
. He finished the season 0-2, with an
ERA
of 7.00 in 10 innings pitched. On November 17, 1992, during the 1992 Major League Expansion Draft held for the newly minted
Florida Marlins
and
Colorado Rockies
, Rapp was selected in the first round with the tenth overall pick by the Marlins. During the Marlins' first season in 1993, Rapp went 4-6 with a 4.02 ERA in 94 innings. During the strike shortened 1994 season, Rapp compiled a record of 7-8 with a 3.85 ERA, two complete games and his first career shutout. On September 18, 1995, Rapp pitched a one hitter on the road against the Rockies as the Marlins won 17-0. The only hit given up by Rapp was a bloop single by
Dante Bichette
in the fourth inning. It was only the second shutout loss suffered by the Rockies in 1995. In 1995, Rapp had a record of 14-7 with an ERA of 3.44. He had a stretch where he went 11-2 after the All-Star break.
In November 1995, Rapp had a surgery for a herniated disc in his back, but made it to spring training in 1996. During the 1996 season, Rapp went 8-16 with an ERA of 5.10. Rapp's 16 losses led the National League, along with
Frank Castillo
of the
Chicago Cubs
. In 1997, Rapp returned after an offseason training regimen of throwing footballs to build arm strength. He threw a shutout against the Rockies early in April, his first shutout since 1995. After starting the season 4-6 with an ERA of 4.47, Rapp was traded to the team which first drafted him, the
San Francisco Giants
for minor league pitchers Brandon Leese and Bobby Rector. Rapp finished up the 1997 season with San Francisco with a 1-2 record and an ERA of 6.00.
He was granted free agency on December 21, 1997, and signed with the
Kansas City Royals
on January 22, 1998. Rapp's 1998 season with Kansas City saw him finish 12-13, with a career high in strikeouts with 132 and an ERA of 5.30. The Royals granted Rapp free agency in December 1998 and he signed another one-year deal, this with the
Boston Red Sox
on January 11, 1999. Rapp went 6-7 for Boston with an ERA of 4.12. His 90 strikeouts were second on the Red Sox behind staff ace
Pedro Martínez
. Rapp worked 1.0 inning in the 1999 playoffs, against the
New York Yankees
, allowing one walk. After his one season in Boston, Rapp was granted free agency on November 2, 1999, and signed with the
Baltimore Orioles
on January 28, 2000. Rapp stated that all of his other offers at the time were non roster invitations. Rapp started the 2000 campaign 3-0, then learned that his father was ill with a lethal bacterial infection, sustained from cutting his leg while fishing. The infection caused the leg to swell to three times its normal size and put him into a coma. Rapp's form began to falter, his father dying in the middle of the 2000 season. Emotionally drained, Rapp returned to the Orioles on August 18 and pitched against the Royals, retiring 17 consecutive batters from the first inning onwards. Rapp finished his lone season with the Orioles with a mark of 9-12, a 5.90 ERA and 106 strikeouts.
Rapp was once again granted free agency on October 31, 2000, and signed by the Angels on December 11 of that year. Rapp's final season in the majors proved to be 2001; he finished the campaign with a record of 5-12 and an ERA of 4.68, with one complete game. He was granted free agency once again in November 2001. Rapp was signed by the Pirates to a minor league contract. In 2002, Rapp pitched in spring training, but was released on March 21. He felt that the team was not giving him enough chances to make the starting rotation. In four spring appearances, Rapp allowed 10 earned runs and 16 hits in 10.1 innings. General manager
Dave Littlefield
said that Rapp was not given his unconditional release due to the fact of his complaints but because he "Could not pitch deep into games. He has trouble after a couple of innings." Rapp threw a low 90s fastball, cutter and curveball.

, spending six years with the club. Nijholt was a member of the famous Haarlem team that competed in the
UEFA Cup
in the 1982-83 season, for the first time in the club's history. However this campaign was to be overshadowed by the
Luzhniki disaster
. He then moved on to single seasons with
AZ
,
Utrecht
and Swiss side
Old Boys
. In 1990, Nijholt moved to Scottish side
Motherwell
and helped them win the
Scottish Cup
in his first season.
In 1993, he moved to English]side
Swindon Town
for a fee of £175,000, spending two years with
The Robins
. He joined them after they won promotion to the
FA Premier League
, but couldn't prevent from being relegated after just one reason with a mere five wins and a defence that leaked 100 goals in the league. However, he did score his only goal for Swindon on 19 March 1994 in a surprise 2-2 home draw against that season's
double
winners Manchester United. A year later he was part of the side which reached the
Football League Cup
semi finals but suffered a second successive relegation.
After leaving Swindon in 1995, Nijholt joined Volendam and spent three years with them before retiring in 1998.
Nijholt became manager of
Stormvogels Telstar
in 2005 and has since declared his interest in managing former clubs Swindon
[2]
and Motherwell,
[3]
although neither application was successful.
He was the assistant coach of
FC Red Bull Salzburg
(Austria) during 2008-09 season. In 2010, he reunited with
Co Adriaanse
to be part of his coaching staff with the Qatar national team.
[4]
In 1984 his then 21 year old girlfriend Sandra van Raalte was murdered in the clothing store where she worked. The case is known as the ‘paskamermoord’. The changing room murder.

Musical artist
Arandel
is a French musical project. The album
In D
(a nod to
Terry Riley
In C
album) lays the foundations of a
dogma
only allowing music instruments use and banning
samplers
and other
MIDI
devices. Encouraging the concept of a creator's vanishing behind its creation, Arandel is an anonymous project, which members and actual composition remain unknown. To that end, any representation or identification of its contributors is prohibited, especially live photographs and videos.
Anecdotes

Arandel means "

Haute-Savoie
regional dialect.
An Arandel live version, whose composition is always moving, is currently touring. The first show took place on August 2010 during “

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Kenneth John Monkou
(born 29 November 1964) is a Dutch former professional
footballer
and pundit.
As a player, he was as a
centre-back
who notably played in the
Premier League
for both
Chelsea
and
Southampton
, where he played just under 300 league appearances for both. He had previously played in the
Eredivise
for
Feyenoord
and wound up his career in the
Football League
with
Huddersfield Town
.
Monkou is an ambassador for the
Professional Footballers' Association
and
Show Racism the Red Card
. He has also appeared as a pundit for Chelsea TV.
Early life
[
edit
]
Monkou was born in
Nickerie
in
Suriname
and was raised in the Netherlands. He became passionate about football as a child in
The Hague
, where he played at RK-VVP.
Football career
[
edit
]
Monkou's first major side was
Feyenoord Rotterdam
. He played in a reserve match against a side featuring
Chelsea
manager
Bobby Campbell
's son and moved to England in May 1989 to play for newly promoted Chelsea for £100,000.
[1]
He was their first player from outside the
Commonwealth of Nations
since
Petar Borota
in 1982. He was voted club player of the year in his first season - the first black player to do so for Chelsea - as the team finished fifth in the
First Division
and won the
Full Members Cup
.
[1]
He remained with Chelsea until 1992, when he was transferred to
Southampton
for £750,000 three months after signing a new five-year contract with Chelsea.
[1]
Southampton faced regular battles for
Premier League
survival, though the club was never
relegated
during Monkou's time there. In the
1993-94 season
he scored a last minute winner in a 5-4 defeat of
Norwich City
from a
Matt Le Tissier
corner that helped the club stay in the
Premier League
.
[1]
He stayed on the South Coast until 1999, when he joined
Huddersfield Town
on a free transfer, scoring once against Yorkshire rivals Barnsley.
[2]
However, disagreements with Huddersfield manager
Steve Bruce
ensured his time with the club was short-lived.
[1]
Monkou made a return to Chelsea in 2003, playing for the reserve team, before finally retiring from the game.
[3]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Monkou's cousin
Arsenio Halfhuid
is also a footballer.
He ran a
Dutch pancake
house in the Dutch city of
Delft
[4]
and is actively involved in Dutch media and on Chelsea TV.
Monkou has also worked as a corporate hospitality host at
Stamford Bridge
, and is an ambassador for the
Professional Footballers' Association
and
Show Racism the Red Card
.

Quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer
For other uses, see
Data (disambiguation)
and
Datum (disambiguation)
.
For broader coverage of this topic, see
Data
.
Various types of data which can be visualized through a computer device
In
computer science
,
data
(treated as singular, plural, or as a
mass noun
) is any sequence of one or more
symbols
;
datum
is a single symbol of data. Data requires
interpretation
to become
information
.
Digital data
is data that is represented using the
binary number
system of ones (1) and zeros (0), instead of
analog
representation. In modern (post-1960) computer systems, all data is digital.
Data exists in three states:
data at rest
,
data in transit
and
data in use
. Data within a computer, in most cases,
moves as parallel data
. Data moving to or from a computer, in most cases,
moves as serial data
. Data sourced from an analog device, such as a temperature sensor, may be converted to digital using an
analog-to-digital converter
. Data representing
quantities
, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a
computer
are
stored
and
recorded
on
magnetic
,
optical
, electronic, or mechanical recording media, and
transmitted
in the form of digital electrical or optical signals.
[1]
Data pass in and out of computers via
peripheral devices
.
Physical
computer memory
elements consist of an address and a byte/word of data storage. Digital data are often stored in
relational databases
, like
tables
or SQL databases, and can generally be represented as abstract key/value pairs. Data can be organized in many different types of
data structures
, including arrays,
graphs
, and
objects
. Data structures can store data of many different
types
, including
01677877777
,
strings
and even other
data structures
.
Characteristics
[
edit
]
Metadata
helps translate data to information. Metadata is data about the data. Metadata may be implied, specified or given.
Data relating to physical events or processes will have a temporal component. This temporal component may be implied. This is the case when a device such as a temperature logger receives data from a temperature
sensor
. When the temperature is received it is assumed that the data has a temporal reference of
now
. So the device records the date, time and temperature together. When the data logger communicates temperatures, it must also report the date and time as metadata for each temperature reading.
Fundamentally, computers follow a sequence of instructions they are given in the form of data. A set of instructions to perform a given task (or tasks) is called a
program
. A program is data in the form of coded instructions to control the operation of a computer or other machine.
[2]
In the nominal case, the program, as
executed
by the computer, will consist of
machine code
. The elements of
storage
manipulated by the program, but not actually executed by the
central processing unit
(CPU), are also data. At its most essential, a single datum is a
value
stored at a specific location. Therefore, it is possible for computer programs to operate on other computer programs, by manipulating their programmatic data.
To store data
bytes
in a file, they have to be
serialized
in a
file format
. Typically, programs are stored in special file types, different from those used for other data.
Executable files
contain programs; all other files are also
data files
. However, executable files may also contain data used by the program which is built into the program. In particular, some executable files have a
data segment
, which nominally contains constants and initial values for variables, both of which can be considered data.
The line between program and data can become blurry. An
interpreter
, for example, is a program. The input data to an interpreter is itself a program, just not one expressed in native
machine language
. In many cases, the interpreted program will be a human-readable
text file
, which is manipulated with a
text editor
program.
Metaprogramming
similarly involves programs manipulating other programs as data. Programs like
compilers
,
linkers
,
debuggers
,
program updaters
,
virus scanners
and such use other programs as their data.
For example, a
user
might first instruct the
operating system
to load a
word processor
program from one file, and then use the running program to open and edit a
document
stored in another file. In this example, the document would be considered data. If the word processor also features a
spell checker
, then the dictionary (word list) for the spell checker would also be considered data. The
algorithms
used by the spell checker to suggest corrections would be either
machine code
data or text in some interpretable
programming language
.
In an alternate usage,
binary files
(which are not
human-readable
) are sometimes called
data
as distinguished from human-readable
text
.
[3]
The total amount of digital data in 2007 was estimated to be 281 billion
gigabytes
(281
exabytes
).
[4]
[5]
Data keys and values, structures and persistence
[
edit
]
Keys in data provide the context for values. Regardless of the structure of data, there is always a key component present. Keys in data and data-structures are essential for giving meaning to data values. Without a key that is directly or indirectly associated with a value, or collection of values in a structure, the values become meaningless and cease to be data. That is to say, there has to be a key component linked to a value component in order for it to be considered data.
[

Data can be represented in computers in multiple ways, as per the following examples:
RAM
[
edit
]
Random access memory
(RAM) holds data that the CPU has direct access to. A CPU may only manipulate data within its
processor registers
or memory. This is as opposed to data storage, where the CPU must direct the transfer of data between the storage device (disk, tape...) and memory. RAM is an array of linear contiguous locations that a processor may read or write by providing an address for the read or write operation. The processor may operate on any location in memory at any time in any order. In RAM the smallest element of data is the binary
bit
. The capabilities and limitations of accessing RAM are processor specific. In general
main memory
is arranged as an array of
locations
beginning at address 0 (
hexadecimal
0). Each location can store usually 8 or 32 bits depending on the
computer architecture
.
Keys
[
edit
]
Data keys need not be a direct hardware address in memory.
Indirect
, abstract and logical keys codes can be stored in association with values to form a
data structure
. Data structures have predetermined
offsets
(or links or paths) from the start of the structure, in which data values are stored. Therefore, the data key consists of the key to the structure plus the offset (or links or paths) into the structure. When such a structure is repeated, storing variations of the data values and the data keys within the same repeating structure, the result can be considered to resemble a
table
, in which each element of the repeating structure is considered to be a column and each repetition of the structure is considered as a row of the table. In such an organization of data, the data key is usually a value in one (or a composite of the values in several) of the columns.
Organised recurring data structures
[
edit
]
The
tabular
view of repeating data structures is only one of many possibilities. Repeating data structures can be organised
hierarchically
, such that nodes are linked to each other in a cascade of parent-child relationships. Values and potentially more complex data-structures are linked to the nodes. Thus the nodal hierarchy provides the key for addressing the data structures associated with the nodes. This representation can be thought of as an
inverted tree
. Modern computer operating system
file systems
are a common example; and
XML
is another.
Sorted or ordered data
[
edit
]
Data has some inherent features when it is
sorted on a key
. All the values for subsets of the key appear together. When passing sequentially through groups of the data with the same key, or a subset of the key changes, this is referred to in data processing circles as a break, or a
control break
. It particularly facilitates the aggregation of data values on subsets of a key.
Peripheral storage
[
edit
]
Until the advent of bulk
non-volatile memory
like
flash
, persistent data storage was traditionally achieved by writing the data to
external block devices like magnetic tape and disk drives
. These devices typically seek to a location on the magnetic media and then read or write
blocks of data
of a predetermined size. In this case, the seek location on the media, is the data key and the blocks are the data values. Early used
raw disk
data file-systems or disc operating systems reserved
contiguous
blocks on the disc drive for
data files
. In those systems, the files could be filled up, running out of data space before all the data had been written to them. Thus much unused data space was reserved unproductively to ensure adequate free space for each file. Later file-systems introduced
partitions
. They reserved blocks of disc data space for partitions and used the allocated blocks more economically, by dynamically assigning blocks of a partition to a file as needed. To achieve this, the file system had to keep track of which blocks were used or unused by data files in a catalog or file allocation table. Though this made better use of the disc data space, it resulted in fragmentation of files across the disc, and a concomitant performance overhead due additional seek time to read the data. Modern file systems reorganize fragmented files dynamically to optimize file access times. Further developments in file systems resulted in
virtualization
of disc drives i.e. where a logical drive can be defined as partitions from a number of physical drives.
Indexed data
[
edit
]
Retrieving a small subset of data from a much larger set may imply inefficiently searching through the data sequentially.
Indexes
are a way to copy out keys and location addresses from data structures in files, tables and data sets, then organize them using
inverted tree structures
to reduce the time taken to retrieve a subset of the original data. In order to do this, the key of the subset of data to be retrieved must be known before retrieval begins. The most popular indexes are the
B-tree
and the dynamic
hash
key indexing methods. Indexing is overhead for filing and retrieving data. There are other ways of organizing indexes, e.g. sorting the keys and using a
binary search algorithm
.
Abstraction and indirection
[
edit
]
Object-oriented programming
uses two basic concepts for understanding data and software:
The taxonomic rank-structure of
classes
, which is an example of a hierarchical data structure; and
at run time, the creation of references to in-memory data-structures of objects that have been
instantiated
from a
class library
.
It is only after instantiation that an object of a specified class exists. After an object's reference is cleared, the object also ceases to exist. The memory locations where the object's data was stored are
garbage
and are reclassified as unused memory available for reuse.
Database data
[
edit
]
The advent of
databases
introduced a further
layer of abstraction
for persistent data storage. Databases use
metadata
, and a
structured query language
protocol between
client and server
systems, communicating over a
computer network
, using a
two phase commit
logging system to ensure
transactional
completeness, when saving data.
Parallel distributed data processing
[
edit
]
Modern scalable and high-performance data persistence technologies, such as
Apache Hadoop
, rely on massively parallel distributed data processing across many commodity computers on a high bandwidth network. In such systems, the data is distributed across multiple computers and therefore any particular computer in the system must be represented in the key of the data, either directly, or indirectly. This enables the differentiation between two identical sets of data, each being processed on a different computer at the same time.

Alberto Lim
is a Filipino businessman. He was a former  Philippine Secretary of Tourism.
[1]
On June 29, 2010, President
Benigno Aquino III
picked him as his Secretary of Tourism.
[2]
He, however, quit his post on August 12, 2011, due to personal reasons.
[3]
Background
[
edit
]
Before being appointed by
Benigno Aquino III
to the Tourism secretary post, Lim was the president of the
Makati Business Club
, a group known to support Aquino even before the latter's campaign started.
[4]
Tourism Secretary
[
edit
]
He took over the helm of the Tourism Department from
Joseph Ace Durano
. Early speculations also pointed to showbiz talk host
Boy Abunda
as the new head of the Department of Tourism (DOT) but Abunda declined the post.
[4]
In appointing Lim, Aquino said: Tourism is seen as one of the key venues for increasing jobs in the country. We need someone who has proven competence in this field".
[4]
After
2010 Manila hostage crisis
ended in blood, Lim was appointed with Soliman by the president "to provide everything necessary for the recovery and return home of the survivors".
[5]
It is the first challenge faced by Lim after his appointment.
Lim was criticized for the tourism slogan
Pilipinas Kay Ganda
on the basis that foreigners did not understand clearly what it meant even though these people were the supposed object of the campaign message. Many notable people asked for his resignation until he finally decided to resign in August 2011.

Historical settlement in present-day Gatineau, Quebec, Canada
A painting of the mill and tavern in Wright's Town, 1823
Wright's Town
, also known as
Wrightstown
,
Wright's Village
, and
Columbia Falls Village
, was the first permanent colonial settlement in the
Ottawa Valley
, located at the north edge of the
Chaudière Falls
on the
Ottawa River
, on the southern part of what is now known as Hull Island, in present-day
Gatineau
,
Quebec
,
Canada
. Wright's Town was established by and named after American settler
Philemon Wright
, who settled in the area in 1800.
Though nothing remains of Wright's Town, its growth and legacy spurred the development of other settlements in the Ottawa Valley, including the settlement of
Bytown
across the river, which would eventually develop into the city of
Ottawa
,
Ontario
, the national capital of Canada.
History
[
edit
]
Wright's Town was founded by
Philemon Wright
, an American from
Woburn
,
Massachusetts
. In 1799, Philemon acquired a land grant from the
British Crown
under the "leader and associates" regime for roughly a quarter of the land in the Township of Hull in
Lower Canada
.
[1]
Philemon and his family arrived in the Ottawa Valley on March 7, 1800, accompanied by four other families and 33 axemen and labourers. Along with Philemon's wife Abigail and six children, the other families included his brother Thomas with his wife Mary and their children; his two sisters-in-law, Margery and Lavina, with husbands Samuel Choate and John Allen, and their children; and free Black man London Oxford with his wife and possibly also their children.
[2]
[3]
When Philemon arrived in 1800, he was accompanied by four other families and 33 axemen and labourers. Along with his wife Abigail and six children, the other families included his brother Thomas with his wife Mary and their children; his two sisters-in-law, Margery and Lavina, with husbands Samuel Choate and John Allen, and their children; and free Black man London Oxford with his wife and possibly also their children.
[2]
Thomas Wright died in the first year of the settlement but within two years, the number of associates grew to twelve: Wright's sons Philemon and Tiberius; Harvey Parker; Daniel Wyman; Ephraim and Edmond Chamberlin; Luther Colton; James and William McConnell; and Isaac Remic.
[4]
The town was originally created to support the agricultural settlement that Philemon and his brother Thomas had planned to build, but with the 1806 launching of the
Columbo
, the first square
timber raft
floated on the Ottawa River, Wright's Town became the birthplace and centre of the
Ottawa River timber trade
.
[5]
The first two farms cleared in the settlement were the Gateno Farm in 1800 and the Columbia Falls Farm in 1801, the former named after the
Gateno River
and the latter named after the Columbia Falls, the name Philemon gave to the Chaudière Falls. The Wrights used the Columbia Falls name frequently, to the point that they referred to the town as "Columbia Falls Village"; however, the name never caught on with the others,
[6]
who named the settlement Wright's Town (alternatively Wrightstown) or Wright's Village.
[7]
Contrary to popular belief, the town was never called "Wrightsville" or "Wrightville", a name originating from the later Wrightville neighbourhood of Hull.
For its first 26 years of existence, Wright's Town was the centre of commerce, industry, and agriculture in the Ottawa Valley. It was the settlement from which a majority of the other Ottawa Valley settlements grew.
[8]
The towns of
Aylmer
,
Chelsea
, and
Wakefield
in Quebec, and
Richmond
and
Bytown
in Ontario, developed and grew as a result of the influence of Wright's Town.
In 1826, when the Crown decided to build the Union Bridge (now the Chaudière Bridge) and the
Rideau Canal
, the site of Wright's Town was used as a staging ground for its construction.
[9]
Wright's Town was eventually developed into the city of
Hull, Quebec
, incorporated in 1875.
[10]
The town
[
edit
]
The whitewashed stone building in Wright's Town, seen above the Chaudière Falls, 1851
The town grew around the common, borrowing its design from the many
New England
towns where Philemon and the other first settlers grew up. The common included New England fixtures, such as a
meeting house
, a tavern, and stores. The meeting house served both political and religious functions.
[11]
[12]
The Upper Village was the site of the town's hotel, mills, foundry, bakehouse, tannery, and several shops. The Lower Village was closer to the
steamboat
wharf downriver, and it would only be laid out just before construction of the Rideau Canal, in 1826.
One of the most notable buildings in Wright's Town was a whitewashed stone building with a
cupola
, built in 1819. It was central in the Wright's Town common, and was thus prominently visible in most contemporary depictions. It appears to have had numerous owners or functions over the years, being identified as "Wright's Tavern" in 1823, the "New Stone Store" in 1824, the "Office & Store" in 1844, and as the town's meeting house by
Joseph Bouchette
,
Surveyor General
of Lower Canada.

Today
[
edit
]
Wright's Town developed into the city of Hull, Quebec, which was incorporated in 1875
[10]
and has been a sector of the city of
Gatineau
since a major amalgamation in 2002.
Nothing remains of the original 1800 settlement; the downtown Vieux-Hull sector was razed by a
destructive fire in 1900
, which also destroyed the original Union Bridge.
The name of Wright's Town was preserved in Wrightville, a neighbourhood in Hull and now modern-day Gatineau, located on the west side of Hull Island up to the Lac-des-Fées promenade.

The
DH.83 Fox Moth
was a successful small biplane passenger aircraft from the 1930s powered by a single de Havilland Gipsy Major I inline inverted engine, manufactured by the
de Havilland
Aircraft Company.
The aircraft was designed late in 1931 as a low cost and economical light passenger aircraft. Many components including the engine, tailplane, fin, rudder and wings were identical to those being used for the
de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth
then being built in large quantities as a military trainer. These were fitted to the purpose-built wooden, plywood-covered fuselage  (
longerons
: ash forward of the pilot, aft Sitka spruce). The pilot sat in a raised cockpit behind the small enclosed passenger cabin, which was usually fitted with three seats for short-range hops. The "Speed Model" was fitted with a canopy and fairing. The wings folded for space saving storage.
Operational history
[

Manchester (Ringway) Airport
in 1955
The prototype first flew on 29 January 1932, and was sent to Canada gaining sufficient interest that seven were assembled at the company's Toronto plant.
[1]
"Home" based production was shared evenly between sales within the United Kingdom and exports, with 49 aircraft each going onto the British register and being sent overseas.
[1]
British-based aircraft were mostly used on short-haul joyrides or as feeder flights around the British Isles. The DH.83 Fox Moth was the first aircraft to earn a profit in commercial airline service without subsidies.

between
Launceston, Tasmania

in October 1932. It was thus the inaugural aircraft of what was to later become
Australian National Airways
.

[2]
Total production of the DH.83/DHC.83C Fox Moth was 153, being 98 in England, two in Australia and 53 in Canada after WWII.
[3]
A number of different engines were used, including the 130 hp (97 kW) Gipsy IIIA on most British-built aircraft and the 145 hp (108 kW) Gipsy Major 1C on the 53 postwar DH.83C Canadian-built aircraft. The DHC-83Cs were fitted with larger pilot cockpit openings, a larger windscreen and canopy, a large ambulance cabin door on the port side to accommodate a stretcher, and did not have folding wings. The DH.83C used DH.82 Tiger Moth main and tail landing gear. The DH.83C was an excellent and economical bush plane.

ⓘ
) is a
country
that is part of the
United Kingdom
. It contains nearly one-third of the United Kingdom's land area, consisting of the northern third of the island of
Great Britain
and more than 790 adjacent
islands
,
[15]
principally in the archipelagos of the
Hebrides
and the
Northern Isles
. To the south-east Scotland has its
only land border
, which is 96 miles (154 kilometres) long and shared with
England
; the country is surrounded by the
Atlantic Ocean
to the north and west, the
North Sea
to the north-east and east, and the
Irish Sea
to the south. The population in 2022 was 5,436,600, and in 2019 Scotland and accounted for 8% of the population of the UK.
[16]
Edinburgh
is the capital and
Glasgow
is the largest of the
cities of Scotland
.
The
Kingdom of Scotland
emerged in the 9th century. In 1603,
James VI
inherited
England
and
Ireland
, forming a
personal union
of the
three kingdoms
. On 1 May 1707 Scotland and England combined to create the new
Kingdom of Great Britain
,
[17]
[18]
with the
Parliament of Scotland
subsumed into the
Parliament of Great Britain
. In 1999 a
Scottish Parliament
was re-established, and has
devolved
authority over many areas of
domestic policy
.
[19]
The country has a distinct
legal system
,
educational system
, and
religious history
from the rest of the UK, which have all contributed to the continuation of
Scottish culture
and
national identity
within the United Kingdom.
[20]
The mainland of Scotland is broadly divided into three regions: the
Highlands
, a mountainous region in the north and north-west; the
Lowlands
, a flatter plain across the centre of the country; and the
Southern Uplands
, a hilly region along the southern border. The Highlands are the most mountainous region of the UK and contain its highest peak,
Ben Nevis
(1,345 metres (4,413 ft)) The region also contains many lakes, called
lochs
; the term is also applied to the many saltwater inlets along the country's deeply indented western coastline. The geography of the many islands is varied. Some, such as
Mull
and
Skye
, are noted for their mountainous terrain, while the likes of
Tiree
and
Coll
are much flatter.
Etymology
Main article:
Etymology of Scotland
Scotland
comes from
Scoti
, the Latin name for the
Gaels
.
Philip Freeman
has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an
Indo-European root
, *
skot
, citing the parallel in Greek
skotos
(
σκότος
), meaning "darkness, gloom".
[21]
The
Late Latin
word
Scotia
('land of the Gaels') was initially used to refer to Ireland,
[22]
and likewise in early
Old English
Scotland
was used for Ireland.
[23]
By the 11th century at the latest,
Scotia
was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the
River Forth
, alongside
Albania
or
Albany
, both derived from the Gaelic
Alba
.
[24]
The use of the words
Scots
and
Scotland
to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the
Late Middle Ages
.

History
Main article:
History of Scotland
For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of Scottish history
.
Prehistory
Prehistoric Scotland
, before the arrival of the Roman Empire, was a complex society. Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of
human habitation
that may have existed before the
Mesolithic period
. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of
hunter-gatherers
arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the
last glaciation
.
[25]
At the time, Scotland was covered in forests, had more bog-land, and the main form of transport was by water.
[26]
: 9
These settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of
Skara Brae
on the mainland of
Orkney
dates from this period.
Neolithic
habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the
Northern Isles
and
Western Isles
, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.
[27]
Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the
Callanish Stones
on
Lewis
and the
Maes Howe
on
Orkney
, which were built in the third millennium BC.

Pytheas
, who called the northern tip of Britain "Orcas", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.
[26]
: 10
Most of modern Scotland was not
incorporated
into the
Roman Empire
, and Roman control over parts of the area fluctuated over a rather short period. The first Roman incursion into Scotland was in 79 AD, when
Agricola
invaded Scotland; he defeated a Caledonian army at the
Battle of Mons Graupius
in 83 AD.
[26]
: 12
After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the
Gask Ridge
close to the
Highland line
, but by three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the
Southern Uplands
.
[29]
Remains of Roman forts established in the 1st century have been found as far north as the
Moray Firth
.
[30]
By the reign of the
Roman emperor
Trajan
(
r.
98-117
), Roman control had lapsed to Britain south of a line between the
River Tyne
and the
Solway Firth
.
[31]
Along this line, Trajan's successor
Hadrian
(
r.
117-138
) erected
Hadrian's Wall
in northern England
[26]
: 12
and the
Limes Britannicus
became the northern border of the Roman Empire.
[32]
[33]
The Roman influence on the southern part of the country was considerable, and they introduced
Christianity
to Scotland.
[26]
: 13-14
[28]
: 38
The
Antonine Wall
was built from 142 at the order of Hadrian's successor
Antoninus Pius
(
r.
138-161
), defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island, north of a line between the
Firth of Clyde
and the
Firth of Forth
. The
Roman invasion of Caledonia 208-210
was undertaken by emperors of the imperial
Severan dynasty
in response to the breaking of a treaty by the Caledonians in 197,
[30]
but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by Roman forces becoming bogged down in punishing
guerrilla warfare
and the death of the senior emperor
Septimius Severus
(
r.
193-211
) at
Eboracum
(
York
) after he was taken ill while on campaign. Although forts erected by the
Roman army
in the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the
glens
in the Highlands, the Caledonians were again in revolt in 210-211 and these were overrun.
[30]
Callanish Stones
, erected in the late
Neolithic
era
To the Roman historians
Tacitus
and
Cassius Dio
, the
Scottish Highlands
and the area north of the
River Forth
was called
Caledonia
.
[30]
According to Cassius Dio, the inhabitants of Caledonia were the
Caledonians
and the
Maeatae
.
[30]
Other ancient authors used the adjective "Caledonian" to mean anywhere in northern or inland Britain, often mentioning the region's people and animals, its cold climate, its pearls, and a noteworthy region of wooded hills (
Latin
:
saltus
) which the 2nd century AD Roman philosopher
Ptolemy
, in his
Geography
, described as being south-west of the
Beauly Firth
.
[30]
The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of
Dunkeld
,
Rohallion
, and
Schiehallion
.
[30]
The
Great Conspiracy
constituted a seemingly coordinated invasion against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, which included the participation of the Gaelic
Scoti
and the Caledonians, who were then known as
Picts
by the Romans. This was defeated by the
comes
Theodosius
; but Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the
Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
and the immigration of the
Saxons
to southeastern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.

Political divisions in early medieval Scotland
Norse kingdoms at the end of the eleventh century
Beginning in the sixth century, the area that is now Scotland was divided into three areas:
Pictland
, a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland;
[26]
: 25-26
the
Anglo-Saxon
Kingdom of Northumbria
, which had conquered southeastern Scotland;
[26]
: 18-20
and
Dál Riata
, which included territory in western Scotland and northern Ireland, and spread Gaelic language and culture into Scotland.
[34]
These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth, although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in
subsistence agriculture
. The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.
[26]
: 26-27
Gaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of
Gaelic-speaking clerics
working as missionaries.
[26]
: 23-24
Operating in the sixth century on the island of
Iona
,
Saint Columba
was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries.
[28]
: 39
The
Vikings
began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest
Norse
settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast.
Old Norse
entirely displaced Gaelic in the
Northern Isles
.
[26]
: 29-30
In the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named
Cináed mac Ailpín
(Kenneth I) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture.
[26]
: 31-32
[35]
The kingdom of Cináed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the
Pictish language
went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic.
[26]
: 32-33
From a base in eastern Scotland north of the
River Forth
and south of the
River Spey
, the kingdom expanded first southwards, into the former Northumbrian lands, and northwards into
Moray
.
[26]
: 34-35
Around the turn of the millennium, there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established.
[26]
: 36-37
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, much of Scotland was under the control of a single ruler. Initially, Gaelic culture predominated, but immigrants from France, England and Flanders steadily created a more diverse society, with the Gaelic language starting to be replaced by Scots; and a modern nation-state emerged from this. At the end of this period, war against England started the growth of a
Scottish national consciousness
.

David I
(1124-1153) and his successors centralised royal power
[36]

and united mainland Scotland, capturing regions such as Moray,
Galloway
, and
Caithness
, although he could not extend his power over the
Hebrides
, which had been ruled by various
Scottish clans
following the death of
Somerled
in 1164.
[36]
: 48-49
The system of
feudalism
was consolidated, with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king.
[36]
: 53-54
The relationship with England was complex during this period: Scottish kings tried several times, asometimes with success, to exploit English political turmoil, followed by the longest period of peace between Scotland and England in the mediaeval period: from 1217-1296.

In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the
Auld Alliance
. War ensued, and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland.
Andrew Moray

William Wallace
initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the
Wars of Scottish Independence
,
[39]
until
Robert the Bruce
was crowned king of Scotland in 1306.
[40]
Victory at the
Battle of Bannockburn
in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the
Declaration of Arbroath
, won the support of
Pope John XXII
, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.

A civil war between the
Bruce dynasty
and their long-term rivals of the
House of Comyn
and
House of Balliol
lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce faction was successful,

In 1603,
James VI, King of Scots
inherited the thrones of the
Kingdom of England
and the
Kingdom of Ireland
in the
Union of the Crowns
, and moved to London.
[47]
This was a so called
personal union
as despite having the same monarch the kingdoms retained their own parliaments, laws and other institutions. The first
Union Jack
was designed at James's behest, to be flown in addition to the
St Andrew's Cross
on Scots vessels at sea. James VI and I intended to create a single kingdom of Great Britain, but was thwarted in his attempt to do so by the
Parliament of England
, which supported the wrecking proposal that a full legal union be sought instead, a proposal to which the Scots Parliament would not assent, causing the king to withdraw the plan.
[48]
With the exception of a short period under
the Protectorate
, Scotland remained a separate state in the 17th century, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the

In 1641 and again in 1643, the Parliament of Scotland unsuccessfully sought a union with England which was "federative" and not "incorporating", in which Scotland would retain a separate parliament.

After another proposal from the English House of Lords was rejected in 1695, and a further Lords motion was voted down in the House of Commons in 1700, the Parliament of Scotland again rejected union in 1702.
[51]
The failure of the Darien Scheme bankrupted the landowners who had invested, though not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.
[54]
[55]
On 22 July 1706, the
Treaty of Union
was agreed between representatives of the
Scots Parliament
and the
Parliament of England
. The following year, twin
Acts of Union
were passed by both parliaments to create the united
Kingdom of Great Britain
with effect from 1 May 1707
[18]
with popular opposition and anti-union riots in
Edinburgh
,
Glasgow
, and elsewhere.
[56]
[57]
The union also created the
Parliament of Great Britain
, which succeeded both the
Parliament of Scotland
and the
Parliament of England
, which rejected proposals from the
Parliament of Ireland
that the third kingdom be incorporated in the union.
[51]
With trade tariffs with England abolished, trade blossomed, especially with
Colonial America
. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow
Tobacco Lords
were the fastest ships on the route to
Virginia
. Until the
American War of Independence
in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade.
[58]
The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew, amplifying centuries of division.
The deposed
Jacobite Stuart
claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly among non-
Presbyterians
, including Roman Catholics and
Episcopalian Protestants
. Two major Jacobite risings launched in
1715
and
1745
failed to remove the
House of Hanover
from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the
Battle of Culloden
, Great Britain's last
pitched battle
.
In the Highlands, clan chiefs gradually started to think of themselves more as commercial landlords than leaders of their people. These social and economic changes included the first phase of the
Highland Clearances
and, ultimately, the demise of clanship.

— so much so
Voltaire
said "We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation."
[61]
With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent
British Empire
. Historian Neil Davidson notes "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland." Davidson also states "far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland - or more precisely, the Lowlands - lay at its core."
[62]
The
Scottish Reform Act 1832
increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes.
[63]
From the mid-century, there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of
Secretary of State for Scotland
was revived.
[64]
Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included
William Gladstone
,
[65]
and
the Earl of Rosebery
.
[66]
In the late 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by
Keir Hardie
's success in the
Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888
, leading to the foundation of the
Scottish Labour Party
, which was absorbed into the
Independent Labour Party
in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.

Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as "the

After 1860, the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre.
[69]
The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.

Walter Scott
, whose
Waverley Novels
helped define Scottish identity in the 19th century
While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,
[71]
disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists
James Clerk Maxwell
and
Lord Kelvin
, and the engineers and inventors
James Watt
and
William Murdoch
, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain.
[72]
In literature, the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was
Walter Scott
. His first prose work,
Waverley
in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.
[73]
It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.
[74]
In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as
Robert Louis Stevenson
,
Arthur Conan Doyle
,
J. M. Barrie
and
George MacDonald
.
[75]
Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The
Glasgow School
, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the
Celtic Revival
the
Arts and Crafts movement
, and
Japonism
, which found favour throughout the
modern art
world of continental Europe and helped define the
Art Nouveau
style. Proponents included architect and artist
Charles Rennie Mackintosh
.
[76]
This period saw a process of rehabilitation for Highland culture. In the 1820s, as part of the
Romantic revival
,
tartan
and the
kilt
were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe,
[77]
[78]
prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's
Ossian
cycle
[79]
[80]
and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels.
[81]
The Highlands remained poor and the only part of mainland Britain with a recurrent famine. A small range of products were exported from the region, which had negligible industrial production and a continued population growth that tested the subsistence agriculture. These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing
Highland Clearances
, in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the
Highland Potato Famine
and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.

The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.
[83]
Even with the development of industry, there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841-1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.
[84]
Caused by the advent of
refrigeration
and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.
[85]
Land prices subsequently plummeted, too, and accelerated the process of the so-called "Balmoralisation" of Scotland, an era in the second half of the 19th century that saw an increase in tourism and the establishment of large estates dedicated to
field sports
like
deer stalking
and
grouse shooting
, especially in the Scottish Highlands.
[85]
[86]
World wars and industrial modernization
A defused 1,000 kg Luftmine (German
parachute mine
) in Glasgow, 18 March 1941, during the
Clydebank Blitz
Scotland played a major role in the
British effort
in the
First World War
. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.
[87]
With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.
[88]
Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig
was Britain's commander on the Western Front.
The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called "
Red Clydeside
" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a
Liberal
stronghold, the industrial districts switched to
Labour
by 1922, with a base among the
Irish Catholic
working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. The "Reds" operated within the Labour Party with little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.
[89]
During the Second World War, Scotland was targeted by
Nazi Germany
largely due to its factories, shipyards, and coal mines.
[90]
Cities such as
Glasgow
and
Edinburgh
were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country.
[90]
Perhaps the most significant air-raid in Scotland was the
Clydebank Blitz
of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area.
[91]
528 people were killed and 4,000 homes totally destroyed.
[91]
Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when
Rudolf Hess
flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the
Duke of Hamilton
.
[92]
Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant,
Karlheinz Pintsch
, a letter addressed to
Adolf Hitler
that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May.
[93]
Albert Speer
later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal.
[94]
Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British.
Rudolf Hess
,
Deputy Führer of Nazi Germany
, crashed his plane at
Bonnyton Moor
in the Scottish central belt in an attempt to make peace.
As in World War I,
Scapa Flow
in Orkney served as an important
Royal Navy
base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and
Rosyth
gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the
Firth of Forth
and
East Lothian
.
[95]
The shipyards and heavy engineering factories in
Glasgow
and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the
Luftwaffe
, enduring great destruction and loss of life.
[96]
As transatlantic voyages involved negotiating north-west Britain, Scotland played a key part in the battle of the North Atlantic.
[97]
Shetland
's relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the
Shetland bus
by which fishing boats helped Norwegians flee the
Nazis
, and expeditions across the
North Sea
to assist resistance.
[98]
After 1945, Scotland's economic situation worsened due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.
[99]
Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance. Economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry,
electronics manufacturing
, (see
Silicon Glen
),
[100]
and the
North Sea oil
and gas industry.
[101]
The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher's government of the
Community Charge
(widely known as the Poll Tax) one year before the rest of Great Britain,
[102]
contributed to a growing movement for Scottish control over domestic affairs.
[103]
Following a
referendum on devolution proposals in 1997
, the
Scotland Act 1998
[104]
was passed by the British Parliament, which established a devolved
Scottish Parliament
and
Scottish Government
with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland.
[105]
The Scottish Parliament was reconvened in
Edinburgh
on 4 July 1999.
[106]
The first to hold the office of
first minister of Scotland
was
Donald Dewar
, who served until his sudden death in 2000.

The
Scottish Parliament Building
at Holyrood opened in October 2004 after lengthy construction delays and running over budget.
[108]
The Scottish Parliament's form of
proportional representation
(the
additional member system
) resulted in no one party having an overall majority for the first three Scottish parliament elections.
The pro-
independence
Scottish National Party
led by
Alex Salmond
achieved an overall majority in the
2011 election
, winning 69 of the 129 seats available.
[109]
The success of the SNP in achieving a majority in the Scottish Parliament paved the way for the
September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence
. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence.
[110]
More powers, particularly in relation to taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the
Smith Commission
.
Since the 2014 referendum, events such as the UK leaving the European Union, despite a majority of voters in Scotland voting to remain a member, has led to calls for a
second referendum on independence
. In 2022, the
Lord Advocate
Dorothy Bain
argued the case for the Scottish Government to hold another referendum on the issue, with the
Supreme Court
later ruling against the argument.
[111]
Following the Supreme Court decision, the Scottish Government stated that it wished to make amendments to the
Scotland Act 1998
that would allow a referendum to be held in 2023.

Geography and natural history
Main article:
Geography of Scotland
Iona
in the
Inner Hebrides
The mainland of Scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of Great Britain, which lies off the north-west coast of
Continental Europe
. The total area is 30,414 square miles (78,772 km
2
),
[113]
comparable to the size of the Czech Republic. Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for 96 miles (154 km) between the basin of the
River Tweed
on the east coast and the
Solway Firth
in the west. The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the
North Sea
is to the east. The island of Ireland lies only 13 miles (21 km) from the south-western peninsula of
Kintyre
;
[114]
Norway is 190 miles (305 km) to the east and the
Faroe Islands
, 168 miles (270 km) to the north.
The territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237
Treaty of York
between Scotland and the Kingdom of England
[115]
and the 1266
Treaty of Perth
between Scotland and Norway.
[18]
Important exceptions include the
Isle of Man
, which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a
crown dependency
outside of the United Kingdom; the island groups
Orkney
and
Shetland
, which were acquired from Norway in 1472;
[113]
and
Berwick-upon-Tweed
, lost to England in 1482
The geographical
centre of Scotland
lies a few miles from the village of
Newtonmore
in
Badenoch
.
[116]
Rising to 1,344 metres (4,409 ft) above sea level, Scotland's highest point is the summit of
Ben Nevis
, in
Lochaber
, while Scotland's longest river, the
River Tay
, flows for a distance of 118 miles (190 km).

Geology and geomorphology
Main article:
Geology of Scotland
Upper
Loch Torridon
, west coast Scotland
The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the
Pleistocene
ice ages
and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.
The
Highlands and Islands
lie to the north and west of the
Highland Boundary Fault
, which runs from
Arran
to
Stonehaven
. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the
Cambrian
and
Precambrian
, which were uplifted during the later
Caledonian orogeny
. It is interspersed with
igneous
intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the
Cairngorms
and
Skye
Cuillins
.
[

In north-eastern mainland Scotland
weathering
of rock that occurred before the
Last Ice Age
has shaped much of the landscape.
[119]
The
Scottish Highlands
, located in the north and west of Scotland
A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of
Old Red Sandstones
found principally along the
Moray Firth
coast. The
Highlands
are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups:
Shetland
,
Orkney
, and the
Inner Hebrides
and
Outer Hebrides
. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including
Loch Lomond
and
Loch Ness
. Some parts of the coastline consist of
machair
, a low-lying dune pasture land.
The
Central Lowlands
is a
rift valley
mainly comprising
Paleozoic
formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's
industrial revolution
are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism,
Arthur's Seat
in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the
Ochils
and
Campsie Fells
are rarely far from view.
The
Southern Uplands
are a range of hills almost 125 miles (200 km) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second
fault line
(the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from
Girvan
to
Dunbar
.
[120]
[121]
[122]
The geological foundations largely comprise
Silurian
deposits laid down some 400 to 500 million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is
Merrick
with an elevation of 843 m (2,766 ft).
[17]
[123]
[124]
[125]
The Southern Uplands is home to Scotland's highest village,
Wanlockhead
(430 m or 1,411 ft above sea level).

Climate
Main article:
Climate of Scotland
Tiree
in the
Inner Hebrides
is one of the sunniest locations in Scotland.
The climate of most of Scotland is
temperate
and
oceanic
, and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the
Gulf Stream
from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as
Labrador
, southern
Scandinavia
, the
Moscow region
in
Russia
, and the
Kamchatka Peninsula
on the opposite side of
Eurasia
. Temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the temperature of −27.2 °C (−17.0 °F) recorded at
Braemar
in the
Grampian Mountains
, on 11 February 1895, the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK.
[126]
Winter maxima average 6 °C (43 °F) in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging 18 °C (64 °F). The highest temperature recorded was 35.1 °C (95.2 °F) at
Floors Castle
,
Scottish Borders
on 19 July 2022.
[127]
The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic
ocean currents
and the colder surface temperatures of the
North Sea
.
Tiree
, in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975.
[128]
Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding 3,000 mm (120 in).
[129]
In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800 mm (31 in) annually.
[130]
Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average of 59 snow days per year,
[131]
while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per year.
[130]
Flora and fauna

Flora of Scotland
White-tailed sea eagle
Scotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as
gannets
.
[132]
The
golden eagle
is something of a national icon.
[133]
On the high mountain tops, species including
ptarmigan
,
mountain hare
and
stoat
can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months.
[134]
Remnants of the native
Scots pine
forest exist
[135]
and within these areas the
Scottish crossbill
, the UK's only
endemic
bird species and
vertebrate
, can be found alongside
capercaillie
,
Scottish wildcat
,
red squirrel
and
pine marten
.
[136]
[137]
[138]
Various animals have been re-introduced, including the
white-tailed eagle
in 1975, the
red kite
in the 1980s,
[139]
[140]
and there have been experimental projects involving the
beaver
and
wild boar
. Today, much of the remaining native
Caledonian Forest
lies within the
Cairngorms National Park
and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in
Argyll
, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.
[141]
[142]
The flora of the country is varied incorporating both
deciduous
and
coniferous
woodland as well as
moorland
and
tundra
species. Large-scale commercial tree planting and management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and
field sport
activities like
deer stalking
and
driven grouse shooting
impacts the distribution of
indigenous
plants and animals.
[143]
The UK's tallest tree is a
grand fir
planted beside
Loch Fyne
, Argyll in the 1870s, and the
Fortingall Yew
may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe.

cartogram
. The size of councils is in proportion to their population.
The population of Scotland at the 2022 Census was 5,436,600, the highest ever,
[10]
beating the previous record of 5,295,400 at the 2011 Census. It was 5,062,011 at the 2001 Census.
[149]
An ONS estimate for mid-2021 was 5,480,000.
[150]
In the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's population stated their
national identity
as '
Scottish
only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose 'other identity only'.
[151]
In August 2012, the Scottish population reached an all-time high of 5.25 million people.
[152]
The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.
[152]
Mid-2020 Scottish Government estimates the population of Scotland to stand at 5,470,824 inhabitants.
[153]
The
most recent census in Scotland
was conducted by the Scottish Government and the
National Records of Scotland
in March 2022.
[154]
Over the course of its history, Scotland has long had a tradition of migration from Scotland and immigration into Scotland. In 2021, the Scottish Government released figures showing that an estimated 41,000 people had immigrated from other international countries into Scotland, while an average of 22,100 people had migrated from Scotland.
[155]
Scottish Government data from 2002 shows that by 2021, there had been a sharp increase in immigration to Scotland, with 2002 estimates standing at 27,800 immigrants. While immigration had increased from 2002, migration from Scotland had dropped, with 2002 estimates standing at 26,200 people migrating from Scotland.
[156]
Urbanisation
Although
Edinburgh
is the capital of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The
Greater Glasgow
conurbation, with a population of almost 1.2 million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population.
[157]
The
Central Belt
is where most of the main towns and
cities of Scotland
are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen. The
Scottish Lowlands
host 80% of the total population, where the
Central Belt
accounts for 3.5 million people.
In general, only the more accessible and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature and dominated by agriculture and forestry.
[158]
[159]
Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh,
five new towns
were designated between 1947 and 1966. They are
East Kilbride
,
Glenrothes
,
Cumbernauld
,
Livingston
, and
Irvine
.

Languages
Scotland has three officially recognised languages: English,
Scots
, and
Scottish Gaelic
.
[162]
[163]
Scottish Standard English, a variety of English as spoken in Scotland, is at one end of a bipolar
linguistic continuum
, with broad
Scots
at the other.
[164]
Scottish Standard English may have been influenced to varying degrees by Scots.
[165]
[166]
The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had "no skills in Scots".
[167]
Others speak
Highland English
. Gaelic is mostly spoken in the
Western Isles
, where a large proportion of people still speak it. Nationally, its use is confined to 1% of the population.
[168]
The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008.
[169]
Immigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee small South Asian communities.
[170]
In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group.
[171]
Since the
enlargement of the European Union
more people from
Central
and Eastern Europe have moved to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000
Poles
live there.
[171]
[172]
There are many more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total population of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2 million Americans self-reported some degree of
Scottish
descent.
[173]
Ulster
's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent,
[174]
and it is estimated that there are more than 27 million descendants of the
Scots-Irish
migration now living in the US.
[175]
[176]
In Canada, the
Scottish-Canadian
community accounts for 4.7 million people.
[177]
About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.
[178]
Living and healthcare standards
The
total fertility rate
(TFR) in Scotland is below the replacement rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011
[179]
). The majority of births are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012
[180]
).
Life expectancy for those born in Scotland between 2012 and 2014 is 77.1 years for males and 81.1 years for females.
[181]
This is the lowest of any of the four countries of the UK.
[181]
The number of hospital admissions in Scotland for diseases such as cancer was 2,528 in 2002. Over the next ten years, by 2012, this had increased to 2,669.
[182]
Hospital admissions for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) were lower, with 727 admissions in 2002, and decreasing to 489 in 2012.
[182]
Religion
Main article:
Religion in Scotland
High Kirk of Edinburgh
Forms of
Christianity
have dominated religious life in what is now Scotland for more than 1,400 years.
[183]
[184]
In 2011 just over half (54%) of the Scottish population reported being a
Christian
while nearly 37% reported not having a religion.
[185]
Since the
Scottish Reformation
of 1560, the
national church
(the
Church of Scotland
, also known as
The Kirk
) has been
Protestant
in classification and
Reformed
in theology. Since 1689 it has had a
Presbyterian
system of church government independent from the state.
[17]
Its membership dropped just below 300,000 in 2020 (5% of the total population)
[186]
[187]
[188]
The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with every community in Scotland having a local congregation.
Scotland also has a significant
Roman Catholic
population, 19% professing that faith, particularly in Greater Glasgow and the north-west.
[189]
After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like
Uist
and
Barra
, and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland. Other Christian denominations in Scotland include the
Free Church of Scotland
, and various other Presbyterian offshoots. Scotland's third largest church is the
Scottish Episcopal Church
.
[190]
There are an estimated 75,000 Muslims in Scotland (about 1.4% of the population),
[185]
[191]
and significant but smaller
Jewish
,
Hindu
and
Sikh
communities, especially in Glasgow.
[191]
The
Samyé Ling
monastery near
Eskdalemuir
, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is the first
Buddhist
monastery in western Europe.

Education
Main article:
Education in Scotland
Founded in 1413, the
University of St. Andrews
is the oldest in Scotland and one of the oldest worldwide
The
Scottish education system
has always had a characteristic emphasis on a
broad education
.
[193]
In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the
Education Act 1496
, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn "perfyct Latyne", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite.
[194]
In the Reformation, the 1560
First Book of Discipline
set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible.
[195]
In 1616 an
act in Privy council
commanded every parish to establish a school.
[196]
By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.
[197]
Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the
Education (Scotland) Act 1872
.
[198]
Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the
Scottish Government
and is overseen by its executive agency
Education Scotland
.
[199]
The
Curriculum for Excellence
, Scotland's national school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for children and young people from age 3 to 18.
[200]
All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1-P7); children in Scotland study National Qualifications of the
Curriculum for Excellence
between the ages of 14 and 18. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study further qualifications. A small number of students at certain
private schools
may follow the
English system
and study towards
GCSEs
and
A
and
AS-Levels
instead.
[201]
There are fifteen
Scottish universities
, some of which are among the
oldest in the world
.
[202]
[203]
The four universities founded before the end of the 16th century - the
University of St Andrews
, the
University of Glasgow
, the
University of Aberdeen
and the
University of Edinburgh
- are collectively known as the
ancient universities of Scotland
, all of which rank among the 200 best universities in the world in the
THE rankings
, with Edinburgh placing in the top 50.
[204]
Scotland had more universities per capita in
QS' World University Rankings'

Health care in Scotland is mainly provided by
NHS Scotland
, Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the
National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947
(later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. Prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state-funded health care, provided by the
Highlands and Islands Medical Service
.
[209]
Healthcare policy and funding is the responsibility of the Scottish Government's
Health Directorates
.
In 2014, the NHS in Scotland had around 140,000 staff.

King Charles III
Monarch
since 2022

First Minister
since 2023
Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, a
constitutional monarchy
whose current sovereign is
Charles III
.
[211]
The monarchy uses a variety of styles, titles and other symbols specific to Scotland, most of which originated in the pre-Union
Kingdom of Scotland
. These include the
Royal Standard of Scotland
, the
royal coat of arms
, and the title
Duke of Rothesay
, which is traditionally given to the heir apparent. There are also distinct Scottish
Officers of State
and Officers of the Crown, and the
Order of the Thistle
, a
chivalric order
, is specific to the country.
[212]
The
Parliament of the United Kingdom
and the
Parliament of Scotland
are the country's primary legislative bodies. The UK Parliament is
sovereign
and therefore has supremacy over the Scottish Parliament,
[213]
but generally restricts itself to legislating over reserved matters: primarily taxes, social security, defence, international relations, and broadcasting.
[214]
There is a
convention
the UK Parliament will not legislate over devolved matters without the Scottish Parliament's consent.
[215]
Scotland is represented in the
House of Commons
, the
lower chamber
of the UK Parliament, by 59
Members of Parliament
(out of a total of 650).
[216]
They are elected to single-member
constituencies
under the
first-past-the-post
system of voting. The
Scotland Office
represents the British government in Scotland and represents Scottish interests within the government.
[217]
The Scotland Office is led by the
Secretary of State for Scotland
, who sits in the
Cabinet of the United Kingdom
.
[218]
The Conservative MP
Alister Jack
has held the position since July 2019.
[218]
Bute House
is the official residence and workplace of the first minister.
Holyrood
is the seat of the
national parliament of Scotland
.
The Scottish Parliament is a
unicameral
legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a
first-past-the-post
system, and the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the
additional member system
. MSPs normally serve for a five-year period.
[219]
The largest party since the
2021 Scottish Parliament election
, has been the
Scottish National Party
(SNP), which won 64 of the 129 seats.
[220]
The
Scottish Conservatives
,
Scottish Labour
, the
Scottish Liberal Democrats
and the
Scottish Greens
also have representation in the current Parliament.
[220]
The
next Scottish Parliament election
is due to be held on 7 May 2026.
[221]
The Scottish Government is led by the
First Minister
, who is nominated by MSPs and is typically the leader of the largest party in the Parliament. Other ministers are appointed by the first minister and serve at their discretion.
[222]
Since March 2023 the first minister has been
Humza Yousaf
, the leader of the SNP.

[224]
Nevertheless, the Scottish Government may promote Scottish interests abroad and encourage foreign investment in Scotland.
[225]
The First Minister,
Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs

[226]
and the
Minister for International Development and Europe
all have portfolios which include foreign affairs.

[230]
The Scottish Government has a network of offices in Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin, London, Ottawa, Paris, and Washington, D.C, which promote Scottish interests in their respective areas.
[231]
The nation has historic ties to France as a result of the '
Auld Alliance
', a treaty signed between the Kingdom of Scotland and
Kingdom of France
in 1295 to discourage an English invasion of either country.
[232]
The alliance effectively ended in the sixteenth century, but the two countries continue to have a close relationship, with a Statement of Intent being signed in 2013 between the Scottish Government and the
Government of France
.

Scotland also has
historical and cultural
ties with the
Scandinavian countries
.
[236]
[237]
Scottish Government policy advocates for stronger political relations with the
Nordic
and

Devolution and independence
Main articles:
Scottish devolution
and
Scottish independence
Donald Dewar
became the first
First Minister
in 1999 and chaired the
first Scottish Government
since 1707
Devolution
—the granting of central government powers to a regional government
[241]
- gained increasing popularity as a policy in the United Kingdom the late twentieth century; it was described by
John Smith
, then
Leader of the Labour Party
, as the "settled will of the Scottish people".
[242]
The Scottish Parliament and
Scottish Government
were subsequently established under the
Scotland Act 1998
; the Act followed a successful
referendum in 1997
which found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to
vary income tax
.
[243]
The Act enabled the new institutions to legislate in all areas not explicitly reserved by the UK Parliament; in practice this allows them to set most domestic policy.
[244]
Two more pieces of legislation, the Scotland Acts of
2012
and
2016
, gave the Scottish Parliament further powers to legislate on taxation and social security;
[245]
the 2016 Act also gave the Scottish Government powers to manage the affairs of the
Crown Estate in Scotland
.
[246]
The
United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020
significantly constrains the Scottish Parliament's powers in economic matters.
[250]
Its provision that goods and services lawful in one part of the UK must be accepted across the country means that standards set by the Scottish legislature would be ineffective and only create competitive disadvantages for Scottish businesses.
[247]
[251]
Academic opinion examining the act indicates that it "undermines" devolution and the parliament's autonomy.
[255]
The
2007 Scottish Parliament elections
led to the
Scottish National Party
(SNP), which supports
Scottish independence
, forming a
minority government
. The new government established a "
National Conversation
" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament,
federalism
, or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. The three main unionist opposition parties-
Scottish Labour
, the
Scottish Conservatives
, and the
Scottish Liberal Democrats
-created a separate
commission
to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies while not considering independence.
[256]
In August 2009 the SNP proposed a bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010, but was defeated by opposition from all other major parties.
[257]
[258]
[259]
The
2011 Scottish Parliament election
resulted in an SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, and on 18 September 2014 a
referendum on Scottish independence
was held.
[260]
The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%.
[261]
[262]
During the campaign, the three main parties in the British Parliament-the
Conservatives
,
Labour
, and the
Liberal Democrats
-pledged to extend the powers of the Scottish Parliament.
[263]
[264]
An all-party
commission
chaired by
Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin
was formed,
[264]
which led to the Scotland Act 2016.
[265]
Following the
European Union Referendum Act 2015
, the
2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum
was held on 23 June 2016 on Britain's membership of the
European Union
. A majority in the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU, while a majority within Scotland voted to remain a member.
[266]
The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced the following day that as a result a
new independence referendum
was "highly likely".
[267]
[266]
On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union. Because constitutional affairs are reserved matters under the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament would again have to be granted temporary additional powers under Section 30 to hold a legally binding vote.

Local government

Subdivisions of Scotland
Glasgow City Chambers
, seat of
Glasgow City Council
For
local government
purposes Scotland is subdivided into 32 single-tier council areas.
[271]
The areas were established in 1996, and their councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Decisions are made by councillors, who are elected at
local elections
every five years. The leader of the council is typically a councillor from the party with the most seats; councils also have a civic head, typically called the
provost
or
lord provost
, who represents the council on ceremonial occasions and chairs council meetings.
[272]
Community Councils
are informal organisations that represent smaller subdivisions within each council area.
[273]
Police Scotland
and the
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service
cover the entire country. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.
There are
eight cities in Scotland

[276]
Scotland had a long military tradition predating the
Treaty of Union
with England; the
Scots Army
and
Royal Scots Navy
were (with the exception of the
Atholl Highlanders
, Europe's only legal
private army
) merged with their English counterparts to form the
Royal Navy
and the
British Army
, which together form part of the
British Armed Forces
. Numerous
Scottish regiments
have at various times existed in the British Army. Distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the
Scots Guards
, the
Royal Scots Dragoon Guards
and the
154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC
, an
Army Reserve
regiment of the
Royal Logistic Corps
. In 2006, as a result of the
Delivering Security in a Changing World
white paper
, the Scottish infantry regiments in the
Scottish Division
were amalgamated to form the
Royal Regiment of Scotland
. As a result of the
Cameron-Clegg coalition
's
Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010
, the Scottish regiments of the line in the
British Army
infantry
, having previously formed the Scottish Division, were reorganised into the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division
in 2017. Before the formation of the Scottish Division, the Scottish infantry was organised into a
Lowland Brigade
and
Highland Brigade
.
Because of their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments.

Between 1960 and 1991, the
Holy Loch
was a base for the US fleet of

ballistic missile submarines
that comprise the Britain's
nuclear deterrent
.
Scotland's
Scapa Flow
was the main base for the
Royal Navy
in the 20th century.
[281]
As the
Cold War
intensified in 1961, the United States deployed
Polaris ballistic missiles
, and submarines, in the
Firth of Clyde
's
Holy Loch
. Public protests from
CND
campaigners proved futile. The Royal Navy successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened with four
Resolution
-class
Polaris submarines at the expanded
Faslane Naval Base
on the
Gare Loch
. The first patrol of a
Trident
-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War.

Law and order
Main article:
Scots law
The
High Court of Justiciary
building, Edinburgh, the supreme criminal court in Scotland
Scots law has a basis derived from
Roman law
,
[283]
combining features of both uncodified
civil law
, dating back to the
Corpus Juris Civilis
, and
common law
with
medieval sources
. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales.
[284]
Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably
Udal law
in
Orkney
and
Shetland
, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common
Celtic
or
Brehon laws
survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.
[285]
Scots law provides for three types of
courts
responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and
heraldic
. The supreme civil court is the
Court of Session
, although civil
appeals
can be taken to the
Supreme Court of the United Kingdom
(or before 1 October 2009, the
House of Lords
). The
High Court of Justiciary
is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at
Parliament House
, in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union
Parliament of Scotland
with the
High Court of Justiciary
and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the
Lawnmarket
. The
sheriff court
is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.
[286]
District courts
were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by
Justice of the Peace Courts
from 2008 to 2010. The
Court of the Lord Lyon
regulates heraldry.
For three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: "guilty", "not guilty" and "
not proven
".
[287]
Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an
acquittal
, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of
double jeopardy
. A retrial can hear new evidence at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to
pervert the course of justice
. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.

Scotland has a Western-style
open

closely linked with the rest of the UK and the wider world. Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with many large finance firms based there, including:
Lloyds Banking Group
, the
Bank of Scotland
, the Government-owned
Royal Bank of Scotland
and
Standard Life
. Edinburgh was ranked 15th in the
list of world financial centres
in 2007, but fell to 37th in 2012, following damage to its reputation,
[294]
and in 2016 was ranked 56th out of 86.
[295]
Its status had returned to 17th by 2020.
[296]
Traditionally, the Scottish economy was dominated by
heavy industry
underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and
steel industries
. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of
North Sea oil
have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more
service
-oriented economy. The
Scottish National Investment Bank
was established by the Scottish Government in 2020, which uses public money to fund commercial projects across Scotland with the hope that this seed capital will encourage further private investment, to help develop a fairer, more sustainable economy. £2 billion of taxpayers money was earmarked for the bank.
[297]
Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012.
[298]
In 2014, Scotland's per capita GDP was one of the highest in the EU.
[299]
As of April 2019 the Scottish unemployment rate was 3.3%, below the UK's overall rate of 3.8%, and the Scottish employment rate was 75.9%.
[300]
In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were estimated to be £27.5 billion.
[301]
Scotland's primary exports include
whisky
, electronics and financial services.
[302]
The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France, and Norway constitute the country's major export markets.
[302]
Whisky is one of Scotland's more known goods of economic activity. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012
[303]
and were valued at £4.3 billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports.
[304]
It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly.
[305]
It may contribute £400-682 million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.
[306]
A briefing published in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) for the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Life Long Learning Committee stated that tourism accounted for up to 5% of GDP and 7.5% of employment.
[307]
Scotland was one of the industrial powerhouses of Europe from the time of the
Industrial Revolution
onwards, being a world leader in manufacturing.
[308]
This left a legacy in the diversity of goods and services which Scotland produces, from textiles,
whisky
and
shortbread
to jet engines, buses, computer software,
investment management
and other related financial services.
[309]
In common with most other advanced industrialised economies, Scotland has seen a decline in the importance of both manufacturing industries and primary-based extractive industries. This has been combined with a rise in the
service
sector of the economy, which has grown to be the largest sector in Scotland.

Scotland has the third highest median gross salary between the
Countries of the United Kingdom
and regions at £26,007 and is higher than the overall UK average annual salary of £25,971.
[313]
With an average of £14.28, Scotland has the third highest median hourly rate (excluding overtime working hours) of any of the countries of the United Kingdom, and like the annual salary, is higher than the average UK figure as a whole.

Between 2016 and 2020, the Scottish Government estimated that 10% of people in Scotland were in persistent poverty following housing costs, with similar rates of persistent poverty for children (10%), working-age adults (10%) and pensioners (11%).
[320]
Persistent child poverty rates had seen a relatively sharp drop, however, the accuracy of this was deemed to be questionable due to a number of various factors such as households re-entering the longitudinal sample allowing data gaps to be filled.
[320]
The Scottish Government introduced the Scottish Child Payment in 2021 for low income families with children under six years of age in an attempt to reduce child poverty rates, with families receiving a payment of roughly £1,040 per year.
[321]
As of October 2023, 10% of the Scottish population were estimated to be living in poverty.

Scotland's primary sources for energy are provided through renewable energy (61.8%), nuclear (25.7%) and fossil fuel generation (10.9%).
[325]
In Scotland, 98.6% of all electricity used was from renewable sources. This is minus net exports.
[325]
Between October 2021 and September 2022 63.1% of all electricity generated in Scotland was from renewable sources, 83.6% was classed as low carbon and 14.5% was from fossil fuels.
[326]
The Scottish Government has a target to have the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland's heat, transport and electricity consumption to be supplied from renewable sources by 2030.

, regarded as the national poet of Scotland is a well known and respected poet worldwide (left). The
bagpipes
are a well-known symbol of Scotland and an early example of popular Scottish music (right).
Scottish music
is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the
Great Highland bagpipe
, a woodwind reed instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. The popularity of
pipe bands
—primarily featuring bagpipes, various types of snares and drums, and showcasing Scottish traditional dress and music—has spread throughout the world. Bagpipes are featured in holiday celebrations, parades, funerals, weddings, and other events internationally. Many military regiments have a pipe band of their own. In addition to the Great Highland pipes, several smaller, somewhat quieter
bellows
-blown varieties of bagpipe are played in Scotland, including the
smallpipes
and the
Border pipes
.
Scottish popular music
has gained an international following, with artists such as
Lewis Capaldi
,
Amy Macdonald
,
KT Tunstall
,
Nina Nesbitt
,
Chvrches
,
Gerry Cinnamon
and
Paolo Nutini
gaining international success. DJ
Calvin Harris
was one of the
most streamed artists on Spotify
in 2023.

Musical talent in Scotland is recognised via the
Scottish Music Awards
,
Scottish Album of the Year Award
, the
Scots Trad Music Awards
and the
BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician

Scotland has a literary heritage dating back to the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in
Brythonic
speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of
Welsh literature
.
[337]
Later medieval literature included works in Latin,
[338]
Gaelic,
[339]
Old English
[340]
and French.
[341]
The first surviving major text in
Early Scots
is the 14th-century poet
John Barbour
's epic
Brus
, focusing on the life of Robert I,
[342]
and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works.
[343]
In the 16th century, the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry,
[344]
but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as a literary language.
[345]
Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including
James Macpherson
, whose
Ossian Cycle
made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment.
[346]
It was also a major influence on
Robert Burns
, whom many consider the national poet,
[347]
and
Walter Scott
, whose
Waverley Novels
did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century.
[348]
Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including
Robert Louis Stevenson
,
Arthur Conan Doyle
,
J. M. Barrie
and
George MacDonald
.
[349]
In the 20th century the
Scottish Renaissance
saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature.
[350]
Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including
Edwin Morgan
, who would be appointed the first
Scots Makar
by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004.
[351]
From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including
Irvine Welsh
.
[350]
Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included
Carol Ann Duffy
, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named the monarch's
Poet Laureate
.
[352]
National newspapers such as the
Daily Record
,
The Herald
,
The Scotsman
and
The National
are all produced in Scotland.
[353]
Important regional dailies include the
Evening News
in Edinburgh,
The Courier
in Dundee in the east, and
The Press and Journal
serving Aberdeen and the north.
[353]
Scotland is represented at the
Celtic Media Festival
, which showcases film and television from the Celtic countries. Scottish entrants have won many awards since the festival began in 1980.
[354]
Scotland's national broadcaster is
BBC Scotland
, a division of the
BBC
, which runs three national
television stations
BBC One Scotland
,
BBC Scotland channel
and the Gaelic-language broadcaster
BBC Alba
, and the national radio stations,
BBC Radio Scotland
and
BBC Radio nan Gàidheal
, among others. The main Scottish commercial television station is
STV
which broadcasts on two of the three
ITV
regions of Scotland.

Celtic connections
Further information:
Celtic nations
As one of the
Celtic nations
, Scotland and Scottish culture are represented at inter-Celtic events at home and over the world. Scotland hosts several music festivals including
Celtic Connections
(Glasgow), and the
Hebridean Celtic Festival
(Stornoway). Festivals celebrating Celtic culture, such as
Festival Interceltique de Lorient
(
Brittany
), the
Pan Celtic Festival
(Ireland), and the National Celtic Festival (
Portarlington
, Australia), feature elements of Scottish culture such as language, music and dance.

National identity

Scottish people
and
National symbols of Scotland
The
Royal Arms of Scotland
The
spear thistle
, the
national emblem
of Scotland
The image of
St. Andrew
, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the
Kingdom of Scotland
during the reign of
William I
.
[360]
Following the death of
King Alexander III
in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the
seal
of the
Guardians of Scotland
who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent
interregnum
.
[361]
Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the
saltire
, has its origins in the late 14th century; the
Parliament of Scotland
decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics.
[362]
Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century.
[363]
Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the
Union Flag
. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the
thistle
, the nation's
floral emblem
(celebrated in the song,
The Thistle o' Scotland
), the
Declaration of Arbroath
, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern
tartan
that often signifies a particular
Scottish clan
and the royal
Lion Rampant
flag.
[364]
[365]
[366]
Highlanders can thank
James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose
, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.
[367]
Although there is no official
national anthem of Scotland
,
[368]
Flower of Scotland
is played on special occasions and sporting events such as football and rugby matches involving the Scotland national teams and since 2010 is also played at the Commonwealth Games after it was voted the overwhelming favourite by participating Scottish athletes.
[369]
Other currently less popular candidates for the National Anthem of Scotland include
Scotland the Brave
,
Highland Cathedral
,
Scots Wha Hae
and
A Man's A Man for A' That
.
[370]
St Andrew's Day
, 30 November, is the
national day
, although
Burns' Night
tends to be more widely observed, particularly outside Scotland. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the
St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007
, designating the day an official
bank holiday
.
[371]
Tartan Day
is a recent innovation from Canada.
[372]
The national animal of Scotland is the
unicorn
, which has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.
[373]
Cuisine
Main article:
Scottish cuisine

Scottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider
British
and
European cuisine
as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of
game
, dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of
spices
from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive.
Irn-Bru
is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as "Scotland's other national drink" (after whisky).
[374]
During the
Late Middle Ages
and
early modern era
,
French cuisine
played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the "
Auld Alliance
",
[375]
especially during the reign of
Mary, Queen of Scots
. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.

First edition
I'm Not Stiller
(German title:
Stiller
) is a novel by Swiss author
Max Frisch
, which was published in 1954.  The theme of the novel, the question of identity, is a recurring theme in the work of Frisch.
The narrator, travelling on an American passport in the name of James Larkin White, is arrested on arrival in Switzerland. He is accused of being the missing Swiss sculptor Anatol Ludwig Stiller, an accusation which White persistently denies. 
Friends and acquaintances visit and identify him as Stiller. Stiller's wife Julika Stiller-Tschudy, a former ballet dancer who now runs a dance school, travels from Paris to visit him in prison.  She, too, identifies him as Stiller. Over the course of the novel, the complex histories of Stiller and White are revealed.
It was translated into English by
Michael Bullock
and published in an abridged version by Abelard-Schuman in 1958, and later as an unabridged edition by Methuen in 1982.

Huntingdon and Peterborough
was a short-lived
administrative
and
geographical county
in
East Anglia
in the
United Kingdom
. It existed from 1965 to 1974, when it became part of
Cambridgeshire
.
Formation
[
edit
]
The
Local Government Act 1888
created four small neighbouring administrative counties in the east of England: Cambridgeshire,
Isle of Ely
,
Huntingdonshire
and the
Soke of Peterborough
. Following the
Second World War
, a
Local Government Boundary Commission
was formed to review county-level administration in England and Wales. The commission was of the opinion that counties needed to have a population of between 200,000 and one million in order to provide effective services. Accordingly, they recommended the amalgamation of all four counties into a single entity.
[1]
[2]
The commission's recommendations were not carried out, however.
The reform of local government was returned to in 1958, with the appointment of a
Local Government Commission for England
. The four counties were included in the East Midlands General Review Area, and the LGCE made its draft proposals in 1960. The commission identified particular problems in the administration of the Soke of Peterborough, where 80% of the population of the county lay within the City of Peterborough, which was itself seeking
county borough
status. The LGCE concluded that the Soke was too small to continue as a separate county, and needed to become part of a larger authority. Accordingly, the draft proposals were to combine the Isle of Ely, Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough with Cambridgeshire (less the City of Cambridge).
[3]
There was considerable opposition to the draft proposals, and the LGCE instead opted in its final report in 1961 to create two counties:
Huntingdon
and Peterborough, and
Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely
. The Huntingdon and Peterborough Order was made on 14 February 1964, and placed before the
House of Commons
on 9 March 1964. The amalgamation was welcomed by
David Renton
, the
member of parliament
(MP) for
Huntingdonshire
, who felt that "The new county will have very good communications and a great community of interest. It will be a compact and convenient local government unit." The order was approved by 143 votes to 83.
[3]
The new county was formed on 1 April 1965 from the areas of the administrative counties of Huntingdonshire and Soke of Peterborough (with minor boundary changes) and
Thorney Rural District
from the
Isle of Ely
. As well as becoming an administrative county, Huntingdon and Peterborough also became a county for other statutory purposes. Accordingly, the
Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire
became
Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdon and Peterborough
, with Peterborough ceasing to be part of the geographical county of Northamptonshire. A
high sheriff
was also appointed to the new county, and a single commission of peace and court of quarter sessions established.
[3]
[4]
The county's population, as recorded at the ten-yearly census, was 202,622 in 1971.
[5]
Emergency services
[
edit
]
On the creation of the county an order under the
Police Act 1964
came into force creating the
Mid-Anglia Constabulary
by merging the Cambridge City Police, Cambridgeshire County Constabulary, Isle of Ely Constabulary, Huntingdonshire Constabulary, and the
Peterborough Combined Police
Force (created in 1947 from the
Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary
and the
Peterborough City Police
). On further local government reform in 1974, the present
Cambridgeshire Constabulary
was formed with the same boundaries.
[6]
The Huntingdon and Peterborough Fire Brigade was formed on the same date by the merger of Huntingdonshire Fire Brigade and the Soke of Peterborough Fire Brigade. Since 1974 this has formed part of
Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service
.
Districts
[
edit
]
The county was divided into thirteen local government districts: three
municipal boroughs
, three
urban districts
and seven
rural districts
. Each of these existed as subdivisions of the predecessor counties.

Coat of arms
[
edit
]
Huntingdon and Peterborough County Council was granted
armorial bearings
by the
College of Arms
on 3 April 1965. The blazon was as follows:
Barry argent and azure on a fess embattled vert a cornucopia between two garbs or; and for a crest issuant from a mural crown or a demi lion gules gorged with a collar flory counterflory and supporting a staff or, flying therefrom a banner vert charged with two keys in saltire or; mantled azure, doubled argent. And for supporters on the dexter side a pikeman of the
New Model Army
supporting with the exterior hand a pike, and on the sinister side a nitred abbot in processional vestments for st Peter's Day supporting with the exterior hand a crosier and sudarium all proper. Badge: Two keys in saltire surmounted by a buglehorn or the strings azure interlaced with the keys.
[8]
The arms and crest were a combination of the arms previously used by Huntingdonshire and Soke of Peterborough County Councils. To these were added
supporters
: a pikeman of the New Model Army for the
Cromwellian
associations of Huntingdonshire, and a
mitred abbot
for the origins of the Soke as territory administered by
Peterborough Abbey
.
[9]
The
Latin
motto
adopted by the council
Cor Unum
, or
One Heart
, was formerly that of the Soke.
Abolition
[
edit
]
The county only had a nine-year existence. In 1974 the
Local Government Act 1972
completely reformed administrative structures throughout England and Wales excluding
Greater London
. A system of
metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties
, each divided into districts was introduced.  Huntingdon and Peterborough was merged with neighbouring Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely to form the new enlarged
non-metropolitan county
(and
lieutenancy
) of Cambridgeshire, first proposed in 1947.
Peterborough
and
Huntingdon
became two of the county's six districts and in 1984, following a resolution of the council, the latter district was renamed Huntingdonshire.
[10]
Legacy
[
edit
]
There is now a
Hunts & Peterborough County Rugby Union
that takes all the teams from each area and has representative teams for Youth rugby.

In Camera
is the fourth solo album from the English singer-songwriter
Peter Hammill
. It was released in July 1974.
Much of the material was recorded in Hammill's home studio on simple four-track equipment. He then took the tapes to
Trident Studios
, where additional elements such as drumming from
Van der Graaf Generator
colleague Guy Evans, and layers of
ARP 2600
analogue synthesizer were added. The album has a predominantly dark, gothic, claustrophobic feel, with the lyrics laced with apocalyptic, religious and existential imagery. "Gog" is a particularly intense and demonic song, featuring (even by Hammill's standards) strident and aggressive vocals, grandiose harmonium chords, and powerful drumming. This segués into "Magog", which is virtually a
musique concrète
piece of sinister drones, percussive noises, and including a ring modulated spoken vocal. Songs such as "Ferret and Featherbird" and "Again" are gentler offerings, and Hammill refers to the first as "something approaching a 'sweet' song".
[2]
The album was dedicated to Hammill's brother, Andrew.
"Again" was re-worked for Hammill's 1984 album
The Love Songs
.

The
2017-18 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round
began on 29 June and ended on 24 August 2017.
[1]
A total of 156 teams competed in the qualifying phase and play-off round to decide 22 of the 48 places in the
group stage
of the
2017-18 UEFA Europa League
.
[2]
All times were
CEST
(
UTC+2
).
Round and draw dates
[
edit
]
The schedule of the qualifying phase and play-off round was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in
Nyon
, Switzerland).

Matches may also be played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts.
Format
[
edit
]
In the qualifying phase and play-off round, each tie was played over
two legs
, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the
away goals rule
was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of
extra time
was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by
penalty shoot-out
.
[2]
In the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their
UEFA club coefficients
at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided by draw. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association (or associations with political conflicts) were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.
Teams
[
edit
]
A total of 156 teams were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round, including the 15 losers of the
third qualifying round
(10 in
Champions Route
, 5 in
League Route
) which entered the play-off round. The 22 winners of the play-off round advanced to the
group stage
to join the 16 teams which entered in the group stage and the 10 losers of the
Champions League play-off round
(5 in
Champions Route
, 5 in
League Route
).

Second qualifying round
[
edit
]
The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 19 June 2017, 14:30
CEST
(after the completion of the first qualifying round draw).
[5]
Seeding
[
edit
]
A total of 66 teams played in the second qualifying round: 16 teams which entered in this round, and the 50 winners of the first qualifying round. Prior to the draw the participating teams were placed in six groups with five seeded and five unseeded teams (groups 1-3) or six seeded and six unseeded teams (groups 4-6), depending on their UEFA club coefficient. (Note: The numbers for each team were pre-assigned by UEFA so that the draw could be held in one run for the groups with ten teams and another run for the groups with twelve teams.) Since the draw for the second qualifying round took place before the results of the previous round were known, the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie would advance to this round, which meant if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent.

Third qualifying round

The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 14 July 2017, 13:00

.

Seeding
[
edit
]
A total of 58 teams played in the third qualifying round: 25 teams which entered in this round, and the 33 winners of the second qualifying round. Prior to the draw the participating teams were placed in one group with five seeded and five unseeded teams (group 1) and four groups with six seeded and six unseeded teams (groups 2-5), depending on their UEFA club coefficient. (Note: The numbers for each team were pre-assigned by UEFA so that the draw could be held in one run for the group with ten teams and another run for the groups with twelve teams.) Since the draw for the third qualifying round took place before the results of the previous round were known, the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie would advance to this round, which meant if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent.

DSM
(31 December 1888 − 10 February 1946) (middle name also recorded as
James
) was a
Royal Navy
(RN) sailor and an
English
recipient of the
Victoria Cross
(VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to
British
and
Commonwealth
forces.
Naval career
[
edit
]
During the
First World War
Pitcher served in
Q ships
commanded by Commander
Gordon Campbell
. The first was
HMS
Farnborough
(Q.5) which sank two
U-boats
but was herself sunk by the second; Captain Campbell
[1]
was awarded the VC after the second action. Most of the crew, including Pitcher, were rescued and followed Campbell to
HMS
Pargust
.
Pargust
sank the U-boat
UC-29
but was herself severely damaged. The Admiralty decided that
Pargust'
s action was worthy of the VC but that all of the crew had acted with equal valour, so article 13 of the VC's royal warrant was applied and the ship's company voted for one commissioned officer and one petty officer or seaman to receive the award: these were
Pargust
's
first lieutenant,
Ronald Stuart
, and seaman
William Williams
. Pitcher received the Distinguished Service Medal.
[2]
Campbell and the crew then transferred to
HMS
Dunraven
, in which the action took place for which Pitcher was awarded the VC.
On the 8th August, 1917, H.M.S. "Dunraven," under the command of Captain Gordon Campbell, V.C., D.S.O., R.N., sighted an enemy submarine
[
UC-71
]
on the horizon. In her role of armed British merchant ship, the "Dunraven" continued her zig-zag course, whereupon the submarine closed, remaining submerged to within 5,000 yards, and then, rising to the surface, opened fire. The "Dunraven" returned the fire with her merchant ship gun, at the same time reducing speed to enable the enemy to overtake her. Wireless signals were also sent out for the benefit of the submarine: "Help! come quickly - submarine chasing and shelling me." Finally, when the shells began falling close, the "Dunraven" stopped and abandoned ship by the "panic party."
[The "panic party" was a small number of men who were to "abandon ship" during an attack to continue the impersonation of a merchant ship.]
The ship was then being heavily shelled, and on fire aft. In the meantime the submarine closed to 400 yards distant, partly obscured from view by the dense clouds of smoke issuing1 from the "Dunraven's" stern. Despite the knowledge that the after magazine must inevitably explode if he waited, and further, that a gun and gun's crew lay concealed over the magazine, Captain Campbell decided to reserve his fire until the submarine had passed clear of the smoke. A moment later, however, a heavy explosion occurred aft, blowing the gun and gun's crew into the air, and accidentally starting the fire-gongs at the remaining gun positions; screens were immediately dropped, and the only gun that would bear opened fire, but the submarine, apparently frightened by the explosion, had already commenced to submerge. Realising that a torpedo must inevitably follow, Captain Campbell ordered the surgeon to remove all wounded and conceal them in cabins; hoses were also turned on the poop, which was a mass of flames. A signal was sent out warning men-of-war to divert all traffic below the horizon in order that nothing should interrupt the final phase of the action. Twenty minutes later a torpedo again struck the ship abaft the engine-room. An additional party of men were again sent away as a "panic party," and left the ship to outward appearances completely abandoned, with the White Ensign flying and guns unmasked. For the succeeding fifty minutes the submarine examined the ship through her periscope. During this period boxes of cordite and shells exploded every few minutes, and the fire on the poop still blazed furiously. Captain Campbell and the handful of officers and men who remained on board lay hidden during this ordeal. The submarine then rose to the surface astern, where no guns could bear and shelled the ship closely for twenty minutes. The enemy then submerged and steamed past the ship 150 yards off, examining her through the periscope. Captain Campbell decided then to fire one of his torpedoes, but missed by a few inches. The submarine crossed the bows and came slowly down the other side, whereupon a second torpedo was fired and missed again. The enemy observed it and immediately submerged. Urgent signals for assistance were immediately sent out, but pending arrival of assistance Captain Campbell arranged for a third "panic party" to jump overboard if necessary and leave one gun's crew on board for a final attempt to destroy the enemy, should he again attack. Almost immediately afterwards, however, British and American destroyers arrived on the scene, the wounded were transferred, boats were recalled and the fire extinguished. The "Dunraven" although her stern was awash, was taken in tow, but the weather grew worse, and early the following morning she sank with colours flying.
[3]
Petty Officer Pitcher was captain of the 4-inch gun crew. When the magazine below them blew up the crew were blown into the air, but Pitcher and another man landed on mock railway trucks made of wood and canvas, which cushioned their falls and saved their lives. His VC was awarded by ballot of the gun crew.
[4]
Lieutenant
Charles George Bonner
was also awarded the VC. Pitcher also received the
Croix de Guerre
[5]
and the
Médaille Militaire
.
[6]
Interbellum and later life
[
edit
]
In 1920 Pitcher was promoted to
chief petty officer
. In 1927 he retired from the Royal Navy and lived in
Dorset
, where he taught woodwork in a boys' school in
Swanage
and also ran a pub, the "Royal Oak" in
Herston
. On the outbreak of the
Second World War
he rejoined the Navy and served onshore in the south of England. After the war his health deteriorated and he died of tuberculosis on 10 February 1946. His body was brought back to Swanage, where he is buried in Northbrook Cemetery.

The
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
(
CSIR
) is
South Africa
's central and premier scientific research and development organisation. It was established by an act of
parliament
in 1945 and is situated on its own campus in the city of
Pretoria
.
[3]
It is the largest research and development (R&D) organisation in Africa and accounts for about 10% of the entire African R&D budget. It has a staff of approximately 3,000 technical and scientific researchers, often working in multi-disciplinary teams.
CSIR contract research and development
[
edit
]
Overview
[
edit
]
The CSIR contract R&D portfolio aims to enable clear understanding of national imperatives and the needs of industry to optimise the impact of the CSIR's R&D outputs. It leverages public, private and international partnerships in support of cutting-edge science, engineering and technology (SET).The organisation has clients in both the private sector (micro, small, medium and large enterprises; formal and informal), as well as in the public sector (national, provincial and local government). The organisation also deals with public enterprises and institutions, national safety and security establishments, and development structures. Regionally and abroad, the CSIR fosters partnerships and a network of clients and partner organisations as part of a global sphere of influence on matters of technology. The CSIR liaises closely with tertiary education institutions. With a strong emphasis on relevant and developmental work, it also has strong roots in various communities, and collaborates with a wide range of donors and funding agencies. The CSIR aims to contribute to the national programme of development, perform relevant knowledge generating research and transferring technology and skilled human capital, and strengthen the science and technology base. The Frascati Manual defines R&D as creative work undertaken systematically to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications. At the CSIR, the research, development and innovation (RDI) chain encompasses, what we term, types A, B and C research:
Type A refers to directed basic or applied research that explores the underlying nature of a system
Type B talks to experimental development that typically results in a new prototype, which captures new knowledge into a product, service or policy
Type C is technology transfer, the first step of knowledge application.
The CSIR operates with two kinds of R&D income, each with its own purpose. The Parliamentary Grant is used for strengthening the CSIR's S&T base - knowledge, people and infrastructure. Secondly, Contract R&D income is derived from performing contract research for clients in the public and private sectors, locally and abroad, on specific programmes, initiatives and projects. All R&D work contributes to the
National System of Innovation
(NSI).

Southern Education and Research Alliance
In 1999 a strategic alliance was formed between the
University of Pretoria
and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
[5]
This alliance, which is known as the
Southern Education and Research Alliance
(SERA), collaborates locally and internationally with universities, NGO's, companies and multinational bodies in various research areas.

Controversy
[
edit
]
In July 2016 the
amaBhungane
Centre for Investigative Journalism published an article that alleges that South Africa's Science and Technology Minister
Naledi Pandor
and Director-General
Phil Mjwara
were attempting to put undue pressure the CSIR, at the behest of The corrupt ANC treasurer-general
Zweli Mkhize
, to favour the Chinese multinational
Huawei Technologies
in the purchase of a new R116-million (equivalent to around US$8 million) super computer for the institute.  This followed the publication of the council's long time CEO, Sibusiso Sibisi's, open letter of resignation stating that irregularities and political pressure on the awarding of contracts to suppliers was of great concern.
[7]
In a well-known case of
biopiracy
,
bioprospectors
from  South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research realized that
Hoodia
was marketable (after a marketing campaign falsely claiming that it was an
appetite suppressant
for weight loss) and patented its use as an appetite suppressant without recognizing the
San people
's traditional claims to the knowledge of the plant and its uses.
[8]
The patent was later sold to
Unilever
, which marketed hoodia products as diet supplements.
[9]
[10]
[11]
In 2003, the South African San Council made an agreement with CSIR in which they would receive from 6 to 8% of the revenue from the sale of
Ho. gordonii
products, money which would be deposited in a fund to purchase land for the San people who had been dispossessed from their lands by migrating tribes.

Le Héros
was a
French Navy
Redoutable
-class
submarine
of the M6 series
commissioned
in 1934. She participated in
World War II
on the side of the
Allies
until June 1940, and then in the naval forces of
Vichy France
until she was sunk in 1942.
Characteristics
[
edit
]
Profile of
Casabianca
,
sister ship
of
Le Héros
.
Le Héros
was part of a fairly homogeneous series of 31 deep-sea patrol
submarines
also called "1,500-tonners" because of their
displacement
. All entered service between 1931 and 1939.
The
Redoutable
-class submarines were 92.3 metres (302 ft 10 in) long and 8.1 metres (26 ft 7 in) in
beam
and had a
draft
of 4.4 metres (14 ft 5 in). They could dive to a depth of 80 metres (262 ft). They displaced 1,572 tonnes (1,547 long tons) on the surface and 2,082 tonnes (2,049 long tons) underwater. Propelled on the surface by two
diesel engines
producing a combined 6,000 horsepower (4,474 kW), they had a maximum speed of 18.6 knots (34.4 km/h; 21.4 mph). When submerged, their two
electric motors
produced a combined 2,250 horsepower (1,678 kW) and allowed them to reach 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). Also called "deep-cruising submarines", their range on the surface was 10,000 nautical miles (19,000 km; 12,000 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). Underwater, they could travel 100 nautical miles (190 km; 120 mi) at 5 knots (9.3 km/h; 5.8 mph).

When
World War II
began in September 1939,
Le Héros
was assigned to the 1st Submarine
Division
based at
Toulon
, France.
[2]
[4]
[5]
Her sister ships
Le Conquérant
,
Le Glorieux
, and
Le Tonnant
made up the rest of the division.
[2]
[4]
[5]
In December 1939,
Le Héros
was sent in search of the
German
tanker
Altmark
in the mid-
Atlantic Ocean
with her sister ships
Achéron
,
Agosta
,
Bévéziers
,
Fresnel
, and
Redoutable
.
[2]
[4]
[6]
From 8 to 29 March 1940, she carried out a patrol in the South
Atlantic Ocean
between
Fernando de Noronha
and the coast of
Brazil
, without success.
[4]
[7]
In April 1940, the rest of the 1st Submarine Division was transferred to
Bizerte
in
Tunisia
, but
Le Héros
and
Le Glorieux
were based at
Dakar
in
Senegal
.
German ground forces advanced into France on 10 May 1940, beginning the
Battle of France
, and
Italy
declared war on France on 10 June 1940 and
joined the invasion
. The Battle of France ended in France's defeat and
armistice
with Germany and Italy, which went into effect on 25 June 1940.
Le Héros
was still assigned to the 1st Submarine Division that day,
home-ported
at Toulon but apparently stationed at Dakar.
[4]
[note 1]
Vichy France
[
edit
]
After France's surrender,
Le Héros
served in the naval forces of
Vichy France
. apparently stationed initially at Dakar.
[note 1]
After the
attack on Mers-el-Kébir
— in which a British
Royal Navy
squadron attacked a French Navy squadron moored at the naval base at
Mers El Kébir
in
Oran
on the coast of
Algeria
on 3 July 1940 —
Le Héros
and
Le Glorieux
got underway from Dakar at 04:30 on 4 July 1940 in company with a
Latécoère 302
flying boat
to retaliate by attacking the British
heavy cruiser
HMS
Dorsetshire
, which was patrolling south of Dakar.
[4]
The flying boat found
Dorsetshire
and guided the submarines to her,
[2]
but the submarines could get no closer to her than 6,000 metres (6,600 yd).
[4]
They received orders at 16:00 to return to Dakar.
[4]
During their return voyage, a
seaplane
from
Dorsetshre
attacked them,
[4]
narrowly missing
Le Glorieux
with two
bombs
.
[8]
On 7 July 1940, a British naval force arrived off Dakar and, as a part of
Operation Catapult
, transmitted an ultimatum at 18:00.
[4]
The French did not reply, and ordered
Le Héros
and
Le Glorieux
to put to sea.
[4]
Many members of their crews initially refused to fight the British, but the
commanding officer
of
Le Héros
convinced them to participate in the
sortie
.
[4]
The two submarines got underway to conduct the attack, but sources differ on the details of what followed.
[4]
According to one account, they left Dakar together and anchored southeast of the island of
Gorée
at 21:30 on 7 July,
[4]
then set off to attack the British squadron on 8 July 1940, a French
sloop-of-war
mistakenly opening fire on them as they departed,
[4]
and submerged off Dakar at 11:20.
[4]
In another version of the events,
Le Héros
was still moored in Dakar on 8 July and got underway at dawn that day,
[4]
while
Le Glorieux
departed a few hours later;
[4]
mistaken for a British submarine attempting to infiltrate the harbor,
Le Glorieux
suffered some light damage when she came under heavy gunfire from three French ships and was bombed by a French seaplane.
[4]
In either event, both submarines spent the day submerged off Dakar
[4]
and attempted to attack the British ships there but could not get close enough, and the British departed the area and headed for Freetown after
Fleet Air Arm
Fairey Swordfish
torpedo bombers
from the
aircraft carrier
HMS
Hermes
attacked and seriously damaged the French
battleship
Richelieu
at Dakar that day.
[4]
[9]
Both submarines returned to Dakar during the night of 8-9 July 1940.
[4]
By 8 August 1940,
Le Héros
and
Le Glorieux
were at
Casablanca
in
French Morocco
,
[4]
From 5 to 7 November 1940,
Le Héros
and her sister ship
Vengeur
operated south of
Cabo de Gata
,
Spain
, to reconnoiter
Gibraltar
.
[4]
[10]
Le Héros
and
Le Glorieux
later proceeded to Toulon, where they were placed under guard and maintained in a disarmed and unfueled status under the terms of the 1940 armistice. On 1 June 1941 they began training for a deployment to Dakar and from there to
Madagascar
in the
Indian Ocean
.
[4]
[11]
They departed Toulon on 28 September 1941 and, after stops at Oran from 1 to 3 October and Casablanca from 5 to 7 October, arrived on 12 October 1941 at Dakar, where they both entered drydock from 15 to 19 October 1941 for
hull
cleaning.
[8]
In October 1941, the British boarded and captured a
convoy
of four Vichy French cargo ships en route to Dakar.
[2]
[4]
To retaliate, the French ordered
Le Glorieux
and
Le Héros
to attack British trade routes along the coast of
South Africa
.
[2]
[4]
The two submarines got underway from Dakar in company with a convoy on 27 October 1941 to continue their journey to Madagascar.
[8]
[note 2]
On either 15 or 16 November 1941, according to different sources,
[8]
one of the submarines attacked the 4,000-
gross register ton
cargo ship
Capo Olmo
, some sources claiming that
Le Glorieux
fired two
torpedoes
at her south of the
Cape of Good Hope
off
Port Elizabeth
, South Africa, at
and that both missed,
[8]
[12]
others that
Le Héros
made the attack during a storm on 16 November 1940 and claimed to have sunk
Capo Olmo
.
[2]
[4]
At 04:29 on 17 November 1941,
Le Héros
torpedoed the 5,750- or 5,757-
[3]
gross register ton
(according to different sources) cargo ship
Thode Fagelund
in the
Indian Ocean
off
East London
, South Africa, at
.
[4]
[3]
[12]
Thode Fagelund
sank at 04:42,
[4]
but her entire crew survived.
[3]
Le Héros
attempted an attack on another
merchant ship
during the evening of 17 November, but without success.
[2]
Le Héros
and
Le Glorieux
rendezvoused off
Fort-Dauphin
on the southern coast of Madagascar on 23 November 1941
[4]
[8]
and proceeded to
Diego-Suarez
, Madagascar, which they reached in poor condition on 27 November 1941 after a journey of 7,000 nautical miles (13,000 km; 8,060 mi).
[8]
On 8 February 1942,
Le Héros
departed Diego-Suarez to escort the
auxiliary cruiser
Bougainville
, which was loaded with 1,200 tonnes (1,180 long tons; 1,320 short tons) of food, to resupply
Djibouti
in
French Somaliland
,
[2]
[4]
which was under a British
blockade
.
[2]
After arriving at Djibouti,
Le Héros
conducted a patrol in the
Gulf of Tadjoura
off French Somaliland from 27 February to 2 March 1942.
[2]
[4]
She got underway from Djibouti on 17 March 1942 to return to Madagascar and arrived at Diego-Suarez on 27 March 1942.
[2]
[4]
On 2 May 1942,
Le Héros
departed Diego-Suarez to escort another cargo ship carrying supplies to Djibouti.
[2]
[4]
Fearing a
Japanese
attack on Madagascar, which would compromise
India
's security and supplies, the British
invaded Madagascar
, beginning with
amphibious landings
in
Courrier Bay
near Diego-Suarez at dawn on 5 May 1942.
[2]
[4]
[13]
In the
Indian Ocean
500 nautical miles (926 km; 575 mi) north of Madagascar at the time,
Le Héros
accompanied the cargo ship she was escorting as it altered course to steer for the
Comoro Islands
.
[2]
After seeing the ship safely to the Comoros,
Le Héros
made for Diego-Suarez on the surface at 17 knots (31 km/h; 20 mph).
[2]
[4]
Throughout the afternoon of 5 May, she received more and more alarming reports from Madagascar about British progress in the invasion.
[4]
She was still 250 nautical miles (463 km; 288 mi) from Diego-Suarez when a British aircraft forced her to dive at 15:00 on 6 May 1942.
[2]
[4]
By the time she resurfaced at 15:30, the weather had deteriorated, forcing her to reduce speed to 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph).
[2]
[4]
At 23:15 on 6 May 1942, she was 5 nautical miles (9.3 km; 5.8 mi) off Madagascar, near
Cap d'Ambre
(the northern tip of the island) and east-northeast of the
Alizès Pass
.
[2]
[4]
Loss
[
edit
]
At 03:10 on 7 May 1942,
Le Héros
passed around the northern tip of Madagascar,
[2]
heading for Courrier Bay on the northwestern coast to attack the British invasion fleet there.
[4]
After skirting a French
minefield
,
[2]
she reached a position off Courrier Bay at 04:30.
[2]
At dawn, a flight of eight
Fairey Swordfish
torpedo bombers
from the aircraft carrier
HMS
Illustrious
surprised her on the surface either north or west of Courrier Bay, according to different sources, and attacked her with depth charges.
[2]
[3]
She
crash-dived
, but a violent explosion shook her, knocking out her
electrical power
, rupturing her
compressed air
and
diesel fuel
systems, damaging her forward
diving planes
, and creating a leak which allowed
seawater
to enter her forward
battery
room, causing the release of poisonous
chlorine gas
.
[2]
The exploding depth charges forced her to the surface, and her
commanding officer
ordered her crew to abandon ship.
[2]
[4]
She sank 15 minutes after the attack, at 05:08, in 300 metres (984 ft) of water in the Indian Ocean at
.
[2]
[4]
[3]
Le Héros
′s entire crew of 72 men was left drifting in rough seas, and those without
lifebelts
quickly became exhausted and sank to their deaths.
[2]
Sometime later,
sharks
began to
attack
the survivors.
[2]
British ships reached the scene four hours after
Le Héros
sank, and the
infantry landing ship
HMS
Keren
rescued 52 survivors.
[2]
[4]
One source claims that other survivors reached the coast of Madagascar on their own.
[4]
Sources disagree on the number of men lost, claiming 19,
[4]
20,
[2]
and 24
[4]
[14]
men missing.

The
University of International Relations
(
UIR
;
Chinese
:
国际关系学院
;
pinyin
:
Guójì Guānxì Xuéyuàn
) is a
national
public university
in
Beijing
,
China
. It is known colloquially as "Guoguan"
(
国关
;
Guó Gūan
)
.
The Institute for International Relations, later translated into English as Institute
of
International Relations, was established in 1949 by the first
premier
of the People's Republic of China,
Zhou Enlai
, to train diplomats.
[1]
It became one of the
National Key Universities
in 1960, and was one of the first in China to offer master's degrees. In 1983, the school became the first foreign studies institute in China to evolve into a comprehensive university.
[2]
[3]
The UIR has offered a joint doctoral program with the
China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations
, the 11th Bureau of the
Ministry of State Security
(MSS), China's civilian intelligence agency.

A 2011 report by the
Open Source Enterprise
stated, "CICIR appears to have a close relationship with the University of International Relations in Beijing, with nearly half of the organization's senior leadership — including President Cui Liru and Director of the CICIR Institute of American Studies Yuan Peng — having either taught or studied at the school."
[6]
History
[
edit
]
UIR main academic building
The University of International Relations was founded in 1949 to train foreign affairs cadres for the newly created People's Republic of China. In 1961, the school merged with the
Foreign Affairs College
.
[7]
In 1964, then-Premier Zhou Enlai ordered the creation of colleges and university departments to focus on international affairs.
[8]
Several government agencies, including the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the
International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party
, established their own institutes for the study of international affairs. The University of International Relations was formally affiliated with the
Ministry of Public Security
in 1965, and was charged with training intelligence agents for the Central Investigation Department (both predecessors to the MSS) and for
Xinhua News Agency
.
[7]
[8]
Like many schools in China, the University of International Relations was shuttered during China's
Cultural Revolution
and reopened in 1978.
[9]
UIR library
In 1983, the school became the first foreign studies institute in China to evolve into a comprehensive university.
[2]
[3]
In 2021, UIR was authorized to offer
Ph.D.
in
politics
.
[10]
Affiliation with the Ministry of State Security
[
edit
]
Despite claims from CCP sources that UIR operates under the direction of the
Ministry of Education
,
[11]
[12]
[13]
the university does not appear on the Ministry of Education's list of subordinate universities, and every available academic source concludes that the university is an affiliate of the
Ministry of State Security
(MSS).

Also, provincial government documents suggest that the UIR is affiliated with the MSS, mentioning it alongside
Jiangnan Social University
, a known MSS training institute.
[18]
The university's campus is directly adjacent to the national headquarters of the MSS to the south and to the
Central Party School
of the
Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) to the west. According to
Stratfor
, "training for most MSS officers begins at the Beijing [campus of the] University of International Relations."
[19]
The
Historical Dictionary of Chinese Intelligence
states that the university's "relationship with the MSS is intended to be covert".
[1]
According to József Boda of Hungary's
National University of Public Service
, the "UIR gives the MSS a way to work with foreign universities and academics to shape and learn about perceptions of the PRC’s views on security. It also provides a platform for the MSS to identify talents, recruit officers and collect intelligence."

Folk dancers in traditional costume doing Volkspele at a
saamtrek
Folk dancers in traditional costume doing Volkspele while on tour in Europe
Two Volkspele participants, Willie van Vollenhoven and Dr. Anton van Vollenhoven with the bust of Dr. SH Pellisier in Boshof, South Africa
Volkspele
is a
South African
folk dance
tradition.
Directly translated,
Volkspele
means "folk-games" and can be translated to folk-dance. Folk-dance was the brain-child of South African Dr. SH Pellisier, who was visiting
Sweden
in 1915 with a friend to become more proficient in carpentry. After finishing their day's work they met with other young people in their respective countries' national dress to practise their folk-singing and -dancing. The South Africans were the only ones left out as they did not have any traditional dances.
Back in
South Africa
, Pellisier translated four Swedish dances and taught them to pupils at the
Afrikaans
High School in Boshof where he was Deputy Headmaster. During a Sunday School picnic on the farm Vuisfontein near Boshof on 22 February 1914 they performed the dances for the first time. The picnic games became known as volkspele.
With the help of the Reddingsdaadbond, an organisation which was established to assist poor Afrikaners after the Anglo Boer War, groups of dancers called
laers
were established throughout the country.
Get-togethers called
saamtrekke
are usually organised where all the
laers
get together to sing and do folk-dancing. The folk-dancers also present displays and have courses on different levels, seniors: people out of school, and juniors: learners in school, for either a weekend or longer. During the June school holidays there are also courses for grade 5-7 pupils (known as the
Judith Pellissierweek
- named after the wife of Dr Pellissier), grade 8-9 pupils (known as the
Vormingsweek
- Formative) and for grade 10-12 pupils (known as the
Pellisierweek
). From time to time there are overseas tours; or a folk-dance group or two will tour with South African folk-dancers in South Africa, giving displays at various towns. At these
saamtrekke
, displays, tours and courses the dress (
volkspeledrag
) is as the photos below show.
Tours have been conducted to
Europe
,
Namibia
, The
United States
and
Turkey
, with groups from
Italy
,
Germany
,
Belgium
and others touring South Africa.
The
dress
originated from the formal dress the pioneers or
Voortrekkers
wore. It is called national dress, as in the European countries.  All folk-dancers in South Africa must use the same style with only the colours differing. Each
laer
has its own colours for the ladies' dresses as well as for the men's waistcoats - these are embroidered with indigenous flower designs.

Aphasia
Agrammatism
is a characteristic of non-fluent aphasia.  Individuals with agrammatism present with speech that is characterized by containing mainly content words, with a lack of function words.  For example, when asked to describe a picture of children playing in the park, the affected individual responds with, "trees..children..run."
[1]
People with agrammatism may have
telegraphic speech
,
[2]
a unique
speech
pattern with simplified formation of
sentences
(in which many or all
function words
are omitted), akin to that found in
telegraph
messages. Deficits in agrammaticism are often language-specific, however—in other words, "agrammaticism" in speakers of one language may present differently from in speakers of another.
[3]
Errors made in agrammatism depend on the severity of aphasia. In severe forms language production is severely telegraphic and in more mild to moderate cases  necessary elements for sentence construction are missing.  Common errors include errors in tense, number, and gender.
[4]
Patients also find it very hard to produce sentences involving "movement" of elements, such as passive sentences,
wh-questions
or complex sentences.

Agrammatism is seen in many
brain
disease syndromes, including
expressive aphasia
and
traumatic brain injury

History
[
edit
]
Agrammatism was first coined by
Adolf Kussmaul
in 1887 to explain the inability to form words grammatically and to syntactically order them into a sentence. Later on,
Harold Goodglass
defined the term as the omission of
connective
words,
auxiliaries
and
inflectional
morphemes
, all of these generating a speech production with extremely rudimentary grammar. Agrammatism, today seen as a symptom of the
Broca's syndrome
(Tesak & Code, 2008), has been also referred as 'motor
aphasia
' (Goldstein, 1948), 'syntactic aphasia' (Wepman & Jones, 1964), 'efferent motor aphasia' (Luria, 1970), and 'non-fluent aphasia' (Goodglass et al., 1964).
The early accounts of agrammatism involved cases of
German
and
French
participants. The greater sophistication of the German school of aphasiology at the turn of the 20th century and also the fact that both German and French are highly
inflected languages
, might have been triggers for that situation (Code, 1991). Nowadays, the image has slightly changed: grammatical impairment has been found to be selective rather than complete, and a cross-linguistic perspective under the framework of
Universal Grammar
(UG) together with a shift from
morphosyntax
to morphosemantics is à la page. Now the focus of study in agrammatism embraces all natural languages and the
idiosyncrasies
scholars think a specific language has are put in relation to other languages so as to better understand agrammatism, help its treatment, and review and advance in the field of
theoretical linguistics
.

There is little written about agrammatism in Catalan. The beginnings of the field should be encountered in the work of Peña-Casanova & Bagunyà-Durich (1998), and Junque et al. (1989). These papers do not describe case reports, they are rather dealing with more general topics such as lesion localization or rehabilitation of agrammatic patients. The most updated studies could be found in the work of Martínez-Ferreiro (2009). The work of Martínez-Ferreiro is under the so-called Tree Pruning Hypothesis (TPH) of Friedmann & Grodzinsky (2007). Such a hypothesis is somewhat lagging behind after the findings in Bastiaanse (2008) have been proved by means of a re-analysis of data from Nanousi et al. (2006) and Lee et al. (2008), and the work of Yarbay Duman & Bastiaanse (2009). Other rather updated work for agrammatism in Catalan should be found in Martínez-Ferreiro et Gavarró (2007), in Gavarró (2008, 2003a, 2003b, 2002), Balaguer et al. (2004), in Peña-Casanova et al. (2001), and in Sánchez-Casas (2001).
From a cross-linguistic perspective under the framework of Universal Grammar (UG), grammatical impairment in agrammatism has been found to be selective rather than complete. Under this line of thought, the impairment in tense production for agrammatic speakers is currently being approached in different natural languages by means of the study of verb inflection for tense in contrast to agreement (a
morphosyntactic
approach) and also, more recently, by means of the study of time reference (which, in a sense, should be seen closer to morphosemantics).  The type of studies this paper should be related with are those dealing with tense impairment under the framework of time reference. Prior to explaining that, to help understand the goals of such research, it is good to give a taste of the shift from morphosyntax to morphosemantics the study of agrammatism is undergoing.

Verb Inflection
[
edit
]
Verb
inflection
for tense has been found to be problematic in several languages.  Different scholars have come up with different theories to explain it: Friedman & Grodzinsky (1997) introduced the so-called Tree Pruning Hypothesis (TPH) from the study of
Hebrew
,
Arabic
, and
English
; the same hypothesis has been proved by Gavarró & Martínez-Ferreiro (2007) for what they called Ibero-Romance (that is,
Catalan
,
Galician
, and
Castilian
); Wenzlaff & Clahsen  (2004; 2005) introduced the Tense Underespecification Hypothesis (TUH) for German, and by the same time Bruchert et al. (2005) introduced the Tense and Agreement Underespecification Hypothesis (TAUH) for the same language; and Lee et al. (2008), and Faroqi-Shah & Dickey (2009) introduced a morphosemantic hypothesis, arguing that the
diacritic
tense features are affected in English agrammatism.
[
citation needed
]
Bastiaanse (2008) did not find such dissociation for
Dutch
but rather that reference to the past is more impaired regardless of verb inflection or agreement. Her research found that
finite verbs
are more difficult than
non-finite verbs
, but both within the finite verbs and within the nonfinite verbs, the forms referring to the past (third person singular past tense and participle respectively) are more difficult than their counterparts referring to the present (third person singular present tense and infinitives). None of the hypotheses on verb forms aforementioned (TPH, TUH, and TAUH) can account for these results, ever since
participles
in Dutch are not inflected for tense and agreement nor do they check their features in the left periphery. Similar findings have been also reported for Greek and for English respectively in a re-analysis of Nanousi et al.'s (2006) and Lee et al.'s (2008) data, and also for
Turkish
in  Yarbay, Duman & Bastiaanse (2009). In any case, the conclusion of Bastiaanse (2008) was that an additional hypothesis expressing that agrammatic speakers have difficulty making reference to the past was needed. In that same paper she unveiled two possible answers: (a) it could be that representations of events in the past are semantically more complex, possibly because there are two time periods of relevance. (b) It might also be the case that it is not so much reference to the past as such that is difficult for agrammatic speakers, but to express this reference by verb inflection.

ORP
Batory
was a patrol boat of the Polish
Border Guard
which operated from the 1930s into the 1950s.
Service history
[
edit
]
The vessel was built by the State Engineering Works shipyard in
Modlin
, launched on 23 April 1932, and entered service with the Border Guard exactly two months later at
Hel
in the
Baltic Sea
. Her main task was to suppress smuggling in
Gdańsk Bay
.
[1]
She was the biggest and fastest vessel of the Border Guard, classified also as "pursuit cutter" (
kuter pościgowy
).
During the German
invasion of Poland
, the vessel was mobilized into the Polish Navy, and fought in
defence of the Hel Peninsula
, repelling air attacks on the port of Hel, and ensuring the maintenance of communication with the base in
Gdynia
. On 10 September the boat was disarmed, and the crew incorporated into the defenders of the peninsula.
[1]
Just after nightfall on 1 October, on the eve of the surrender of the Hel Peninsula, the crew, taking advantage of a thick fog, escaped across the Baltic to
neutral
Sweden. There, they and their boat were interned, not returning to Poland until 24 October 1945.
Batory
returned to Border Defence Army service.
[1]
After the war, she was initially named
Hel
(town of
Hel
). In the Stalinist period she was renamed to
7 Listopada
("7th November", a date of the
October Revolution
), then
Dzierżyński
(
Felix Dzerzhinsky
). Finally, she was given a neutral designation
KP-1
(for Kuter Patrolowy -
Patrol Boat
1).
[2]
In 1949 she captured a West German fishing boat on the Polish waters, commissioned next to the Polish Border Defence Army as
DP-53
.
[2]
In December 1957 the KP-1 was decommissioned and given to the paramilitary organization
Liga Przyjaciół Żołnierza
(Soldier's Friends' League).
[2]
From 1959 she served as a training and rescue vessel of the LPŻ on the
Vistula
in
Warsaw
, and next - of the new paramilitary organization
Liga Obrony Kraju
(Home Defence League) on
Zegrze Reservoir
, under a name
KP-1 Batory
. She was withdrawn from service in 1969.
[2]
Luckily, the
Batory
avoided scrapping, and in the 1970s she was placed on a monument in Hel naval base (not available for public). The hull and superstructure however were lacking equipment. Only in December 2009 she was given to the Polish Navy Museum in
Gdynia
, where she is going to be restored.

Андрей Сергеевич Ищенко
; born 9 March 1981), is a Russian politician who currently serves as a member of parliament in the
Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai
.
[1]
Biography
[
edit
]
Andrey Ishchenko was born on 9 March 1981 in the city of
Lesozavodsk
,
Primorsky Krai
. From 1988 to 1997, he studied at the secondary school No. 74 of the city of
Vladivostok
. From 1997 to 1998, he was at the lyceum at the
Far Eastern State Technical Fisheries University
[
ru
]
. In 1998, he entered that university. During the years of training, he was the commander of a
platoon
of cadets. He practiced on the sail
training ship
Pallada
under the guidance of the sea captain
Nikolai Zorchenko
[
ru
]
.
In 2004, he received a diploma of higher education with a degree in navigation engineer. He was awarded the military rank of lieutenant, military registration specialty, a commander of a mine-torpedo warhead, combat use of anti-submarine and torpedo weapons of surface ships.
In 2005, he began his maritime career in the
Far Eastern Shipping Company
as a third mate. In five years of work, he rose to the position of
chief mate
.
In 2011, he began work in the construction industry of the
Primorsky Krai
as an assistant to the director of a construction enterprise Investment company Vostochnye Vorota under the leadership of the Honored Builder of the RSFSR, Honorary Builder of Russia - Ivan Bulenko.
In 2014, he headed the construction company Aurora-Story LLC, which is engaged in housing construction in the cities of Primorsky Krai.
On 18 September 2016, Ishchenko
was elected
[
ru
]
a member of parliament, a deputy to the
Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai
of the sixth convocation in a single-mandate constituency number 1 - Vladivostok, part of the Pervomaisky district, gaining 24.66% of the votes of voters who came to the polling stations.
[2]
He is a former member of the Vladivostok Committee of the
Communist Party of the Russian Federation
, secretary of the primary branch of Pervomaiskoye.
In an interview, Ishchenko said that as the head of the region he was going to implement his program "20 steps" and was reforming the administration of the region. He promised to "continue the president's policy."
[3]
At the
2018 Russian elections
, on 9 September 2018, Ishchenko took second place in the first round of the
September 2018 Primorsky Krai gubernatorial election
, gaining 24.63% of the vote. His opponent,
Andrey Tarasenko
, won 46.56% of the vote.
He reached the second round of voting, which took place on 16 September.
[4]
On 17 September 2018, Ishchenko did not agree with the results of the elections, went on a hunger strike and called on the residents of the region to go to the
Square of Fighters for Soviet Power
[
ru
]
to hold a popular
veche
. The head of the
Central Election Commission
,
Ella Pamfilova
, said that the CEC will not sum up the results of the governor elections in Primorye until it understands the situation. Later, the election results were annulled, and Ishchenko went to court. On 28 December 2018, the
Supreme Court of Russia
dismissed the claim. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation did not nominate Ishchenko to run in the re-run, claiming that he won the governor's election, but that victory was stolen.
On 7 November 2018, Ishchenko announced on his social networks his decision to participate in the repeated
December 2018 Primorsky Krai gubernatorial election
on 16 December as a self-nominated candidate. Ishchenko's headquarters collected more than 15,000 signatures of the inhabitants of the region (submitted to the Regional Election Commission - 8,000 signatures) and the required number of signatures of municipal deputies of various levels (municipal filter). Registration as a candidate for governor was denied.
In the fall of 2021, Ishchenko was arrested on suspicion of fraud in the construction of a residential building on the funds of equity holders. The amount of damage by the prosecutor's office is estimated at 380 million rubles.
In October 2022, Ishchenko applied to the military commissariat with a request to send him to fight in Ukraine.

opens up on the last day of autumn. At Redwall Abbey, the two Dibbuns (toddlers) Bungo and Tubspike are playing outside, waiting for a group of travelling performers that are expected at the Abbey. The Abbot had given them permission to welcome them.
The performers arrive, enter the abbey, and put on a show. Finally, when it is time for bed, the Dibbuns are told the story of the Snow Badger, a mythical creature who makes the snow fall.
Just before dawn the next morning, the Dibbun mole Bungo sees the Snow Badger and is able to talk to him! When the little mole wakes up, he finds a pouch around his neck. It contains a small crystal drop, and a note is written on the inside of the pouch on a scrap of parchment. It is in the form of a riddle, but what does it mean? The Redwallers must try to figure it out...

Saitama Stadium 2002
was not available due to pitch maintenance around this date, and then, would see Urawa having to host the second leg at the
Urawa Komaba Stadium
. As a result of this conflict, the
AFC
decided to rearrange the dates even further on the calendar, rescheduling the matches to late April and early May.

O
6
-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase
(also known as
AGT
,
MGMT
or
AGAT
) is a
protein
that in humans is encoded by the
O
6
-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (
MGMT
)
gene
.
[5]
[6]
O
6
-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase is crucial for genome stability. It repairs the naturally occurring mutagenic DNA lesion
O
6
-methylguanine
back to
guanine
and prevents mismatch and errors during
DNA replication
and
transcription
. Accordingly, loss of
MGMT
increases the carcinogenic risk in mice after exposure to
alkylating agents
.
[7]
The two bacterial
isozymes
are
Ada
and
Ogt
.

Although
alkylating
mutagens
preferentially modify the guanine base at the N7 position,
O
6
-alkyl-guanine is a major carcinogenic lesion in
DNA
. This
DNA adduct
is removed by the repair protein
O
6
-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase through an
S
N
2 mechanism
. This protein is not a true
enzyme
since it removes the alkyl group from the lesion in a
stoichiometric
reaction and the active enzyme is not regenerated after it is alkylated (referred to as a
suicide enzyme
). The methyl-acceptor residue in the protein is a
cysteine
.

Clinical significance
[
edit
]
In patients with
glioblastoma
, a severe type of brain tumor, the cancer medicine
temozolomide
is more effective in those with a
methylation
of the gene's
promoter
.
[9]
Overall,
MGMT
methylation is associated with prolonged patient survival in clinical prediction models.
[10]
For testing of the MGMT promoter methylation status in the clinical setting, DNA-based methods such as methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) or pyrosequencing are preferred over immunohistochemical or RNA- based assays.
[11]
In patients with pituitary tumours, MGMT can predict the clinical and radiological response to treatment with temozolomide. In this context the MGMT status is optimally assessed by immunohistochemistry, with MGMT depleted tumours expected to demonstrate a response.
[12]
Promotor methylation status (of MGMT) does not predict temozolomide response because, in pituitary tumours, the promotor is almost always unmethylated.
[13]
MGMT
has also been shown to be a useful tool increasing gene therapy efficiency. By using a two component vector consisting of a transgene of interest and
MGMT
,
in vivo
drug selection can be utilized to select for successfully transduced cells.
[14]
Mutagens in the environment,
[15]
in tobacco smoke,
[16]
food,
[17]
as well as endogenous metabolic products
[18]
generate reactive electrophilic species that
alkylate
or  specifically
methylate
DNA, generating
6-O-methylguanine
(m6G).
In 1985 Yarosh summarized the early work that established m6G as the alkylated base in DNA that was the most mutagenic and carcinogenic.
[19]
In 1994 Rasouli-Nia et al.
[20]
showed that about one mutation was induced for every eight unrepaired
m6Gs
in DNA.  Mutations can cause progression to cancer by a process of natural selection.

Epigenetic repression
[
edit
]
Only a minority of sporadic cancers with a DNA repair deficiency have a mutation in a DNA repair gene.  However, a majority of sporadic cancers with a DNA repair deficiency do have one or more
epigenetic
alterations that reduce or silence DNA repair gene expression.  For example, in a study of 113 sequential colorectal cancers, only four had a
missense mutation
in the DNA repair gene
MGMT
, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the
MGMT
promoter region (an
epigenetic
alteration).
[41]
MGMT can be epigenetically repressed in a number of ways.
[42]
When MGMT expression is repressed in cancers, this is often due to methylation of its promoter region.
[42]
However, expression can also be repressed by di-methylation of lysine 9 of histone 3
[43]
or by over-expression of a number of microRNAs including miR-181d, miR-767-3p and miR-603.
[42]
[44]
[45]
MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is an important cancer biomarker because it is involved in the repair of DNA damage and is often silenced or inactivated in cancer cells. The loss of MGMT function leads to a higher rate of mutations, promoting the formation and progression of tumors. The presence or absence of MGMT expression in a cancer sample can indicate a patient's response to alkylating chemotherapy, which is a common treatment for certain types of cancer. Hence, MGMT can be used as a prognostic marker to predict the likelihood of treatment response and to guide the selection of appropriate therapies. A number of point-of-care devices are under development to monitor the methylation status of MGMT.
[46]
Deficiency in field defects
[
edit
]
Longitudinally opened freshly resected colon segment showing a cancer and four polyps.  Plus a schematic diagram indicating a likely field defect (a region of tissue that precedes and predisposes to the development of cancer) in this colon segment. The diagram indicates sub-clones and sub-sub-clones that were precursors to the tumors.
A
field defect
is an area or "field" of epithelium that has been preconditioned by epigenetic changes and/or mutations so as to predispose it towards development of cancer.  A field defect is illustrated in the photo and diagram shown of a colon segment having a colon cancer and four small polyps within the same area as well.  As pointed out by Rubin, "The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors
in vivo,
or on discrete neoplastic foci
in vitro.
[47]
Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion."
[48]
Similarly, Vogelstein et al.
[49]
point out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells.
In the Table above, MGMT deficiencies were noted in the field defects (histologically normal tissues) surrounding most of the cancers.  If MGMT is epigenetically reduced or silenced, it would not likely confer a selective advantage upon a stem cell. However, reduced or absent expression of MGMT would cause increased rates of mutation, and one or more of the mutated genes may provide the cell with a selective advantage. The expression-deficient
MGMT
gene could then be carried along as a selectively neutral or only slightly deleterious passenger (hitch-hiker) gene when the mutated stem cell generates an expanded clone. The continued presence of a clone with an epigenetically repressed
MGMT
would continue to generate further mutations, some of which could produce a tumor.
Deficiency with exogenous damage
[
edit
]
MGMT deficiency alone may not be sufficient to cause progression to cancer.  Mice with a homozygous mutation in
MGMT
did not develop more cancers than wild-type mice when grown without stress.
[50]
However, stressful treatment of mice with azoxymethane and dextran sulphate caused more than four colonic tumors per MGMT mutant mouse, but less than one tumor per wild-type mouse.
[51]
Repression in coordination with other DNA repair genes
[
edit
]
In a cancer, multiple DNA repair genes are often found to be simultaneously repressed.
[52]
In one example, involving
MGMT
, Jiang et al.
[53]
conducted a study where they evaluated the mRNA expression of 27 DNA repair genes in 40
astrocytomas
compared to normal brain tissues from non-astrocytoma individuals. Among the 27 DNA repair genes evaluated, 13 DNA repair genes,
MGMT,
NTHL1
,
OGG1
,
SMUG1
,
ERCC1,
ERCC2
,
ERCC3
,
ERCC4
,
MLH1
,
MLH3
,
RAD50
,
XRCC4
and
XRCC5
were all significantly down-regulated in all three grades (II, III and IV) of astrocytomas. The repression of these 13 genes in lower grade as well as in higher grade astrocytomas suggested that they may be important in early as well as in later stages of astrocytoma.  In another example, Kitajima et al.
[54]
found that immunoreactivity for MGMT and
MLH1
expression was closely correlated in 135 specimens of gastric cancer and loss of  MGMT and hMLH1 appeared to be synchronously accelerated during tumor progression.
Deficient expression of multiple DNA repair genes are often found in cancers,
[52]
and may contribute to the thousands of mutations usually found in cancers (see
mutation frequencies in cancers
).

The
Tarakan riot
was an
ethnic riot
which occurred between September 27 and September 29, 2010 in the city of
Tarakan
,
East Kalimantan
(now part of
North Kalimantan
),
Indonesia
. The riot pitched native
Tidung people
against
Bugis migrants
.
[1]
[2]
It was triggered by the death of a Tidung elder in a scuffle with a youth gang.
[3]
During the ensuing riot four people were killed and thousands of civilians were displaced, before a peace agreement was made between the communities.
[4]
Background
[
edit
]
Tarakan
, located on
Tarakan Island
, is one of the major cities in
eastern Borneo
(now
Northern Borneo
). It had a population of 178,111 in 2008. Native residents are the
Tidung
, a subgroup of the
Dayak
people. The city also has a multi-ethnic population from other parts of Indonesia, such as
Bugis
,
Javanese
and
Chinese Indonesians
.
[5]
The Tidung are a group of
Malayised
Dayak
people who live in the north-eastern part of Borneo and surrounding small islands. They live on both sides of the border of
Malaysia
and
Indonesia
. They are closely related to other native people in
Sabah
and
East Kalimantan
, such as the
Murut people
. Tidung speak Tidong language, one of the
North Bornean languages
.
[6]
The
Bugis
have been migrating from their homeland in
South Sulawesi
since the fall of
Makassar
to the
Dutch East India Company
in 1669.
[7]
[8]
They had settled in parts of maritime Southeast Asia, especially eastern Borneo, but also as far away from
Irian
to the
Malay peninsula
and
Sumatra
.
Both ethnic groups are predominantly
Muslim
and relations among them are generally peaceful. However, the economic situation caused discontent between natives and migrants, who are
perceived to be advantaged
.

The riots
[
edit
]
The riot was not directly triggered as an ethnic conflict, but began as a criminal act. On midnight of Monday, September 27, Abdullah, a 50-year-old elder from the Tidung tribe, was killed in a scuffle with a group of young men, who were from the Bugis tribe.
[1]
Abdullah was beaten to death by the gang after a quarrel about money. His son, Abdur Rahman was injured in the scuffle.
[9]
The incident infuriated local
Tidung people
, who took to the street to protest and began
searching for the perpetrator
. In the early morning of September 27, 50 armed Tidungs began searching youth gang members involved in the incidents. This created tension with the Bugis. An attempt to mediate the dispute in the late night of Monday, September 27 failed because leading ethnic figures were already massed on the field.
[10]
On Tuesday, September 28, Police finally captured two of the youth gang members involved in Abdullah's death, but tension had already escalated and civilians fled into refugee camps.
[10]
During a second day of tension, the night of Tuesday, September 28, a deadly clash finally occurred between hundreds of people from both ethnic groups. Hundreds of properties were burned and two people were killed.
On the third day, in early morning of Wednesday, September 29, another clash occurred and two more people were killed, bringing the total death casualties during the riot to four people.
[10]
[11]
Casualties and effects
[
edit
]
In addition to Abdullah, killed by the youth gang, another four people were killed in the ensuing clashes.
[4]
Six others were injured, suffering slash wounds to their hands and legs.
[12]
Rising tension and violence caused fear among both ethnic groups. As many as 32,000 people were displaced during the conflict.
[13]
The refugees mostly took shelter in military and government buildings, such as schools. In addition to casualties, shops and properties were burned by the rioters, while many other were closed.
Responses
[
edit
]
Following clashes, a call for peace was made by the government and public in Indonesia. The Head of  the Tarakan
Ulama
Council, Syamsi Sarman called for peace and visited victims' families to express condolences. He also called for police to swiftly stop the violence and control the masses.
[14]
The President of Indonesia,
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
urged all parties to work together comprehensively to settle the inter-community dispute. He was also especially concerned that the riot might develop into a bloodbath like the
Sampit conflict
in 2001, one of the bloodiest conflicts during
Indonesia's transition to democracy
.
[2]
Minister of Interior
Gamawan Fauzi
tried to calm the masses by reminding them that the riot was originally an ordinary criminal incident, which accidentally involved two different ethnic groups.
[15]
He also expressed dismay that violence was still used to solve local problems.
[16]
Calls for peace also came from
South Sulawesi
province, homeland of the Bugis. The South Sulawesi Families Association called for the Bugis-Makassar and Tarakan groups to make peace following the clash. South Sulawesi Governor Syahrul Yasin Limpo had spoken with the East
Kalimantan
Governor
Awang Faroek Ishak
to inquire about the situation, and called for peace negotiations.
[17]
To anticipate a bigger clash, the Tarakan Police requested reinforcement to handle the riot.
[9]
Two battalions, one each from the
Police’s
Mobile Brigade
and the
Indonesian Military
were deployed to control the masses.
[1]
[18]
During the clashes, Tarakan port was closed to prevent people from mainland
Kalimantan
coming to
Tarakan Island
; effectively stopping outside groups from increasing tension in the community.
[19]
The police finally captured the suspect and the government managed to hold peace negotiations to end the conflict. Law enforcement performance was criticized during the riot, with observers noting that the clashes would have ended sooner had the police and military responded more promptly.
[12]
Police were also criticized for their management of the conflict, only securing the original scuffle area and failing to handle congregating groups in other places.
[20]
Peace agreements
[
edit
]
The peace treaty between the groups reached agreement on both sides on Wednesday, September 29. The negotiations were held in
Juwata Airport
in Tarakan. The peace was facilitated by the Government, especially
East Kalimantan
Governor Awang Faroek and concluded by representatives of both Tidung and Bugis people.
[4]
Under the peace accord, the two ethnic groups agreed to jointly hold an
Idul Fitri
celebration (usually a holiday that marks the end of
Ramadan
).
[12]
They called on the police to take perpetrators of the rioting to court and appealed to all to respect local traditions. Both groups agreed to forgive each other and cease all violence.
[21]
After signing the agreement, both groups handed over their weapons to the police.
Conditions were almost back to normal on Thursday, September 30 when banks, markets and shops reopened and residents returned from refugee camps.
[22]
During the normalization period, Tarakan remained on alert for two more weeks.

The Paul Hogan Show
was a popular Australian comedy show which aired on Australian television from 1973 until 1984 for a total of 12 seasons and 60 episodes.  It made a star of
Paul Hogan
, who later appeared in
Crocodile Dundee
.
Hogan's friend (and producer of
Crocodile Dundee
)
John Cornell
also appeared in the show, playing Hogan's dim flatmate Strop.
Premise
[
edit
]
Episodes of the series generally opened with Hogan, playing a version of himself he called 'Hoges', presenting a stand-up comedy routine dressed in his bridge rigger's costume of boots, shorts, and shirt with sleeves cut off.  The show then presented a series of comedy sketches, usually with Hogan in the lead role and playing various recurring characters. These include:
Leo Wanker
: an inept daredevil stuntman;
George Fungus
: a
take-off
of real-life television journalist
George Negus
of the Australian
60 Minutes
;
Super Dag
: an
ocker
superhero
complete with
terry-towelling
hat and
zinc-creamed
nose. His powers include his ability to use his
esky
in innovative ways;
Perce the Wino
: an old drunken
derro
who starred in a series of silent,
Benny Hill
-style, sketches;
Donger
: variants of this beer-gutted character include Sgt Donger, the tough cop with a bionic beer-gut, and Arthur Dunger, a caricature of the suburban
tinny
-chugging Australian male.
Nigel Lovelace
: a skateboarding eleven-year-old ("almost twelve" as they say in the show);
The Phantom
: a parody of the famous comic book hero
The Phantom
Arthur Dunger
: a beer swilling pier bum.
Another recurring sketch featured Hogan again playing "himself" as Hoges, depicting the character's situation of living the carefree bachelor life in a disorderly apartment with his flatmate Strop.
The show would generally end with him in his bridge painter getup trying to flip cigarettes into his mouth.
The series also regularly featured attractive female models and actresses in its sketches - frequently in revealing costumes. Television actress and presenter
Delvene Delaney
(who later married Cornell) was the most frequent and best-known of these. Other women to appear in the series were
Sue McIntosh
,
Karen Pini
,
Anya Saleky
,
Karen West
and
Abigail
.
[1]
Many sketches in the show were parodies of contemporary television shows. These included
"Thick 'Ead"
(
Mastermind
),
"Pot o'Brass"
(
Pot o'Gold
),
"A Casual Affair"
(
A Current Affair
)
"Sale of the Week"
(
Sale of the Century
), and
"Benny Five'O"
(a
Benny Hill
-inspired take-off of
Hawaii Five-O
).
Theme music
[
edit
]
The theme music was taken from the second movement of
Tchaikovsky
's
Symphony No.5
. This music was also used in contemporary advertisements for
Winfield
cigarettes, which featured Hogan.
Reception
[
edit
]
The show was very popular in Australia and was compared to
Saturday Night Live
and
The Benny Hill Show
. The series also became popular in the UK as a result of its scheduling within peak time on the new
Channel 4
, and was one of the shows shown on its launch night on 2 November 1982.
Networks
[
edit
]
After appearances on
A Current Affair
and specials for the
Nine Network
, Hogan and producer John Cornell fell out with network owner
Clyde Packer
. The first three seasons from 1973 to 1975 of the Paul Hogan Show were on the
Seven Network
until
Kerry Packer
took over Channel 9 and invited them back.

Slovak writer
August Horislav Škultéty
August Horislav Škultéty
(
Hungarian
:
Skultéty Ágost Horislaw
; August 7, 1819 - May 29, 1892) was a Slovak writer,
pedagogue
, and ethnographer, and the director of the first Slovak high school in
Revúca
.
Early years and career
[
edit
]
Teaching staff at the Slovak Lutheran high school in Revúca, 1868
August Horislav Škultéty was born in
Veľký Krtíš
and attended basic school in
Tisovec
. From 1833 to 1836 he attended lower secondary school at the Lutheran Lyceum in
Banská Štiavnica
and graduated from the Lutheran high school in
Kežmarok
. During 1836-1839, he studied theology at the Lutheran Seminary in
Bratislava
.
[1]
Beginning in 1839 he was assistant of the professor
Juraj Palkovič
at the Department of Czech and Slovak Speech and Literature, Lutheran Seminary in
Bratislava
. He was a chaplain of
Tisovec
in the years 1841-1848, under Pavol Jozeffy's superintendency. From 1847/48 to 1850 he served as a priest in
Dlhá Ves
and from 1850 to 1861 in
Rozložná
.
[2]
[3]
He moved to the first Slovak-language
high school
, which was created in
Revúca
, where he worked from 1862 to 1874.
[4]
From 1875 to 1891 he was a priest in Kraskovo, where he died in 1892.
During his stay in
Bratislava
, he actively promoted the use of Slovak in secondary schools as well as Protestant universities.
[5]
Škultéty played an important role in the development of the Department of Czech and Slovak at the Lutheran Seminary.
During his stay in
Tisovec
he belonged to the founders of a public reading circle and a church library. In 1847 the Lutheran Seminary in Bratislava had been closed by Hungarian authorities.
[6]
In the revolutionary years of 1848-1849, he was arrested and examined by Hungarian authorities at court in Plešivec because of his literal and political struggle for the development of the national life of Slovaks. 
He became a member of the committee for the establishment of the first Slovak
high school
in
Revúca
, opened on September 16, 1862.
[4]
He worked there as a professor of religion, and later as director. Under his guidance, the institute became an important center of Slovak education and this fact caused permanent attacks of
Magyarisation
school policy, which peaked in 1874, when the school was closed by the Hungarian authorities.
Literary works
[
edit
]
His literal work significantly developed Slovak literature, education and
pedagogy
, particularly for children and
youth
. In 1840, he published his collection of poetry, named
Básne
, as the first person from the
Štúr
generation.
[7]
Zábavník pre dietky
was the first original literary work for children written in Slovak. Then in 1850 and 1855 Škultéty's two text books
Rečňovanka pre Slovenskje školi
were issued, which affected the patriotic,
linguistic
and
aesthetic
education in Slovak
schools
. He collected and transcribed Slovak folk fairy tales together with
Štefan Marko Daxner
and
Čipka
, and these were preserved in the Codex Tisovský, one of the main sources of Škultéty and
Dobšinský
's
Slovenské povesti
(Slovak Tales, 1858-1861).
[8]
[3]
Altogether he is an author of 14 textbooks, but the vast majority of them remained in
manuscript
form.
Legacy
[
edit
]
Libraries in
Veľký Krtíš
[9]
and in
Tisovec
are named after him.
[10]
August Horislav Škultéty High School in Veľký Krtíš was also named in his honor.

T in the Park festival
was a major Scottish
music festival
that was held annually from 1994 to 2016. It was named after its main sponsor,
Tennents
. The event was held at
Strathclyde Park
,
Lanarkshire
, until 1996. It then moved to the disused
Balado
airfield,
Perth and Kinross
, from 1997 to 2014. In 2015 the festival moved to
Strathallan Castle
. It was originally held over two days, and extended to three days from 2007. In 2016 the daily capacity was 70,000.
[1]
The 2017 T in the Park was cancelled due to problems at the 2016 event. It was officially replaced with the
TRNSMT
festival which takes place on the same weekend at
Glasgow Green
. The 2017 festival was a success and further editions of TRNSMT followed in 2018 and 2019.
[2]
In July 2019, the festival organiser, Geoff Ellis, confirmed that T in the Park would not be returning.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
The festival was founded in 1994 by Stuart Clumpas and Geoff Ellis,
[4]
as part of a joint venture between
DF Concerts
and
Tennent's Lager
with some help from Irish promotions company
MCD Productions
.
[5]
Stuart Clumpas left as an organiser in 2001, selling his commercial interests in the concert.
[6]
[7]
Festival director Geoff Ellis was involved from the start until the end. Ellis came to Scotland in 1992 to manage
King Tut's Wah Wah Hut
in Glasgow. He organised the first T in the Park festival in 1994 with a smattering of bands playing to 17,000 people at its original site at Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire.
[8]
The festival was held there for three years until 1997, where it was held at the disused Balado airfield, Perth and Kinross. After moving to Balado the festival grew larger and by 2003, the festival was attracting up to 255,000 people; 110,000 over the weekend.
[5]
The festival was originally a two-day event until 2007, when the Friday became a mainstay event for live music. However, the 2007 festival was criticised by many festival-goers who missed acts on the Friday due to huge traffic jams of 10 miles on the
A91
and
A977
leading to Kinross.
[9]
To prevent a repeat of the traffic chaos, in 2008 organisers allowed a limited number of campers to pitch up on the Thursday in order to cut the number of cars on the roads on the Friday.
[10]
By extending the festival over a full three days, it began to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest greenfield festival in the United Kingdom, and the fifth-largest in the world in terms of attendance, with over 85,000 people on site every day.
[11]
In 2013 it attracted up to 255,000 people over three days, drawing fans from across Britain and Europe.
[8]
According to DF Concerts, 20% of the crowd was made up of visitors from outside Scotland, with about 2% attending from overseas.
[12]
In later years the festival shared much of its line-up with
Oxegen
, a festival that takes place on the same weekend in
County Kildare
, Ireland. Acts usually played T in the Park one day and Oxegen the next, or vice versa. In an attempt to boost ticket sales, the 2014 festival saw an extension of the acts' duration on stage. On the Friday, the acts were scheduled to start around lunchtime as opposed to 5 pm; and the Saturday headliners to finish at 1 am.
[13]
Move from Balado to Strathallan
[
edit
]
The 2014 festival was the last to take place at the Balado site. Despite having run on the same site since 1997, safety concerns were expressed about the
Forties Pipeline
, which runs directly underneath the former Balado airfield.
[14]
In 2015 the festival moved 20.54 miles to the Strathallan Castle Estate.
[15]
The 2016 event was marred by the deaths of three festival-goers and reports of anti-social behaviour problems at the campsite. This led festival bosses to cancel the 2017 event and, ultimately, all future T in the Park festivals.
[16]
Brewing
[
edit
]
Tennents Lager for the T in the Park weekend was specially brewed 36 hours before  the festival at the
Wellpark Brewery
in
Glasgow
, 44 miles from Balado. More than 3 million pints of lager were consumed at the festival during its existence.
[12]
A container recycling scheme was introduced in 2006, refunding a 10p deposit on every pint container brought back to a designated recycling point.
[12]
1994 festival
[
edit
]
The first T in the Park was held on Saturday 30 July - Sunday 31 July 1994 at
Strathclyde Country park
. The site had a capacity for 17,000 people on each of the two days,  with just 2000 choosing to camp.
[17]
The Caledonia Stage, was introduced to showcase up and coming new bands. A band called Glass Onion played over the weekend who would later be better known as
Travis
.

(
née
Goldwasser
; born December 5, 1932) is an American legal scholar. She is known for her writings on
legal theory
,

Biography
[
edit
]
Louise Weinberg was educated at Cornell (A.B. summa) (Phi Beta Kappa), and Harvard (J.D. 1969, LL.M. 1974).  She clerked for Judge
Charles Edward Wyzanski Jr.
and was an associate in litigation at Bingham, Dana & Gould, Boston.  At Harvard, Brandeis, and Stanford she taught courses in the American legal system, constitutional law, Supreme Court history, federal courts, and the conflict of laws.  In 1980 she joined the law faculty at the University of Texas, where she held the Raybourn Thompson professorship, and, later, the endowed William B. Bates Chair in the Administration of Justice, formerly held by
Charles Alan Wright
. In 1982 she was joined in Texas by her husband,
Steven Weinberg
, a Nobel laureate in physics.  Louise Weinberg is author of the 1200-page study, Federal Courts: Judicial Federalism and Judicial Power (West, 1994), and numerous scholarly papers and contributions.  Her works address the sources of lawmaking power and the debate on legal theory in the conflict of laws, offering a unification of conflicts theory with constitutional theory.  She is a member of, and appointed adviser to, the American Law Institute, and she has frequently chaired sections of the Association of American Law Schools on Conflict of Laws and on Federal Courts.     Louise Weinberg became emeritus in 2021 when she was 88 years of age.
Contributions to legal theory
[
edit
]
In 1977 Weinberg introduced the concept of "judicial federalism."
[2]
She engaged in a 1989 debate with Martin Redish concerning controversial federal judicial lawmaking, and clarified the nature of federal common law.
[3]
Weinberg concentrated on choice-of-law theory,
[4]
and proposed a reconceptualization of the field,
[5]
ultimately achieving a unification of the concepts of due process, rationality, and tiered scrutiny with choice of law.
[6]
Weinberg became interested in uncovering hidden rationales in Supreme Court cases,
[7]
and in this interest clarified the causative role of the Dred Scott case in the coming of the Civil War, countering revisionist normalization of Dred Scott
[8]
while showing that judicial attempts to reverse Dred Scott, as opposed to constitutional amendment, would have been counterproductive.
[9]
In 2003, when
Marbury v. Madison
, the early Supreme Court case placing the federal government under the rule of law, came under revisionist attack, Weinberg published her defense of the case.
[10]
Throughout she was interested in the problem of instantiating justice within the American dual-law, dual-court, multistate legal systems, and on the histories of the times in the backgrounds of supreme court cases on these systems.

A
functional brief
, in
project management
, is a
document
that talks about the functional
specifications
of the product that is being developed. A well-defined functional brief allows for all
stakeholders
to be aware of the scope of the product, the intended functionality and when finalized ensures that there is no
feature creep
. Once the document is created it is used to conduct a
feasibility study
and can be used to develop costs and time estimates of the final product.
The document should highlight:
[1]
The major functional aspects of the product,
How they are intended to interact and their inter-dependencies,
How the product being developed matches the organization's goals and policies,
How the user would interact with the product and
What output they intend to obtain from the product.
The functional brief can also contain information about the future plans for the product so that developers can ensure that while designing the product these considerations are included.

Emerging technologies
are
technologies
whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized. These technologies are generally
new
but also include older technologies finding new applications. Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the
status quo
.
Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not in origins), relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous."
[1]
Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as
educational technology
,
information technology
,
nanotechnology
,
biotechnology
,
robotics
, and
artificial intelligence
.
[note 1]
New technological fields may result from the
technological convergence
of different systems evolving towards similar goals. Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies.
Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for
competitive advantage
;
[2]
converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies varies.
History of emerging technologies
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of technology
In the
history of technology
, emerging technologies
[3]
[4]
are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of
technology
.
Over centuries innovative methods and new technologies have been developed and opened up. Some of these technologies are due to theoretical research, and others from commercial
research and development
.
Technological growth includes incremental developments and
disruptive technologies
. An example of the former was the gradual roll-out of
DVD
(digital video disc) as a development intended to follow on from the previous optical technology
compact disc
. By contrast, disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous technology and makes it redundant, for example, the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by automobiles and other vehicles.
Emerging technology debates
[
edit
]
See also:
Technology and society
Many writers, including
computer scientist
Bill Joy
,
[5]
have identified clusters of technologies that they consider critical to humanity's future. Joy warns that the technology could be used by elites for
good
or
evil
. They could use it as "good shepherds" for the rest of humanity or decide everyone else is superfluous and push for the mass extinction of those made unnecessary by technology.
[6]
Advocates of the benefits of
technological change
typically see emerging and converging technologies as offering hope for the betterment of the
human condition
. Cyberphilosophers
Alexander Bard
and
Jan Söderqvist
argue in
The Futurica Trilogy
that while Man himself is basically constant throughout human history (
genes
change very slowly), all relevant change is rather a direct or indirect result of technological innovation (
memes
change very fast) since new ideas always emanate from technology use and not the other way around.
[7]
Man should consequently be regarded as history's main constant and technology as its main variable. However, critics of the risks of technological change, and even some advocates such as
transhumanist
philosopher
Nick Bostrom
, warn that some of these technologies could pose dangers, perhaps even contribute to the
extinction of humanity
itself; i.e., some of them could involve
existential risks
.
[8]
[9]
Much
ethical debate
centers on issues of
distributive justice
in allocating access to beneficial forms of technology. Some thinkers, including
environmental ethicist
Bill McKibben
, oppose the continuing development of advanced technology partly out of fear that its benefits will be distributed unequally in ways that could worsen the
plight of the poor
.
[10]
By contrast,
inventor
Ray Kurzweil
is among
techno-utopians
who believe that emerging and converging technologies could and will
eliminate poverty
and abolish suffering.
[11]
Some analysts such as Martin Ford, author of
The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future
,
[12]
argue that as information technology advances, robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant
unemployment
as machines and software begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine jobs.
As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further, even many skilled jobs may be threatened. Technologies such as machine learning
[13]
may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledge-based jobs that require significant education. This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels, stagnant or falling wages for most workers, and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever-larger fraction of the economy. This in turn could lead to depressed
consumer spending
and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy.

Outline of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence
(
AI
) is the sub intelligence exhibited by machines or software, and the branch of
computer science
that develops machines and software with animal-like intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents," where an
intelligent agent
is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.
John McCarthy
, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the study of making intelligent machines".
The central functions (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge,
planning
, learning,
natural language processing
(communication),
perception
and the ability to
move and manipulate objects
. General intelligence (or "
strong AI
") is still among the field's long-term goals. Currently, popular approaches include deep learning, statistical methods, computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI. There is an enormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics, and many others.

Main article:
3D printing
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has been posited by
Jeremy Rifkin
and others as part of the
third industrial revolution
.
[17]
Combined with Internet technology, 3D printing would allow for digital blueprints of virtually any material product to be sent instantly to another person to be produced on the spot, making purchasing a product online almost instantaneous.
Although this technology is still too crude to produce most products, it is rapidly developing and created a controversy in 2013 around the issue of
3D printed firearms
.

Gene therapy

Main article:
Gene therapy
See also:
Genetic engineering timeline
Gene therapy was first successfully demonstrated in late 1990/early 1991 for
adenosine deaminase deficiency
, though the treatment was somatic - that is, did not affect the patient's germ line and thus was not heritable. This led the way to treatments for other genetic diseases and increased interest in
germ line gene therapy
- therapy affecting the gametes and descendants of patients.
Between September 1990 and January 2014, there were around 2,000 gene therapy trials conducted or approved.

Cancer vaccine
A
cancer vaccine
is a
vaccine
that treats existing

or prevents the development of cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as
therapeutic
cancer vaccines. There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general.
On April 14, 2009, The

, a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)  approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.
[20]
The approval of Provenge has stimulated interest in this type of therapy.

Main article:
Cultured meat
Cultured meat
, also called
in vitro meat
,
clean meat
,
cruelty-free meat
,
shmeat
, and
test-tube meat
, is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the
fetal calf serum
taken from a slaughtered cow.  In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on
in vitro
meat in the laboratory.
[22]
The
first in vitro beefburger
, created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013.
[23]
There remain difficulties to be overcome before
in vitro
meat becomes commercially available.
[24]
Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves.
[25]
[26]
In vitro
meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.

Outline of nanotechnology
Nanotechnology
(sometimes shortened to
nanotech
) is the manipulation of matter on an
atomic
,
molecular
, and
supramolecular
scale. The earliest widespread description of nanotechnology
[27]
[28]
referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as
molecular nanotechnology
. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the
National Nanotechnology Initiative
, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100
nanometers
. This definition reflects the fact that
quantum mechanical
effects are important at this
quantum-realm
scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.

Stem-cell therapy

Main article:
Stem-cell therapy
Stem cell therapy
is an intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue in order to treat disease or injury. Many
medical researchers
believe that stem cell treatments have the potential to change the face of human disease and alleviate suffering.
[30]
The ability of
stem cells
to self-renew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities
[31]
offers significant potential for generation of tissues that can potentially replace diseased and damaged areas in the body, with minimal risk of rejection and side effects.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have raised among other immunotherapies for cancer treatment, being implemented against B-cell malignancies. Despite the promising outcomes of this innovative technology, CAR-T cells are not exempt from limitations that must yet to be overcome in order to provide reliable and more efficient treatments against other types of cancer.

.
Smart contracts
are self-executing transactions which occur when pre-defined conditions are met. The aim is to provide security that is superior to traditional contract law, and to reduce transaction costs and delays. The original idea was conceived by
Nick Szabo
in 1994,

Development of emerging technologies
[
edit
]
As innovation drives economic growth, and large economic rewards come from new inventions, a great deal of resources (funding and effort) go into the development of emerging technologies.  Some of the sources of these resources are described below.
Research and development
[
edit
]
Research and development
is directed towards the advancement of technology in general, and therefore includes development of emerging technologies.
See also
List of countries by research and development spending
.
Applied research
is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science. It accesses and uses some part of the research communities' (the academia's) accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often state-, business-, or client-driven purpose.
Science policy
is the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science and research enterprise, including the funding of science, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.
Patents
[
edit
]
Top 30 AI patent applicants in 2016
Patents
provide inventors with a limited period of time (minimum of 20 years, but duration based on jurisdiction) of exclusive right in the making, selling, use, leasing or otherwise of their novel technological inventions.
Artificial intelligence
, robotic inventions, new material, or blockchain platforms may be patentable, the patent protecting the technological know-how used to create these inventions.
[37]
In 2019,
WIPO
reported that
AI
was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of number of patent applications and granted patents, the
Internet of things
was estimated to be the largest in terms of market size. It was followed, again in market size, by big data technologies, robotics, AI, 3D printing and the fifth generation of mobile services (5G).
[38]
Since AI emerged in the 1950s, 340000 AI-related patent applications were filed by innovators and 1.6 million scientific papers have been published by researchers, with the majority of all AI-related patent filings published since 2013. Companies represent 26 out of the top 30 AI patent applicants, with universities or public research organizations accounting for the remaining four.
[39]
DARPA
[
edit
]
The
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
is an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.
DARPA was created in 1958 as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements.
Projects funded by DARPA have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as the
Internet
and Global Positioning System technology.
Technology competitions and awards
[
edit
]
There are awards that provide incentive to push the limits of technology (generally synonymous with emerging technologies).  Note that while some of these awards reward achievement after-the-fact via analysis of the merits of technological breakthroughs, others provide incentive via competitions for awards offered for goals yet to be achieved.
The
Orteig Prize
was a $25,000 award offered in 1919 by French hotelier
Raymond Orteig
for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris.  In 1927, underdog
Charles Lindbergh
won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the
Spirit of St. Louis
.  In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.
The XPRIZE series of awards, public competitions designed and managed by the non-profit organization called the
X Prize Foundation
, are intended to encourage technological development that could benefit mankind. The most high-profile XPRIZE to date was the $10,000,000 Ansari XPRIZE relating to spacecraft development, which was awarded in 2004 for the development of
SpaceShipOne
.
The
Turing Award
is an annual prize given by the
Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community." It is stipulated that the contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, and in 2014 grew to $1,000,000.
The
Millennium Technology Prize
is awarded once every two years by
Technology Academy Finland
, an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the Finnish state in partnership.  The first recipient was
Tim Berners-Lee
, inventor of the
World Wide Web
.
In 2003,
David Gobel
seed-funded the
Methuselah Mouse Prize
(Mprize) to encourage the development of new life extension therapies in mice, which are genetically similar to humans. So far, three Mouse Prizes have been awarded: one for breaking longevity records to Dr. Andrzej Bartke of
Southern Illinois University
; one for late-onset rejuvenation strategies to Dr. Stephen Spindler of the
University of California
; and one to Dr. Z. Dave Sharp for his work with the pharmaceutical rapamycin.
Role of science fiction

Main article:
Technology in science fiction
Science fiction
has often affected
innovation
and new technology - for example many rocketry pioneers were inspired by science fiction
[40]
- and the documentary
How William Shatner Changed the World
gives a number of examples of imagined technologies being actualized.
In the media
[
edit

"bleeding edge" redirects here. For other uses, see
bleeding edge (disambiguation)
.
The term
bleeding edge
has been used to refer to some new technologies, formed as an
allusion
to the similar terms "
leading edge
" and "
cutting edge
". It tends to imply even greater advancement, albeit at an increased risk because of the unreliability of the
software
or
hardware
.
[41]
The first documented example of this term being used dates to early 1983, when an unnamed banking executive was quoted to have used it in reference to
Storage Technology Corporation
.

Timing and contextual background of revelation
[
edit
]
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (
asbāb al-nuzūl
), it is an earlier "
Meccan surah
", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.
According to some, it follows
sūrah 94
in the chronological order of the Quran.
[8]
Theme and subject matter
[
edit
]
This sura teaches that all human beings are in loss, except those who have
iman
(faith in Islam), do righteous deeds and remind others of the
Haqq
(
truth
,
rights
,
reality
) and remind others of
Sabr
(
patience
).
[9]
The text of the Sura can be translated as the following:
1.|وَالْعَصْرِ‌
By time (it explain that God swears By time).
2.
إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ
‌
Indeed man is in loss,
3.
إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ‌
‌
except those who have faith and do righteous deeds, and enjoin one another to [follow] the truth, and enjoin one another to patience.
Importance
[
edit
]
This sura is considered the summary of whole Quran by almost all notable classical and modern Islamic scholars including
Imam Shafi
,
Ibn Kathir
,
Israr Ahmed
and
Farhat Hashmi
.
Ibn Kathir
, a traditional exegete, holds that this
sura
is a warning to believers not to waste time or they could be humiliated or even ruined.
[10]
Imam Shafi
, a jurist and traditional scholar of Islam, held that if God had only revealed this surah it would have been sufficient for the guidance of all humankind.
[11]
It summarized the very essence of the Qur'anic message. Thus, Imam Shafi’i asserts that if one followed its counsel, it was enough for humankind to achieve success in life.
[12]
Sayyid Qutb
, a modern exegete of the Qur'an, asserts that this surah outlines a complete system for human life based on an Islamic viewpoint. He says that it defines, in the clearest and most concise form, the basic concept of faith in the context of its comprehensive reality.
[13]
He further says that he is gravely shocked to see the loss and ruin in which humanity finds itself. He is critical of Muslims and non-Muslims and particularly witnessing that humankind is turning away from the goodness that God has bestowed upon it. He is confident that the guidance of this surah is what made the early Muslim great as it can do for those that follow it in the long history of humanity. He says that once the early Arabs were aroused by such surahs, they quickly burst the bounds of Arabia and zealously worked toward the salvation of humanity.
[14]
Al-Tabarani
:
when humankind finds itself at a loss; it can revive itself by returning to the formula provided by the third verse and the four principles/conditions, which are adhered to as a foundation. We saw how these four principles operated on both physical and spiritual levels. This is probably the reason why the companions of the Prophet did not want to become heedless of the foundational message of
Islam
. Consequently, they used to meet one another and only depart until one of them recited surat-Al-Asr to the other and they bid peace upon one another.
[15]
All these exegetes offer a terse reminder of the importance of time and care in its utilization.
Commentary
[
edit
]
Abul Ala Maududi
:
This Surah is a matchless specimen of comprehensiveness and brevity. A whole world of meaning has been compressed into its few brief words, which is too vast in content to be fully expressed even in a book. In it, in a clear and plain way it has been stated what is the way to true success for man and what is the way to ruin and destruction for him.
Imam Shafi
has very rightly said that if the people only considered this Surah well, it alone would suffice them for their guidance.
Al-Tabarani
:
How important this Surah was in the sight of the Companions can be judged from the tradition cited from Abdullah bin Hisn ad-Darimi Abu Madinah, according to which whenever any two of them met they would not part company until they had recited Surah Al-Asr to each other.
Mufti Muhammad Shafi
:
the Struggle of the human being is like the one who is trying to sell ice. It is melting away and he needs to sell it quickly and make as much sales before the end of the day comes. Otherwise - all his valuables' and efforts will go to waste. [In the past - there were no Freezers, so your ice would melt into water by the end of the day.]
Tafsir al-Mazhari
: The taNween ن at the end of KhusriN makes it an INCREDIBLE Loss. Al Insaan - (lil Jins - to all human beings) - there is no exception - the entire category. A universal statement. The statement directly targets you.
Al-Zamakhshari
:
People are in tremendous loss because of that which they buy and sell in life (of good and bad), except for the Saaliheen (righteous). O Allah, make us of the Saliheen (righteous), ameen. Because the Saliheen buy for the next life instead of for the pleasures of this life. And then they were profitable and happy on Judgment Day, and whoever was an enemy to their buying - then he was in loss and despair.
Muhammad ash-Shawkani
:
Every human is in a state of buying and selling than others. He exhausts his ages (youth, middle age, seniority etc.) in purchasing Allah's pleasure. Rushing in gathering Allah's reward. Also refer to
tafsir
sura
at-Takathur
.
Al-Akhfash al-Akbar
said: - Khusr [loss] means Halaka حالك [violent death]. Mawt موت  - general death. So the disbeliever is setting himself up for a violent death by being in this loss.
Ibn Taymiyyah
:
(as quoted by
Muhammad Shafi Deobandi
' in
Maariful Quran
): Humanity is kept from accepting the truth of Islam by 2 obstacles; 1 - Shubuhaat (Doubts) and 2 - Shahawaat (Temptations). Either one of these lead people astray.
[16]
It is an intellectual problem (people feel answers by callers to Islam are not satisfactory). It is a psychological problem (people want to follow forbidden desires).
Shah Waliullah:
in At-Tadhkeer bi ayyaamillah - Remembrance of the Days of Allah. By Allah saying; Wa-al 'Asr - We will remember the special Days of Allah. The Days when; Allah created the human being (
Adam in Islam
), the Day He revealed the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad, the Day Allah drowned the disbelievers of
Prophet Nuh
, the Day Allah destroyed Pharaoh and saved Moses, the Day of Badr, the Day when Allah spoke to
Musa
. The
Day of Judgment
, the Day the believers will see Allah. By saying al 'Asr - we will remember these Days so we will not want to be in loss.
Ibn Kathir
:
Aladheena aamanoo (believe - with their hearts),
wa 'amilu as-salihaat
(do good deeds - with their limbs), and they enjoin each other to the truth by doing and enjoining on others to do acts of obedience and to abandon all that is forbidden, and they enjoin each other to perseverance against all calamities and they held to and advised to Emaan with perseverance whenever they were tortured for enjoining the truth.
Muhammad Ash-Shanqeeti:
Tawwaassu bil haq - telling each other about the
truth
after doing good deeds. The 'amil as-saalihaat was good deeds - general ('aam), and enjoining the truth was khaas (specific).
Al-Zamakhshari
:
Watawaasu bis-sabr (enjoin upon each other perseverance) -
Sabr
over whatever Allah tests His slave with, perseverance in obedience to Allah, and in times of temptation. Allah put Sabr at the end and
haqq
first, and enjoining the haqq as more important. And more noble.
Muhammad Ash-Shanqeeti:
As-Sabireen - whenever a situation of patience is required - this person is patient. Through all circumstances.

Fall River Government Center
This is a
list of mayors of the City of Fall River, Massachusetts,
from 1854 to present.
Fall River
was led by a three-member
Board of Selectmen
from 1803 until its re-incorporation as a city in 1854.
From 1854 until 1902, mayoral elections were held every year and
mayors
served one-year terms. In 1902, the mayoral term was increased to two years, which lasted until the city charter was changed in 1965. That year, the mayoral term was again increased, this time to a four-year term. This change would be overturned by voters in 1973 and a two-year term was reinstated.
The mayor's office is located at
Fall River Government Center
.
Mayoral chronology
[

As of March 2019
, there have been 44 mayors and three acting mayors. Non-consecutive terms by the same person are counted separately (for example,

Fariba Adelkhah
(born 25 April 1959) is a French-Iranian
anthropologist
and academic at
Sciences Po
who was detained in
Iran
from 2019 until 2023.
Early life and career
[
edit
]
Born in
Tehran
, Adelkhah studied in
France
, first at
Université Strasbourg II
and then at the
School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences
.
[1]
In 1990, she obtained a "very honourable" mention for her
Ph.D.
thesis on women in Iran, "an anthropological approach of post-revolutionary Iran: the case of Islamic women" (
Une approche anthropologique de l'Iran post-révolutionnaire. Le cas des femmes islamiques
), with Jean-Pierre Digard as her advisor. Since 2004, she has been a Research Director at the
Fondation nationale des sciences politiques
. As a researcher at the Centre for International Research of
Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po)
, she authored a number of publications on
Iran
and
Afghanistan
.
[2]
She is a member of the scientific council of the periodical
Iranian Studies
and of
Revue des mondes musulmans et de la Méditerranée
.
[3]
Imprisonment in Iran
[
edit
]
On 14 July 2019,
Persian
-language media from outside of Iran reported that she had been arrested in Iran.
[4]
Her arrest would date back to 7 June, when she last connected to her
WhatsApp
account. The Iranian Human Rights website
Gozaar
stated that she had been arrested by the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
and was being detained at
Evin Prison
.
[2]
French authorities stated that Adelkhah was being denied access to consular assistance,
[5]
and are demanding access to their citizen.
[6]
[7]
[8]
In June 2019, Adelkhah's Sciences Po colleague
Roland Marchal
was also arrested in Iran when he came to visit her.
[9]
On 7 February 2020, their lawyer said the two had petitioned prison authorities to allow them to get married.
[10]
Marchal and Adelkhah were reportedly to go on trial on 3 March 2020 but it was postponed due to
COVID-19 pandemic in Iran
.
[11]
Marchal was released on 20 March 2020 as part of a prisoner swap, but no verdict was reached on the case of Adelkhah.
[12]
On 16 May 2020, the 15th Chamber of the Tehran Court sentenced Adelkhah to five years' imprisonment for conspiring against national security, and one year for propaganda against the state.
[13]
During her trial, she was represented by Iranian lawyer Saeid Dehghan. Although Adelkhah is French-Iranian, Iran does not recognise this dual citizenship, and so continues to deny her access to French consular services.
Sciences Po is in contact with the French
Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs
to campaign and raise awareness for Adelkhah's release.
[14]
On 12 January 2022, Adelkhah's Paris-based support group, announced that her house arrest was over and she had been re-imprisoned at Evin.
[15]
She was released from Evin prison again on 10 February 2023.
[16]
[17]
In October 2023, Adelkhah returned to Paris and was welcomed at Sciences Po on October 20.

History
[

According to Zoleveke (1981) during WW2 the main United States Marine Corps HQ was located at Tanaghai where the mission station is situated.
[2]
During the tensions the women peace-builders played an active role, particularly at Tanaghai:
"When we came up there were shootings but we just went up. When we got to the Banker then one of the Commanders asked the militants to put their guns down, so the militants did and we prayed and shared God's word together. After the prayer, the Commander thanked us and then we shook hands and we were all very emotional and cried. One of their Commanders said 'thank you very much to you all mums for the sharing'. One of the things the Commander said was to pray for the GRA militants, but we said to them we already did on our way to you and of course we will always pray for both groups."

Area of Los Angeles, California
This article is about the 90210 area of Los Angeles. For the historic 20th-century post office building in Beverly Hills itself, see
Beverly Hills Main Post Office
.
The old
Beverly Hills Main Post Office
, 469 N. Crescent Dr. at
Santa Monica Boulevard
in
Beverly Hills
, served Beverly Hills and the BHPO area of Los Angeles from 1934 to the 1990s.
Warner Avenue School
Emerson Middle School
University High School
Beverly Hills Post Office
(BHPO) is the name given to a section of
Los Angeles, California
, that lies within the
90210
ZIP code
, assigned to the Beverly Hills Post Office. Los Angeles mailing addresses with the ZIP code 90210 may be written as "Beverly Hills, CA 90210", though the properties themselves lie outside of the
Beverly Hills
city limits.
Description
[
edit
]
Beverly Hills Post Office (BHPO) is a neighborhood in
Los Angeles, California
, that is adjacent to the city of
Beverly Hills
. Because the
United States Postal Service
in Beverly Hills serves the neighborhood, residents have a Beverly Hills mailing address with
zip code 90210
, while other wealthy neighborhoods
Bel Air
and
Holmby Hills
have Los Angeles mailing addresses. While the Beverly Hills connection makes BHPO—about one-third the size of the city—attractive, land is available in larger sizes, and with lower prices, better views, and more seclusion, than in Beverly Hills itself.
[1]
The BHPO area itself contains a number of neighborhoods, including
Benedict Canyon
and
Coldwater Canyon
.
[2]
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The
Los Angeles Times
wrote in 2004, "When Beverly Hills was incorporated in 1914, the northern border was roughly one mile (1.6 km) north of
Sunset Boulevard
, with the exception of Trousdale Estates. The remaining section stretching north to
Mulholland Drive
was left as part of the hills of Los Angeles, where it remained anonymous for decades".
[3]
In the 1920s, the federal government decided to have the Beverly Hills post office serve the area now known as BHPO, which was then a rural area, much of it part of Doheny Ranch. By the 1940s people bought BHPO homes because they were less expensive than in Beverly Hills, despite higher property taxes.
[1]
In 1963, the area was included within the 90210 ZIP Code, which also covers the northern part of Beverly Hills.
[3]
Property taxes were higher in Los Angeles than in Beverly Hills until
1978 California Proposition 13
equalized property taxes, making BHPO more attractive.
[1]
Post Office
[
edit
]
The
ZIP Code
90210 is still handled by the Beverly Hills Main Post Office. The original
Beverly Hills Main Post Office
from 1934 to the 1990s still sits at 469 North Crescent Drive in the
Beverly Hills Civic Center
, and was added to the
National Register of Historic Places
in 1985.
[4]
[5]
In 1990, 325 North Maple Street was rebuilt as the new Beverly Hills Main Post Office; the old Main on Crescent Drive was closed in 1999 when the building was sold back to the City of Beverly Hills.
[4]
[5]
Beverly Hills has other Post Offices in other ZIP Codes as well.
City services
[
edit
]
BHPO residents do not have access to
Beverly Hills Police Department
, Beverly Hills Fire Department or any Beverly Hills city services.
[1]
As citizens of the city of Los Angeles, they receive Los Angeles city services and vote in Los Angeles elections. This can cause problems with emergency response. For example, when actress
Demi Moore
needed an ambulance in January 2012, Beverly Hills and Los Angeles
9-1-1
operators used over two minutes to determine jurisdiction for her home.

The
Barton-Zard reaction
is a route to
pyrrole
derivatives via the reaction of a nitroalkene with an α-isocyanoacetate under basic conditions.
[1]
It is named after
Derek Barton
and
Samir Zard
who first reported it in 1985.
[2]
Mechanism
[
edit
]
The mechanism consists of five steps:
Base catalyzed carbonyl
enolization
of the α-
isocyanide
.
Michael-type addition
between the α-
isocyanide
carbonyl enolate and the nitroalkene.
5-endo-dig
cyclization
(see:
Baldwin's rules
).
Base catalyzed elimination of the nitro group.
Tautomerization leading to
aromatisation
.
Scope
[
edit
]
The nitro compound may be aromatic rather than just an alkene.
[3]
The reaction has been used for the synthesis of polypyrroles, including
porphyrins
,
[4]
as well as dipyrromethenes such as
BODIPY
.

The
1972-73
Memphis Tams season
was the 1st season of the Tams and 3rd overall season of
American Basketball Association
basketball in Memphis. After two seasons as the
Memphis Pros
with middling profits, Charles O. Finley bought the team on June 13, 1972. He proceeded to rebrand the team like his other teams that he had owned (the
Oakland Athletics
and the
Oakland Seals
), changing the colors of the team to Kelly Green, California Gold, and Polar Bear White. The team's name was picked from an array of 20,000 postcards sent by fans, with the winner being given a $2,500 prize, which turned out to be Tams. Tams was meant to stand for the fans that resided in
Tennessee
,
Arkansas
, and
Mississippi
, with a tam-o-shanter hat being the main logo. In fact during the first ever game on October 12, 1972, the entire team came out wearing the hats. Finley also had a hand in the combinations of uniform colors worn, in part due to there every top and trunk being either green, gold, or white, with one notable combo being yellow tops with white trunks. For all of the flair the team had with uniforms, it did not translate into success on the court nor for attendance. By December, Finley tried to have negotiations to move the team to St. Paul, Minnesota, and
Ron Franz
was cut before Christmas. The Tams were 6th in points scored at 111.5 per game but were dead last in points allowed at 118.1 per game. They had two instances of 10 game losing streaks, with the Tams going a month between wins, losing 15 straight games from February 25 to March 24. By the time the streak ended, they had been eliminated from making the playoffs. They were the first team to lose 60 games since the Miami Floridians in 1969.

A map of North America's physical, political, and population characteristics as of 2018
North America
is a
continent
[b]
in the
Northern
and
Western Hemispheres
.
[c]
North America is bordered to the north by the
Arctic Ocean
, to the east by the
Atlantic Ocean
, to the southeast by
South America
and the
Caribbean Sea
, and to the west and south by the
Pacific Ocean
. The region includes
Bermuda
,
Canada
, the
Caribbean
,
Central America
,
Greenland
,
Mexico
,
Saint Pierre and Miquelon
, and the
United States
.
North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), representing approximately 16.5% of the
Earth
's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after
Asia
and
Africa
, and the
fourth-largest continent by population
after Asia, Africa, and
Europe
. As of 2013
, North America's population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in
23 independent states
, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In
human geography
and in the
English-speaking world
outside the United States, particularly in Canada, the terms "North America" and "North American" are typically defined as including just Canada and the United States.
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
The
first human populations
reached North America during the
Last Glacial Period
approximately 20,000 to 17,000 years ago, during which they crossed the
Bering land bridge
in the
Bering Strait
on their way to reaching North America. The
Paleo-Indian
period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the
Archaic period
began. The
classic stage
followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD,
the Norse
were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.
In 1492, the exploratory voyages of
Christopher Columbus
led to
a transatlantic exchange
, including
migrations
of
European settlers
during the
Age of Discovery
and the
early modern period
. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists,
indigenous peoples
,
African slaves
, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.
Europe's colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, including
English
,
Spanish
, and
French
, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect
Western traditions
. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.
Name

Naming of the Americas
,
New Spain
,
Turtle Island (Native American folklore)
, and
Vinland
A 1621 map of North America
The
Americas
were named after the Italian explorer
Amerigo Vespucci
by
German
cartographers
Martin Waldseemüller
and
Matthias Ringmann
.
[12]
Vespucci explored
South America
between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass not then known to Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller published a world map, and placed the word "America" on the continent of present-day South America.
[13]
The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias.
[14]
On a 1553 world map published by
Petrus Apianus
,
[15]
North America was called "Baccalearum", meaning "realm of the Cod fish", in reference to the abundance of
cod fish
on the
East Coast
.
[16]
Waldseemüller used the
Latin
version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of "America", following the examples of "Europa", "Asia", and "Africa". Map makers later extended the name America to North America.
In 1538,
Gerardus Mercator
used the term America on his world map of the entire
Western Hemisphere
.
[17]
On
his subsequent 1569 map
, Mercator called North America "America or New India" (
America sive India Nova
).
[18]
The
Spanish Empire
called its territories in North and South America "Las Indias", and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the
Council of the Indies
.
Definitions
A 2005
NASA
satellite image of North America
The
United Nations
and its statistics division recognize North America as including three regions: Northern America,
Central America
, and the
Caribbean
.
[19]
"Northern America" is a distinct term from "North America", excluding
Central America
, which itself
may or may not
include
Mexico
. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
France
,
Italy
,
Portugal
,
Spain
,
Romania
,
Greece
, and the countries of
Latin America
use a
six-continent model
, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and
North America
designating a subcontinent comprising
Canada
, the
United States
, Mexico, and
Saint Pierre and Miquelon
(politically part of France), and often including
Greenland
and
Bermuda
.

Regions
Further information:
List of regions of Canada
and
List of regions of the United States
North America includes several regions and subregions, each of which have their own respective cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th and 21st century trade agreements, including
NAFTA
between
Canada
,
Mexico
, and the
United States
, and
CAFTA
between
Central America
, the
Dominican Republic
, and the United States.
North America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions,
Anglo-America
and
Latin America
. Anglo-America includes most of North America,
Belize
, and
Caribbean
islands with
English
-speaking populations, though subnational entities, including
Louisiana
and
Quebec
, have large
Francophone
populations; in
Quebec
,
French
is the official language.
[26]
.
The southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English speaking Caribbean nations.
[27]
[28]
The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term "North America" is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S.
[29]
[30]
[31]
[32]
[33]
The term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S.,
Bermuda
, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon.
[34]
[35]
Although the term does not refer to a unified region,
[36]
Middle America
includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.
[37]
North America's largest countries by land area are Canada and the U.S., both of which have well-defined and recognized subregions. In Canada, these include (from east to west)
Atlantic Canada
,
Central Canada
,
Canadian Prairies
, the
British Columbia Coast
, and
Northern Canada
. In the U.S., they include
New England
, the
Mid-Atlantic
,
South Atlantic states
,
East North Central states
,
West North Central states
,
East South Central states
,
West South Central states
,
Mountain states
, and
Pacific states
. The
Great Lakes region
and the
Pacific Northwest
include areas in both Canada and the U.S.

North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the
Western Hemisphere
, the Americas, or simply America, which, in many countries, is considered a single continent
[40]
[41]
[42]
with North America a
subcontinent
.
[43]
[44]
[45]
North America is the third-largest continent by area after
Asia
and
Africa
.
[46]
[47]
North America's only land connection to
South America
is in present-day
Panama
at the
Darien Gap
on the
Colombia
-Panama border, placing almost all of Panama within North America.
[48]
[49]
[50]
Alternatively, some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec
, Mexico, with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point.
[51]
The Caribbean islands, or West Indies, are considered part of North America.
[44]
The continental coastline is long and irregular. The
Gulf of Mexico
is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by
Hudson Bay
. Others include the
Gulf of Saint Lawrence
and the
Gulf of California
.
Before the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the
West Indies
delineate a submerged former
land bridge
, which had connected North and South America via what are now
Florida
and
Venezuela
.
There are several islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the
Bahamas
,
Turks & Caicos
, the
Greater
and
Lesser Antilles
, the
Aleutian Islands
(some of which are in the
Eastern Hemisphere
proper), the
Alexander Archipelago
, the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the
world's largest
, is on the same
tectonic plate
(the
North American Plate
) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge
over 100
million years ago
(mya). The nearest landmass to it is
Cape Hatteras
,
North Carolina
. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to
Virginia
and other parts of the continent.
The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of
California
, including the cities of
San Diego
,
Los Angeles
, and
Santa Cruz
, lie on the eastern edge of the
Pacific Plate
, with the two plates meeting along the
San Andreas fault
. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the
Caribbean Plate
, whereas the
Juan de Fuca
and
Cocos plates
border the North American Plate on its western frontier.
The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the
Great Plains
stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Canadian Arctic
; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the
Rocky Mountains
, the
Great Basin
,
California
and
Alaska
; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long
plateaus
and
cordilleras
, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.
The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the
coast ranges
in
California
,
Oregon
,
Washington
, and
British Columbia
, with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is
Denali
in Alaska.
The
U.S. Geographical Survey
(USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is "6 miles [10 km] west of
Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota
" at about
, about 24 kilometers (15 mi) from
Rugby, North Dakota
. The USGS further states that "No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 states, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent."
[52]
Nonetheless, there is a 4.6-meter (15 ft) field stone
obelisk
in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American
continental pole of inaccessibility
is located 1,650 km (1,030 mi) from the nearest coastline, between
Allen
and
Kyle, South Dakota
at
.

Geology
Main article:
Geology of North America
Geologic history
The principal water divisions in
Canada
, the
United States
, and
Mexico
Laurentia
is an ancient
craton
which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the
Proterozoic
eon.
[54]
The
Canadian Shield
is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late
Paleozoic
to Early
Mesozoic
eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent
Pangaea
, with
Eurasia
to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the
Appalachian Mountains
, which
formed
some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of
Laurasia
, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-
Cretaceous
period.
[55]
The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the
Laramide orogeny
, between 80 and 55 mya. The formation of the
Isthmus of Panama
that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 mya,
[56]
and the
Great Lakes
(as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.
North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about
geologic time
periods.
[57]
The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of
dinosaurs
than any other modern country.
[57]
According to
paleontologist
Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.
[57]
Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.
[57]
The most significant
Late Jurassic
dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the
Morrison Formation
of the western U.S.
[58]
Canada
Main article:
Canada
A geologic map of North America published by the
U.S. Geographical Survey
Canada
is geographically one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of
Precambrian
rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the
Palaeozoic
era.
[59]
Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.
[59]
Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel,
zinc
, copper, gold, lead,
molybdenum
, and
uranium
reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,
[60]
making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield, there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is
Sudbury
, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the
Sudbury Basin
is an ancient
meteorite
impact crater
. The nearby, but less known
Temagami Magnetic Anomaly
has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.
[61]
The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.

Central America
Main article:
Central America
Central America
rests on the
Caribbean Plate
.
Central America
is geologically active with
volcanic eruptions
and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by
a major earthquake
, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one
earthquake
devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in
Honduras
a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.
Volcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the
Arenal Volcano
, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.
Central America has many
mountain ranges
; the longest are the
Sierra Madre de Chiapas
, the
Cordillera Isabelia
, and the
Cordillera de Talamanca
. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.
Climate
A Köppen climate classification map of North America
North America is a very large continent that extends from north of the
Arctic Circle
to south of the
Tropic of Cancer
. Greenland, along with the
Canadian Shield
, is
tundra
with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F), but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the
Great Lakes
.
Climate west of the
Cascade Range
is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation 20 inches (510 millimeters).
[62]
Climate in coastal California is described to be
Mediterranean
, with average temperatures in cities like
San Francisco
ranging from 57 to 70 °F (14 to 21 °C) over the course of the year.
[63]
Stretching from the
East Coast
to eastern
North Dakota
, and stretching down to
Kansas
, is the
humid continental climate
featuring intense seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places like
New York City
averaging 50 in (1,300 mm).
[64]
Starting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the
Gulf of Mexico
(whilst encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the
humid subtropical climate
. This area has the wettest cities in the
contiguous U.S.
, with annual precipitation reaching 67 in (1,700 mm) in
Mobile, Alabama
.
[65]
Stretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates, and going west to the
Sierra Nevada
, south to the southern tip of
Durango
, north to the border with tundra climate, the
steppe
/
desert
climates are the driest in the United States.
[66]
Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent, where
subtropical
or
temperate climates
occur just below the tropics, as in central
Mexico
and
Guatemala
.
Tropical climates
appear in the
island
regions and in the subcontinent's bottleneck, found in countries and states bathed by the
Caribbean Sea
or to the south of the
Gulf of Mexico
and the
Pacific Ocean
.
[67]
Precipitation patterns vary across the region, and as such
rainforest
,
monsoon
, and
savanna
types can be found, with rains and high temperatures throughout the year.

The
indigenous peoples of the Americas
have many
creation myths
by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation,
[68]
but there is no evidence that humans evolved there.
[69]
The specifics of the initial
settlement of the Americas
by ancient Asians are subject to ongoing research and discussion.
[70]
The traditional theory has been that hunters entered the
Bering Land Bridge
between eastern
Siberia
and present-day
Alaska
from 27,000 to 14,000 years ago.
[71]
[72]
[h]
A growing viewpoint is that the first American inhabitants sailed from Beringia some 13,000 years ago,
[74]
with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the
Last Glacial Period
, in what is known as the
Late Glacial Maximum
, around 12,500 years ago.
[75]
The oldest
petroglyphs
in North America date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present.

[78]
[79]
[80]
Prior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America, the
natives of North America
were divided into many different polities, ranging from small
bands
of a few families to large empires. They lived in several
culture areas
, which roughly correspond to
geographic and biological zones
that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the
bison
hunters
of the
Great Plains
and the farmers of
Mesoamerica
. Native groups also are classified by their
language families
, which included
Athapascan
and
Uto-Aztecan
languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same
material culture
, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the
Inuit
of the high
Arctic
arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of
Dorset culture
artifacts from the
archaeological record
and their replacement by the
Thule people
.
During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest yet discovered is the
Clovis culture
(c. 9550-9050 BCE) in modern
New Mexico
.
[77]
Later groups include the
Mississippian culture
and related
Mound building
cultures, found in the
Mississippi River
valley and the
Pueblo culture
of what is now the
Four Corners
. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the
domestication
of many common
crops
now used around the world, such as tomatoes,
squash
, and
maize
. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many other cultural advances were made there. The
Mayans
developed a
writing system
, built
huge pyramids and temples
, had a
complex calendar
, and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE.
[81]
The first recorded European references to North America are in
Norse sagas
where it is referred to as
Vinland
.
[82]
The earliest verifiable instance of
pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact
by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around 1000 CE.
[83]
The site
, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named
Newfoundland
, has provided unmistakable evidence of
Norse
settlement.
[84]
Norse explorer
Leif Erikson
(c. 970-1020 CE) is thought to have visited the area.
[j]
Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent (excluding Greenland).
[86]
[87]
The Mayan culture was still present in
southern Mexico
and Guatemala when the Spanish
conquistadors
arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the
Aztec Empire
, whose capital city
Tenochtitlan
was located further north in the
Valley of Mexico
. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by
Hernán Cortés
.

A 1702 map of North America showing forts, towns, and (in solid colors) areas occupied by
European colonial settlements
During the so-called
Age of Discovery
, Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America, much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples. Upon Europeans' arrival in the "
New World
", indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The
indigenous population declined
substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as
smallpox
, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of
violent conflicts
with Europeans.
[89]
Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups
died out
, and others changed quite quickly.
On the North America's southeastern coast, Spanish explorer
Juan Ponce de León
, who had accompanied Columbus's second voyage, visited and named in 1513
La Florida
.
[90]
As the colonial period unfolded, Spain, England, and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories in North America eastern and southern coastlines. Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of
Hispaniola
and
Cuba
in the 1490s, building cities, putting the resident indigenous populations to work, raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards. Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork, spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples. An expedition under the command of Spanish settler,
Hernán Cortés
, sailed westward in 1519 to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico. With local indigenous allies, the Spanish
conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico
in 1521. Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico, Central America, and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century. Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas, the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire.
Other European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain, including the Caribbean islands. France took the western half of
Hispaniola
and developed
Saint-Domingue
as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor. Britain took
Barbados
and
Jamaica
, and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain. Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements, since it sought first to control nearby
Ireland
.
English settlements
Main article:
British America
The first permanent English settlement was in
Jamestown, Virginia
in 1607, followed by additional colonial establishments on the
east coast
from present-day
Georgia
in the south to
Massachusetts
in the north, forming the
Thirteen Colonies
of
British America
. The English did not establish settlements north or east of the
St. Lawrence Valley
in present-day Canada until after the conclusion of the
American Revolutionary War
. Britain's early settlements in present-day Canada included
St. John's, Newfoundland
in 1630 and
Halifax, Nova Scotia
in 1749. The first permanent French settlement was in
Quebec City, Quebec
in 1608
Seven Years' War
Main article:
Seven Years' War
With the British victory in the
Seven Years' War
, France in 1763 ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the
Mississippi River
. Spain, in turn, gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi, which then served as a border between Spain and Britain's territorial claims. French colonists settled
Illinois Country
after several generations of experience on North America, migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the
Gulf of Mexico
. These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes, and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the
Pacific Ocean
on the present-day
U.S. West Coast
.
American Revolution
Main articles:
American Revolution
and
American Revolutionary War
In 1776, after various attempts to reconcile differences with the
British
, the
Thirteen Colonies
in British America sent delegates to the
Second Continental Congress
in
Philadelphia
, who unanimously adopted the
Declaration of Independence
on July 4, 1776, written primarily by
Thomas Jefferson
, a member of the
Committee of Five
charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it. In the Declaration, the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy, then governed by
King George III
, and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision. With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the
American Revolutionary War
, which had begun the year before at the
Battles of Lexington and Concord
on April 19, 1775. Gathered in Philadelphia following the war's outbreak, delegates from the thirteen colonies established the
Continental Army
from various
patriot militias
then engaged in resisting the British, and appointed
George Washington
as the Continental Army's military commander.
As the American Revolutionary War progressed, France and Spain, both then enemies of Britain, began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause. The
British Army
, in turn, was supported by
Hessian military
units from present-day
Germany
.
In 1783, after an eight-year attempt to defeat the American rebellion, King George III acknowledged Britain's defeat in the war, leading to the signing of the
Treaty of Paris
on September 3, 1783, which solidified the sovereign establishment of the
United States
.
Westward expansion

Lewis and Clark Expedition
,
Louisiana Purchase
, and
United States Exploring Expedition
By the late 18th century, Russia was established on the
Pacific Northwest
northern coastline, where it was engaged in
maritime fur trade
and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region. As a result, the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline. The first Spanish settlements were attempted in
Alta California
during that period. Numerous overland explorations associated with
voyageurs
,
fur trade
, and U.S. led expeditions, including the
Lewis and Clark
,
Fremont
and
Wilkes
expeditions, reached the Pacific.
In 1803, during the
presidency of Thomas Jefferson
, the third
U.S. president
,
Napoleon Bonaparte
sold France's remaining North American territorial claims, which included regions west of the Mississippi River, to the U.S., in the
Louisiana Purchase
. Spain and the U.S. settled their western boundary dispute in 1819 in the
Adams-Onís Treaty
. Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain, winning it for Mexico (which included Central America at the time) in 1821. The U.S. sought further westward expansion and fought the
Mexican-American War
, gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control. Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples, which did not recognize the claims of Spain, France, or the U.S. Russia sold its North American claims, which included the present-day U.S. state of
Alaska
, to the U.S. in 1867.
Canada and Panama Canal
Main articles:
Canada
and
Panama Canal
In 1867, colonial settlers north of the United States, unified as the dominion of
Canada
. The U.S. sought to dig a canal across the
Isthmus of Panama
in present-day
Panama
in Central America, then a part of present-day
Colombia
. The U.S. aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia. The U.S. subsequently carved out the
Panama Canal Zone
, and claimed sovereignty over it. After decades of work, the
Panama Canal
was completed, which connected the
Atlantic
and
Pacific
oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.

Non-native nations' control and claims over North America,
c.
1750 to 2008
Canada and the United States are the wealthiest and most
developed nations
on the continent followed by Mexico, a
newly industrialized country
.
[91]
The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher
GDP (PPP) per capita
than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher
Human Development Index
and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations.
[92]
Additionally, despite Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.
[93]
Demographically, North America is ethnically diverse. Its three main groups are
Whites
,
Mestizos
and
Blacks
.
[94]
There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and
Asians
among other less numerous groups.
[94]
Languages
Main article:
Languages of North America
Native languages
of the United States, Canada, Greenland, and Northern Mexico
The dominant
languages in North America
are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside
Greenlandic
, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the
Dutch Caribbean
. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the
anglophone
countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the
Commonwealth Caribbean
. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the
Romance languages
, derived from
Latin
, of Spanish and
Portuguese
, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except
Guyana
,
Suriname
,
French Guiana
[France], and the
Falkland Islands
[UK]).
The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of
New Brunswick
. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of
Ontario
(the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of
Manitoba
(co-official as
de jure
with English), the
French West Indies
and
Saint-Pierre et Miquelon
, as well as the U.S. state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both
Creole
and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the
Commonwealth of Dominica
alongside English.
A significant number of
Indigenous languages
are spoken in North America, with 372,000 people in the U.S. speaking an indigenous language at home,
[95]
about 225,000 in Canada
[96]
and roughly 6 million in Mexico.
[97]
In the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 150 surviving indigenous languages of the 300 spoken prior to European contact.
[98]
Religions

Religions of the world
The percentage of people who identify with a religion in North America, according to 2010-2012 data
Christianity
is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. According to a 2012
Pew Research Center
survey, 77% of the population considered themselves
Christians
.
[99]
Christianity also is the predominant religion
in the 23 dependent territories in North America
.
[100]
The U.S. has the
largest Christian population
in the world, with nearly 247 million Christians (70%), although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations.
[101]
Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by
Brazil
.
[102]
According to the same study, the
religiously unaffiliated
(including
agnostics
and
atheists
) make up about 17% of the population of Canada and the U.S.
[103]
Those with no religious affiliation make up about 24% of Canada's total population.
[104]
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico host communities of
Jews
(6 million or about 1.8%),
[105]
Buddhists
(3.8 million or 1.1%)
[106]
and
Muslims
(3.4 million or 1.0%).
[107]
The largest number of Jews can be found in the U.S. (5.4 million),
[108]
Canada (375,000)
[109]
and Mexico (67,476).
[110]
The U.S. hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with 2.7 million or 0.9%,
[111]
[112]
while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or 3.2% of the population.
[113]
In Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims in 2010.
[114]
In 2012,
U-T San Diego
estimated U.S. practitioners of Buddhism at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in
Southern California
.
[115]
The predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity (96%).
[116]
Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century,
Roman Catholicism
was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church. A vast campaign of religious conversion, the so-called "spiritual conquest", was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold. The
Inquisition
was established to assure orthodox belief and practice. The Catholic Church remained an important institution, so that even after political independence, Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly
Protestantism
, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion. Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean (85%).
[116]
Other religious groups in the region are
Hinduism
,
Islam
,
Rastafari
(in Jamaica), and
Afro-American religions
such as
Santería
and
Vodou
.

North America is the
fourth
most populous continent after Asia, Africa, and
Europe
.
[117]
Its most populous country is the U.S. with 329.7 million persons. The second largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3 million.
[118]
Canada is the third most populous country with 37.0 million.
[119]
The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million.
[120]
[121]
[122]
[123]
[124]
Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2,166,000 km
2
or 836,300 mi
2
), and therefore, it has the world's lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km
2
(0.067 pop./mi
2
).
[125]
While the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles,
Toronto
,
[126]
Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and
Montreal
. Cities in the
Sun Belt
regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and
Houston
,
Phoenix
, Miami,
Atlanta
, and
Las Vegas
, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of
Baby Boomers
, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is
Tijuana
, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of
water shortages
.
[127]
Eight of the top ten
metropolitan areas
are
located in the U.S.
These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the
New York City metropolitan area
,
Los Angeles metropolitan area
,
Chicago metropolitan area
, and the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex
.
[128]
Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U.S., Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America:
Greater Mexico City
.
[129]
Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the
Toronto metropolitan area
having six million people.
[130]
The proximity of cities to each other on the
Canada-United States border
and the
Mexico-U.S. border
has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These
urban agglomerations
are observed at their largest and most productive in
Detroit-Windsor
and
San Diego-Tijuana
and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit-Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.
[131]

Megaregions of the United States
North America has also been witness to the growth of
megapolitan areas
. In the U.S. exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the
Arizona Sun Corridor
,
Cascadia
,
Florida
,
Front Range
,
Great Lakes Megalopolis
,
Gulf Coast
,
Northeast
,
Northern California
,
Piedmont Atlantic
,

[133]
Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the
Quebec City-Windsor Corridor
,
Golden Horseshoe
—both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis—and the
Central Mexico megalopolis
. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet
megaregion criterion
have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.

North America's GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world,
[138]
followed by
Oceania
.
[139]
Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. have significant and multifaceted economic systems. The U.S. has the largest economy of all three countries and in the world.
[139]
In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $57,466 according to the
World Bank
, and is the most technologically developed economy of the three.
[140]
The U.S.'s services sector comprises 77% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22% and agriculture comprises 1.2%.
[139]
The U.S. economy is also the fastest growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole,
[141]
[138]
with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well.
[138]
Canada shows significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.
[142]
Canada's per capita GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th largest GDP (nominal) in 2014.
[142]
Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%.
[142]
Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th largest GDP (nominal) in the world.
[143]
Being a
newly industrialized country
,
[91]
Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations.
[144]
Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.
[145]
The North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas.
[146]
These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the
Caribbean Community and Common Market
(CARICOM), and the
Central American Common Market
(CACM).
[146]
Of these trade blocs, the U.S. takes part in two. In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the
Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement
among numerous other
free-trade
relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.
NAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world.
[147]
Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.
[148]
While Canada and the U.S. already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship—and to present day still do—in the world and
Canada-U.S. trade relations
already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs,
[149]
NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar
duty-free
trade. The
free-trade agreement
allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U.S.-Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.
[150]
The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.
[151]
This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010.
[152]
The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other's largest trade partners. The U.S. is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico,
[153]
while Canada and Mexico are each other's third largest trade partners.
[154]
[155]
In 2018, the NAFTA was replaced by the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement
.
The Caribbean trade bloc (CARICOM) came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a
common passport
for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free-trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free-trade agreements have been signed into effect.
Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. The 2006 implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) left the future of the CACM unclear.
[156]
The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the U.S., Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs.
These nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the
G3 Free Trade Agreement
with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the
Transatlantic Free Trade Area
between itself and the
European Union
; the
U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area
between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the
Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership
between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.
Transport
Main article:
Transportation in North America
A 2006 map of the North American
Class I railroad
network
The
Pan-American Highway
route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km (30,000 mi) in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly 26,000 km (16,000 mi).
The first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the
Pacific
coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous
golden spike
event at
Promontory Summit, Utah
, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the
American West
, catalyzing the transition from the
wagon trains
of previous decades to a modern transportation system.
[157]
Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian
Grand Trunk Railway
had, by 1867, already accumulated more than 2,055 km (1,277 mi) of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as
Port Huron, Michigan
, through
Sarnia, Ontario
.
Communications
A shared telephone system known as the
North American Numbering Plan
(NANP) is an integrated
telephone numbering plan
of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its
territories
, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations.
Culture
Baseball
is known as the national pastime of the United States, and is also played in Canada and many Latin American countries.
The cultures of North America are diverse. The U.S. and English Canada have many cultural similarities, while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada, which is protected by law. Since the U.S. was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico, and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U.S.-Mexico border. In the southwest of the U.S. there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism. Mexico and Central America are part of
Latin America
and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America. However, they share with the United States the establishment of post-independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations. Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.
Canada's
constitution
dates to 1867, with confederation, in the British North America Act, but not until 1982 did Canada have the power to amend its own constitution. Canada's Francophone heritage has been enshrined in law since the British parliament passed the
Quebec Act
of 1774. In contrast to largely Protestant Anglo settlers in North America, French-speaking Canadians were Catholic and with the Quebec Act were guaranteed freedom to practice their religion, restored the right of the Catholic Church to impose
tithes
for its support, and established French civil law in most circumstances.
The distinctiveness of French language and culture has been codified in Canadian law, so that both English and French are designated official languages. The U.S. has no official language, but its national language is English.
The Canadian government took action to protect
Canadian culture
by limiting non-
Canadian content
in broadcasting, creating the
Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission
to monitor Canadian content. In Quebec, the provincial government established the
Quebec Office of the French Language
, often called the "language police" by Anglophones, which mandates the use of French terminology and signage in French.
[158]
Since 1968 the unicameral legislature has been called the
Quebec National Assembly
.
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day
, 24 June, is the national holiday of Quebec and celebrated by francophone Canadians throughout Canada. In Quebec, the
school system
was divided into Catholic and Protestant, so-called confessional schools. Anglophone education in Quebec has been increasingly undermined.
[159]
Latino culture
is strong in the southwest of the U.S., as well as Florida, which draws Latin Americans from many countries in the hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of
Monterrey
, Tijuana,
Ciudad Juárez
, and
Mexicali
, is strongly influenced by the
culture
and
way of life of the U.S.
Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most
Americanized
city in Mexico.
[160]
Northern Mexico, the Western U.S. and
Alberta
, Canada share a
cowboy
culture.
The
Anglophone Caribbean states
have witnessed and participated in the decline of the
British Empire
and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people
living abroad
than those remaining at home.

Greenland has experienced many immigration waves from
Northern Canada
, e.g. the
Thule people
. Therefore, Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous peoples of Canada. Greenland is also considered
Nordic
and has strong Danish ties due to
centuries of colonization by Denmark
.

Popular culture - sports
The U.S. and Canada have major sports teams that compete against each other, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer/football. Canada, Mexico and the U.S.

William Digges
(
c.
1721
—1784) was a prominent planter and politician in the
Colony of Virginia
, who represented
Warwick County, Virginia
in the
House of Burgesses
from 1752 until 1771.
[1]
Early and family life
[
edit
]
The second son born to the former Elizabeth Foliott Power and her planter and burgess husband
Cole Digges
, was born to the
First Families of Virginia
. His father would serve for decades on the Virginia Governor's Council (following service in the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly, the House of Burgesses, where many ancestors and cousins had served). His great uncle, also
William Digges
, had served on the Maryland Proprietor's Council after representing York County in the Virginia House of Burgesses (and founded the Maryland branch of the family which also included members of the same name and which intermarried with this branch).
On the maternal side, his grandfather Dr. Henry Power practiced medicine and his great-grandfather John Power was a "Spanish merchant" (presumably trading Virginia tobacco and other products with Spain or its colonies)
[2]
and his other great-grandfather Rev. Folliott had a parish which merged with Williamsburg's
parish
. His elder brother
Edward Digges
inherited their ancestral plantation of
Bellfield
in York County, and represented that county in the House of Burgesses before moving westward and leaving that plantation in the care of his eldest son (also
William Digges
, 1742-1804, who would marry this man's daughter Elizabeth and represent Warwick County in the Virginia House of Delegates). Their eldest sister Mary (1717-1744) married Nathanial Harrison of Brandon plantation slightly upstream on the James River and their sister Susannah in 1739 married Major Benjamin Harrison, son of Nathaniel Harrison of Wakefield plantation.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
Like his father, uncles and grandfather, Digges was a planter. He used enslaved labor to operate
Denbigh plantation
in Warwick County. Following the conflict, he submitted claims for suppluing fodder, corn and beeves to the French and Continental armies.
[3]
In 1783, he and his son (or nephew through his brother Dudley) Cole owned 44 titheable Blacks and 43 young enslaved, as well as 21 horses, 102 cattle, a stud horse and a carriage. Their holdings were second largest number of enslaved people in Warwick county, exceeded only by 55 Blacks and 66 young enslaved, 17 horses, 3 cattle, a carriage and a coach owned by
Wilson Miles Cary
, with Richard Cary and Edward Harwood also owning significant numbers of enslaved in that Tidewater County.
[4]
Probably reflecting his demise, in 1785, only Mariah, Beck and Metne were listed as owned by him in Warwick County (as well as untitheable, although a horse and two cattle were taxed).
[5]
During the colonial period Digges also served as a justice of the peace in Warwick County, and as a vestryman of Warwick parish.
[6]
Warwick County voters first elected him as one of the burgesses representing their small county in 1752, and re-elected him and William Harwood until 1772, when William Langhorne succeeded him.
[7]
Digges experienced financial problems after the American Revolutionary War, particularly since his main plantations were near the final fighting at Yorktown in 1781, and probably worn out from years of nutrient intensive tobacco farming. Also, he may have wished to provide dowries for his daughters. While residing at
Mayfield Cottage
upstream in
Dinwiddie County
in 1783 and 1784, Digges advertised for overseers to operate Denbigh Plantation.
[8]
[9]
In November 1784, he advertised Mayfield plantation, described as including 400 acres, for sale.
[10]
The following year, William Digges Jr. and Dudley Digges Jr. advertised for sale between 600 and 800 acres near "New-Port-News", possibly Denbigh plantation.
[11]
Personal life
[
edit
]
This William Digges married twice. His first wife, Frances Robinson, the daughter of Major Anthony Robinson and his wife Diana, bore at least two sons, Cole and William. However, they also had first cousins (this man's nephews through his elder brother Edward) who shared the same names, so genealogies may have become confused. According to the modern genealogist John Dorman, their firstborn son Cole Digges (1754-1817) served as a cavalry major in the Revolutionary War and member of the House of Delegates before moving westward to
Hanover County
, while his brother William remained in the Newport News area even after selling Denbigh plantation in 1787 following this man's death. Complicating matters, his brother Dudley also had a son named Cole Digges, who like this man's son (his cousin) served as an officer in the American Revolutionary War, but died of combat related wounds in 1777. In any event, of their daughters, Susanna married William Cole, Frances did not marry, Elizabeth married her cousin William Digges, Mary married William Hill of Newport News and Lucy married John Walton of Northampton County.
[6]
However, the much earlier genealogist
Lyon Gardiner Tyler
claims the eldest brother Edward never married and this man moved to Fauquier County and had sons William, Dudley, Thomas and Edward in Fauquier County.
[1]
Death and legacy
[
edit
]
Digges died, probably in late 1784, and his burial place is now unknown. In 1787, Dr. William Young purchased part of Denbigh plantation in Warwick County from William Digges, probably this man's nephew and son-in-law. for the next century and a half it remained in the hands of Young descendants (who defended it against invading British troops in the War of 1812 and bought the rest of the property in 1813).
[12]
Young descendants continued to operate it during the Civil War and the development of Newport News as a shipping terminal, although part had become a city farm by 1961 and in 1963, shortly after Warwick County was merged into the independent city, a redevelopment authority purchased Denbigh and developed as residential housing neighborhood after archeological excavations.

Super 8 (Music from the Motion Picture)
is the
score album
composed by
Michael Giacchino
for the 2011 film
of the same name
directed by
J. J. Abrams
. The album was released on June 13, 2011 by
Varèse Sarabande
featuring 33 tracks from Giacchino's orchestral score. The music featured influences of
John Williams
' score for earlier-
Steven Spielberg
directorials (Spielberg also served as the film's producer, through
Amblin Entertainment
) and was recorded in a short span of time. It received critical acclaim for the subtlety, minimalism, nostalgia factor and paying homage to Williams' with being considered as one of the film's best aspects. Giacchino won the
Saturn Award for Best Music
for his work in the film.
Background
[
edit
]
J. J. Abrams
enlisted
Mission: Impossible III
(2006) and
Star Trek
(2009) composer
Michael Giacchino
to score music for
Super 8
. Giacchino was simultaneously working on
Cars 2
(2011) and with the completion of the film's scoring on May 2011, he began working on the film thereafter, although he written 90% of the themes prepared for recording.
[1]
In an interview with
Collider
, Giacchino said that the score will have shades of early-
Steven Spielberg
directorials from the late-1970s and 1980s.
[1]
[2]
The score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage at
20th Century Fox Studios
, with Tim Simonec conducting the
Hollywood Studio Symphony
.
[3]
The album featured 33 tracks from Giacchino's score, and was released on June 13, 2011 by
Varèse Sarabande
record label.
[4]
Reception
[
edit
]
Jonathan Broxton wrote "this score is one of the most impressive cinematic works of Michael Giacchino’s career. While his TV score for Lost had the leitmotivic complexity to end all, and while his Oscar-winning score for Up had buckets of emotional pathos, and while scores like Star Trek had a great deal of action music power and resonance, Super 8 is the first of his scores to combine all three elements together into a satisfying whole that has worked personally for me as a standalone listening experience. This, combined with the obvious inspiration he took from the story and its deeper meanings, as well as the clear and intentional illusions to the classic work of John Williams, makes Super 8 a winner."
[5]
James Christopher Monger of
AllMusic
wrote "Spielberg and Williams' iconic themes may never find their match, but Abrams is wise to keep Giacchino as his right-hand man, as with each new collaboration, the pair inches closer and closer to greatness."
[6]
The Joy of Movies wrote "
Super 8
as a film had something special.  It felt genuine.  Capturing the feeling of that point between childhood and adolescence and the feelings that come with it.  This was a true adventure movie that wasn’t afraid to slow down and get to know its characters first and foremost like the classic films of the ‘80’s, and the music here is not afraid to do the exact same thing.  It is mysterious, it is reflective, and it manages what only the best scores do.  It provides the perfect emotional connection between us and the experiences of the characters.  This is one of the best scores of the year."
[7]
Filmtracks.com
wrote "A significant number of the cues from Giacchino's score could have been combined and shaved down to their highlights to create an outstanding 45 minute presentation. As it stands, none of the songs heard in the film is included and the score drags badly at several points. The product was delayed on CD until after audiences lost interest in the film at the theatres as well, leaving something of a sour note over the entire affair. Sound quality remains an issue with Giacchino's feature film scores, an incredibly flat and dull ambience making the music sound two rooms away and restraining the moments that should soar with vibrant energy. This issue is particularly pronounced in
Super 8
, with some of the fullest sequences perhaps unintentionally matching the archival sound of early 1980's scores. If Giacchino ever wants to actually match the engrossing tone of Williams' classics, perhaps he and his crew should shift the time they spend on conjuring cute, ridiculous cue titles to instead reworking the recording and mixing of these muted and very dry scores. Still, there are great moments on this album and it will make for a thorough souvenir for fans of the film, but like any score that features a secondary theme far more impressive than its primary one, you can't help but walk away from
Super 8
strangely disappointed."
[8]
James Southall of
MovieWave
wrote "
Super 8
is this composer’s finest work to date. The 78-minute album (which includes as a bonus the wonderful music Giacchino wrote for “The Case”, the film-within-a-film) doesn’t drag, is full of magical moments, has a handful of individual pieces of music of the highest order (not just the aforementioned “Letting Go” - which is worth mentioning again and again, to be honest, and worth listening to again and again - but several others - check out the fantastic, dynamic “The Evacuation of Lillian”) and while there are hints of Williams (most obviously the brilliant
Close Encounters of the Third Kind
), this is essentially pure Giacchino, and all the better for that. My only nit-pick is with the overly dry recording - otherwise this is an album to savour."
[9]
Analysis
[
edit
]
Writer Daniel Walber of
IndieWire
, analysed the subtlety of the film's music and the minimalistic nature it attributed to. He said the Giacchino had created the sweeping canvas on the lines of
John Williams
' music for
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
(1982) "filling the soundtrack with aching violins and sad piano that makes sure there’s absolutely no way you can miss out on the intended emotion of a scene" which was both "grating and obnoxious".
[2]
He cited several examples, including Giacchino's own score for
the film's opening sequence
in
Up
(2009), and said "With no dialogue, the music almost replaces verbal expression as we watch the early life and romance of our aging hero. The animation combines perfectly with the florid piano score, which is not only the sort of bravura composition that will stay with you long after the film has ended, but an extremely dynamic accomplishment as well. Giacchino uses melody to create a sort of musical story, which becomes an equal part of the visual narrative instead of simply supporting it."
[2]
Walber however felt that the film's score "has the kind of generic instrumentation and uninteresting structure that just seems uninspired in comparison".

Dame Imogen Cooper
,
DBE
(born 28 August 1949) is an English pianist.
Biography
[
edit
]
Cooper was born in North
London
, daughter of the musicologist
Martin du Pré Cooper
and artist Mary Stewart. She grew up surrounded by music through her parents and her older siblings: Felicity, Josephine and
Dominic Cooper
. Realising that Imogen had an exceptional musical talent her parents sent her at the age of 12 to
Paris
to study for six years at the
Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique
(CNSM) with
Jacques Février
,
Yvonne Lefébure
and
Germaine Mounier
. This was considered a provocative move by the music establishment, and there was a lengthy correspondence in The Times between Thomas Armstrong, Principal of the
Royal Academy of Music
in London, and Martin Cooper, arguing the pros and cons of taking a gifted child out of conventional education to specialise so early, and in a foreign country.
In 1967 at the age of 17, the CNSM awarded her a Premier Prix de Piano, a major distinction. Cooper was mentored in her late teens by
Arthur Rubinstein
and
Clifford Curzon
, and subsequently studied in Vienna with
Alfred Brendel
,
Paul Badura-Skoda
and
Jörg Demus
, particularly in her early twenties by Brendel, an experience that has resonated with her throughout her performing life. Apart from spending her teenage years in Paris, London has been Cooper's principal residence.
She is particularly known for her interpretations of
Schubert
and
Schumann
, but she has also been involved in modern music, giving the premières of works such as
Traced Overhead
by
Thomas Adès
.    As well as performing as soloist she participates in chamber music and  lieder, and has had a long-standing partnership with baritone
Wolfgang Holzmair
.
She was appointed
Commander of the Order of the British Empire
(CBE) in the
2007 New Year Honours
[1]
and
Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire
(DBE) in the
2021 Birthday Honours
for services to music.
[2]
She was awarded the
Queen's Medal for Music
in 2019.

*Club domestic league appearances and goals, correct as of 5 February 2023
Eial Strahman
(Born 21 June 1989 in
Córdoba
), is an
Argentine
-
Israeli
footballer
who plays for
Maccabi Herzliya
, as a
forward
.
Strahman was considered one of River Plate's best talents to come through the youth system and is nicknamed "The Monster" for his aggressive instincts. He is a left-footed striker and of
Jewish
heritage, having represented Argentina at the
2005 Maccabiah Games
.
Club career
[
edit
]
Strahman began through the youth ranks of
Talleres de Córdoba
, before moving to
Vélez Sársfield
, where he was the top scorer with 42 goals in 50 appearances for the youth team.
River Plate
[
edit
]
Following his successful season at Vélez for the youth team, he joined
River Plate
, with Velez entitled to 40 per cent of any future transfer fee to a European club.  Strahman made a strong start to his career at River Plate, scoring eight goals in his first five matches for the River Plate reserves.  He was also an unused substitute in several of River Plate's final matches of the
2008-09 season
.
[1]
Strahman acquired the nickname "twitter" from his teammates because he is an avid user of this social network. Also, is rumored that he received a suspension for offending a referee in a tweet during a reserve match. This also lead to the decision to delete his account, but the name still prevailed.
Maccabi Haifa
[
edit
]
Strahman signed with the Israeli champions just days after they had qualified for the
UEFA Champions League
with an aggregate win over Austrian team
Red Bull Salzburg
. His debut match for Haifa did not come though until 23 September 2009 in a
Toto Cup
match against
Hapoel Petah Tikva
.
[2]
Strahman failed to make an impact on the match though and was substituted out in the 55th minute.
[3]
With the opening of the January transfer window, Maccabi Haifa released Strahman to Argentine club, Instituto.
[4]
[5]
Return to Argentina
[
edit
]
On 6 February 2010, Eial Strahman made his debut for Instituto, coming on for
Javier Correa
in a league match against
Independiente Rivadavia
. A week later he got his first start against
C.A.I.
For the
2010-11 season
, Strahman joined
Argentinos Juniors
, the reigning champion of the
Argentine Primera División
.
[6]
Mexico
[
edit
]
On August 30, 2012, Strahman joined
Club Universidad de Guadalajara
in the Mexican
Ascenso MX
, the second-tier league on a one-year contract. After only starting two games in the
Apertura 2012
, he became key in the team's impressive unbeaten run in the first half of
Clausura 2013
, where he scored 7 goals in 8 games.
Spain
[
edit
]
On 30 June 2013, Strahman signed with
Córdoba CF
in
Segunda División
, the Spanish second-tier.
[7]
Return to Israel
[
edit
]
Strahman scored a goal for
Sektzia Ness Ziona
in a practice match in May 2020. Given the lack of other football being played, this goal made news in Argentina.
[8]
On 5 November 2020 loaned to the
Liga Alef
club
Hapoel Bik'at HaYarden
.
International career
[
edit
]
Strahman's international allegiance has not been decided yet, as he is eligible to play for both Argentina, his country of birth, and Israel.  Strahman's father, Julio, spent ten years living in Israel from 1975 to 1985, and said of his son's international aspirations, "I have brought up my children to see Israel as their future home."  Eial himself has said "I look forward to a future opportunity to play for Israel", but also remarked that "I think I am good enough to play for Argentina one day".
[9]
In May 2009, Strahman was called up to represent the
Israel national under-21 football team
in a European qualifier against Bulgaria, however his club refused to release him for the match, saying that he would be needed for the first team in June.

Jerry Wheelock
Born
(
1784-09-19
)
September 19, 1784
Uxbridge
,
Massachusetts
, US
Died
October 10, 1861
(1861-10-10)
(aged 77)
Uxbridge, Massachusetts, US
Occupation
Textile pioneer at Uxbridge
Known for
Early American Textile Pioneer
Spouse
Sukey Day
Children
Charles A Wheelock
Parent(s)
Simeon Wheelock and Deborah (Thayer) Wheelock
Jeremiah Wheelock
(September 19, 1782 - 10 October 1861) was an American early industrial pioneer in the
Blackstone Valley
of
Massachusetts
, a region that incubated the early American industrial revolution.
[1]
Family
[
edit
]
He was the youngest son of
Simeon
and Deborah Thayer Wheelock of
Uxbridge, MA
,
[1]
[2]
and was born September 19, 1784, at Uxbridge.
[3]
He was a sixth generation descendant of the first Wheelock settler,
Rev. Ralph Wheelock
. The Rev. Ralph Wheelock of
Dedham, MA
who had been a contemporary of
John Milton
at
Oxford University
and who was a
Puritan
minister
in the 1630s, had been the first to establish public education in America.
[2]
Jerry was the youngest of eight in the Wheelock family at Uxbridge and was born just after the end of the
Revolutionary War
.
His father Simeon, had been a
blacksmith
, the town clerk, and a Lieutenant at
Lexington and Concord
in the
Massachusetts Militia
which preceded the more organized
Continental Army
. His father Simeon was killed in war action around two years after Jerry's birth.  Simeon died in September 1786 at the age of 45 when his horse slipped on the ice while engaged in the suppression of
Shays' Rebellion
in
Springfield
.
[1]
His mother, who raised him primarily by herself,  became his principal teacher,
[2]
although Uxbridge had a basic school since 1732.
[4]
At an early age Jerry was "put out to learn a trade"
[2]
as a maker of tubs, and pails.
[2]
Ancestry
[
edit
]
Jerry Wheelock is a 3rd great grandson of
Ralph Wheelock
(1600-1683).
An industrial incubator and early work experiences
[
edit
]
There was plentiful "bog"
iron ore
in Uxbridge, and at least three local
forges
for metal working and a working
triphammer
established by Caleb Handy at
Ironstone, Massachusetts
.
[1]
In 1810/1811
Daniel Day
completed the first
woolen mill
at Uxbridge in 1809,
[5]
a town that one day would be headquarters and next in line to become America's largest woolen company.
[6]
Jerry married Sukey Day (1789-1875), the daughter of
Daniel
and Sylvia Wheelock (maiden; 1764-1842) January 24, 1811, in
Uxbridge
.
[3]
Jerry soon became a full partner with Daniel Day &vCo. in the
Carding
machine company first established near the junction of the West and
Blackstone Rivers
.
[7]
After a few years, Jerry worked for Artemus Dryden of
Holden, MA
, which manufactured
Carding
machines near
Worcester, MA
the
county seat
.
[2]
Carding
machine manufacture in
Worcester County
began with
Pliny Earle I
at
Leicester, MA
, (near Holden), as early as the 1780s.
Jerry then was employed with the newly formed Rivulet Manufacturing company, founded by Chandler Taft in
North Uxbridge
in 1814, and worked his way up to Superintendent.
[2]
He later struck out on his own and manufactured his own machinery at Uxbridge until 1833 (age 49).
[2]
He and one of his sons, Charles Augustus Wheelock (1812-1895), then entered into a manufacturing business known as Jerry Wheelock and Son. His grandson Silas Wheelock joined the business in the 1840s.
[2]
Historic Significance
[
edit
]
The
Blackstone Valley
would later be known as a historic corridor of national significance to America's earliest
industrialization
.
[8]
The woolen mill started by
Daniel Day
and Jerry Wheelock continues today, two centuries later, under the name of
Berroco Inc.
a
yarn
distribution company, with headquarters for many years in the Elmdale section of Uxbridge, where Daniel and Jerry started the first woolen mill.
[2]
More recently it has since moved to nearby
North Smithfield, Rhode Island
.
[9]
Death
[
edit
]
Jerry died at Uxbridge on October 10, 1861, at the age of 77.

Raju Nair
(born April 13, 1952) is an Indian newspaper cartoonist. He is one of the most prominent cartoonists in the Malayalam
newspaper
industry. Though his official name is Raju Peter, even his close associates do not know this or this name is seldom known. Most importantly, he is the director of first tele-film with animated cartoons to be telecasted in a channel.
Currently he is working as the senior cartoonist of
Deepika
, the oldest newspaper in
Malayalam
language. He has been in the field of
cartoon
and caricatures for a quite long time, well over three and a half decades.
Birth and childhood
[
edit
]

Perumbavoor
in
Ernakulam district
of
Kerala, India
. He later moved to

and had his Lower primary education at Munnar Government LPS and Upper Primary education at Little Flower High School, Nallathanni in Munnar.
Having completed his high school studies from Nirmala High School in
Muvattupuzha
, he joined
Nirmala College
from where he completed his Pre-Degree (an equivalent course to the current 10+2 system) and graduation in Commerce. While he was in the college and school, he had won a number of prizes for drawing and painting.
Major achievement
[
edit
]
Nair is the director of the first tele-film in
Malayalam
with animated cartoon pictures. It was he who directed the first tele-film with animated cartoons entitled
Cherapai Kadhakal
. It was telecasted on the state-owned channel
Doordarshan
.
Career
[
edit
]
Cartoonist Raju Nair with Dr. John A Lent. The image was taken on 13-07-1993 during Dr. Lent's visit to Kerala.
With a view of kindling his talents in drawing and painting, he decided to start his career as an artist. Thus in the year 1978, he began working as an artist at the age of 26. Though in the initial phases, he preferred to remain behind the curtain and so he decided to take the profession of artist as a freelancer.
A couple of years were sufficient for Cartoonist Raju Nair to gain fame and name. His talents in drawing, particularly in cartooning or caricaturing, were widely appreciated and he got handful of offers from many art-related firms and magazines.
Career at
Deepika
[
edit
]
He joined
Deepika
in 1980 and ever since he is a strong presence in the cartoon column of this newspaper. During his 35-year-long career at
Deepika
he was awarded many times by the local and state government and non-government organizations.
He has been regularly publishing cartoons under the title Cartoon Scope for 23 years in
Rashtra Deepika
, the evening newspaper by Rashtra Deepika Ltd. which is the same publishers of
Deepika
. Cartoon Scope is most probably one of the oldest and lengthiest cartoon as it has reached nearly 6000 episodes. His cartoon entitled Mavelinadu (the land of Maveli in English) is one of the most popular cartoons all over the state.
Earmarking the 125th anniversary of the
Deepika
, a special exhibition of Cartoons by Raju Nair was held at

By contrast,
software
is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "
hard
" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.
Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or
instruction
. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable
computing
system, although
other systems
exist with only hardware.
Von Neumann architecture
[

Main articles:
Von Neumann architecture
and
Stored-program computer
Von Neumann architecture scheme
The template for all modern computers is the
Von Neumann architecture
, detailed in a
1945 paper
by Hungarian mathematician
John von Neumann
. This describes a design architecture for an electronic
digital computer
with subdivisions of a
processing unit
consisting of an
arithmetic logic unit
and
processor registers
, a
control unit
containing an
instruction register
and
program counter
, a
memory
to store both data and
instructions
, external
mass storage
, and
input and output
mechanisms.
[3]
The meaning of the term has evolved to mean a
stored-program computer
in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common
bus
. This is referred to as the
Von Neumann bottleneck
and often limits the performance of the system.

Types of computer systems
[
edit
]
Personal computer
[
edit
]
Basic hardware components of a  personal computer, including a
monitor
, a
motherboard
, a
CPU
, a
RAM
, two
expansion cards
, a
power supply
, an
optical disc drive
, a
hard disk drive
, a
keyboard
and a
mouse
Inside a custom-built computer: power supply at the bottom has its own cooling fan
The
personal computer
is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price. Desktop personal computers have  a
monitor
, a
keyboard
, a
mouse
, and a
computer case
. The computer case holds the
motherboard
, fixed or removable disk drives for data storage, the power supply, and may contain other peripheral devices such as
modems
or network interfaces.  Some models of desktop computers integrated the monitor and keyboard into the same case as the processor and power supply. Separating the elements allows the user to arrange the components in a pleasing, comfortable array, at the cost of managing power and data cables between them.
Laptops
are designed for portability but operate similarly to desktop PCs.
[5]
They may use lower-power or reduced size components, with lower performance than a similarly priced desktop computer.
[6]
Laptops contain the keyboard, display, and processor in one case. The monitor in the folding upper cover of the case can be closed for transportation, to protect the screen and keyboard.  Instead of a mouse, laptops may have a
touchpad
or
pointing stick
.
Tablets
are portable computers that use a
touch screen
as the primary input device. Tablets generally weigh less and are smaller than laptops.
Some tablets include fold-out keyboards, or offer connections to separate external keyboards. Some models of laptop computers have a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as a touch-screen tablet. They are sometimes called "2-in-1 detachable laptops" or "tablet-laptop hybrids".
[7]
Case
[
edit
]
Main article:
Computer case
The computer case encloses most of the components of the system. It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large
tower cases
provide space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs include a video display built into the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called
case modding
.
Power supply
[
edit
]
Main article:
Power supply unit
A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the computer. Laptops can run on built-in rechargeable battery.
[8]
The PSU typically uses a
switched-mode power supply
(SMPS), with
power MOSFETs
(power
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
) used in the converters and regulator circuits of the SMPS.
[9]
Motherboard
[
edit
]
Computer motherboard
Main article:
Motherboard
The motherboard is the main component of a computer. It is a board with
integrated circuitry
that connects the other parts of the computer including the
CPU
, the
RAM
, the disk drives (
CD
,
DVD
,
hard disk
, or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the
expansion slots
. The
integrated circuit
(IC) chips in a computer typically contain billions of tiny
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
(MOSFETs).
[10]
Components directly attached to or to part of the motherboard include:
The
CPU
(central processing unit), which performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is referred to as the brain of the computer.  It takes program instructions from
random-access memory
(RAM), interprets and processes them and then sends back results so that the relevant components can carry out the instructions. The CPU is a
microprocessor
, which is
fabricated
on a
metal-oxide-semiconductor
(MOS)
integrated circuit
(IC) chip. It is usually
cooled
by a heatsink and fan, or water-cooling system. Many newer CPUs include an on-die
graphics processing unit
(GPU). The
clock speed
of the CPU governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1 GHz and 5 GHz. Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling.
The
chipset
, which includes the
north bridge
, mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory; as well as
south bridge
, which is connected to the north bridge, and supports auxiliary interfaces and buses; and, finally, a
Super I/O
chip, connected through the south bridge, which supports the slowest and most legacy components like
serial ports
,
hardware monitoring
and
fan control
.
Random-access memory
(RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. It is typically a type of
dynamic RAM
(DRAM), such as
synchronous DRAM
(SDRAM), where
MOS memory
chips store data on
memory cells
consisting of MOSFETs and
MOS capacitors
. RAM usually comes on
dual in-line memory modules
(DIMMs) in the sizes of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger.
Read-only memory
(ROM), which stores the
BIOS
that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as
Bootstrapping
, or "
booting
" or "booting up". The ROM is typically a
nonvolatile BIOS memory
chip, which stores data on
floating-gate MOSFET
memory cells.
The
BIOS
(Basic Input Output System) includes boot
firmware
and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
(UEFI) instead of BIOS.
Buses
that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.
The
CMOS
(complementary MOS)
battery
, which powers the
CMOS memory
for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a
watch battery
.
The
video card
(also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive
video games
or running
computer graphics
software. A video card contains a
graphics processing unit
(GPU) and
video memory
(typically a type of
SDRAM
), both fabricated on
MOS integrated circuit
(MOS IC) chips.
Power MOSFETs
make up the
voltage regulator module
(VRM), which controls how much
voltage
other hardware components receive.
[9]
Expansion cards
[
edit
]
Main article:
Expansion card
An
expansion card
in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard.
Storage devices
[
edit
]
Main article:
Computer data storage
A storage device is any computing hardware and
digital media
that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers. Dedicated storage devices include
RAIDs
and
tape libraries
.
Fixed media
[
edit
]
Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media.
Hard disk drives
(HDDs) are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but
solid-state drives
(SSDs) are faster and more power efficient, although currently more expensive than hard drives in terms of dollar per gigabyte,
[11]
so are often found in personal computers built post-2007.
[12]
SSDs use
flash memory
, which stores data on
MOS memory
chips consisting of
floating-gate MOSFET
memory cells
. Some systems may use a
disk array controller
for greater performance or reliability.
Removable media
[
edit
]
To transfer data between computers, an external
flash memory
device (such as a
memory card
or
USB flash drive
) or
optical disc
(such as a
CD-ROM
,
DVD-ROM
or
BD-ROM
) may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an
optical disk drive
(ODD), and virtually all have at least one
Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port. Additionally, USB sticks are typically pre-formatted with the
FAT32
file system, which is widely supported across
operating systems
.
Input and output peripherals
[
edit
]
Main article:
Peripheral
Input
and
output
devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.
Input device
[
edit
]
Input devices
allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a
mouse
and
keyboard
, but laptop systems typically use a
touchpad
instead of a mouse. Other input devices include
webcams
,
microphones
,
joysticks
, and
image scanners
.
Output device
[
edit
]
Output devices
are designed around the senses of human beings. For example,
monitors
display text that can be read,
speakers
produce sound that can be heard.
[13]
Such devices also could include
printers
or a
Braille embosser
.
Mainframe computer
[
edit
]
Main article:
Mainframe Computer
A
mainframe computer
is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer. They are designed to perform large numbers of calculations for governments and large enterprises.

IBM System z9
mainframe
Departmental computing
[
edit
]
Main article:
Minicomputer
In the 1960s and 1970s, more and more departments started to use cheaper and dedicated systems for specific purposes like
process control
and
laboratory automation
. A
minicomputer
, or colloquially
mini
, is a class of smaller
computers
that was developed in the mid-1960s
[14]
[15]
and sold for much less than
mainframe
[16]
and mid-size computers from
IBM
and its direct competitors.
Supercomputer
[
edit
]
Main article:
Supercomputer
A
supercomputer
is superficially similar to a mainframe but is instead intended for extremely demanding computational tasks. As of November 2021
, the fastest supercomputer on the
TOP500
supercomputer list is
Fugaku
, in Japan, with a
LINPACK benchmark
score of 415 PFLOPS, superseding the second fastest,
Summit
, in the United States, by around 294 PFLOPS.
The term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology. Rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time. In mid-2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1 quadrillion (10^15 or 1,000 trillion) floating-point operations per second.
Supercomputers are fast but extremely costly, so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Supercomputers typically run military and scientific applications. Although costly, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country.

Hardware upgrade
[
edit
]
When using computer hardware, an
upgrade
means adding new or additional hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the
hard drive
with a faster one or a
solid state drive
(SSD) to get a boost in performance. The user may also install more
Random Access Memory
(RAM) so the computer can store additional temporary data, or retrieve such data at a faster rate. The user may add a
USB 3.0
expansion card
to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the
Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU) for cleaner, more advanced graphics, or more
monitors
. Performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for aged computers to meet a new, or updated program's system requirements.
In large organizations, hardware upgrades are handled by
administrators
who are also in charge of keeping
networks
running smoothly. They replace network devices like
servers
,
routers
and
storage devices
based on new demands and capacities.

Recycling
[
edit
]
Main article:
Computer recycling
Because computer parts contain
hazardous
materials, there is a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts.
[18]
Computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as lead, mercury, nickel, and cadmium. According to the
EPA
these e-wastes have a harmful effect on the
environment
unless they are disposed of properly. Making hardware requires energy, and
recycling
parts will reduce air
pollution
, water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions.
[19]
Disposing unauthorized computer equipment is in fact illegal. Legislation makes it mandatory to
recycle
computers through the
government
approved facilities. Recycling a computer can be made easier by taking out certain reusable parts. For example, the
RAM
, DVD drive, the
graphics card
,
hard drive
or
SSD
, and other similar removable parts can be reused.
Many materials used in computer hardware can be recovered by recycling for use in future production. Reuse of
tin
,
silicon
,
iron
,
aluminium
, and a variety of
plastics
that are present in bulk in computers or other electronics can reduce the costs of constructing new systems. Components frequently contain
copper
,
gold
,
tantalum
,
[20]
[21]
silver
,
platinum
,
palladium
, and
lead
as well as other valuable materials suitable for reclamation.
[22]
[23]
Toxic computer components
[
edit
]
The
central processing unit
contains many toxic materials. It contains lead and chromium in the metal plates. Resistors, semi-conductors, infrared detectors, stabilizers, cables, and wires contain cadmium. The circuit boards in a computer contain mercury, and chromium.
[24]
When these types of materials, and chemicals are disposed improperly will become hazardous for the environment.
Environmental effects

According to the
United States Environmental Protection Agency
only around 15% of the
e-waste
actually is recycled. When e-waste byproducts leach into groundwater, are burned, or get mishandled during recycling, it causes harm. Health problems associated with such toxins include impaired mental development, cancer, and damage to the lungs, liver, and kidneys.
[25]
That is why even wires have to be recycled. Different companies have different techniques to recycle a wire. The most popular one is the grinder that separates the copper wires from the plastic/rubber casing. When the processes are done there are two different piles left; one containing the copper powder, and the other containing plastic/rubber pieces.
[26]
Computer monitors,
mice
, and
keyboards
all have a similar way of being recycled. For example, first, each of the parts are taken apart then all of the inner parts get separated and placed into its own bin.
[27]
Computer components contain many toxic substances, like
dioxins
,
polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs),
cadmium
,
chromium
,
radioactive isotopes
and
mercury
. Circuit boards contain considerable quantities of lead-tin solders that are more likely to leach into groundwater or create
air pollution
due to incineration. In US landfills, about 40% of the lead content levels are from e-waste.
[28]
The processing (e.g. incineration and acid treatments) required to reclaim these precious substances may release, generate, or synthesize toxic byproducts.
Recycling of computer hardware is considered environmentally friendly because it prevents hazardous waste, including
heavy metals
and carcinogens, from entering the atmosphere, landfill or waterways. While electronics consist a small fraction of total waste generated, they are far more dangerous. There is stringent legislation designed to enforce and encourage the sustainable disposal of appliances, the most notable being the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the
European Union
and the United States National Computer Recycling Act.
[29]
Efforts for minimizing computer hardware waste
[
edit
]
As computer hardware contain a wide number of metals inside, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) encourages the collection and recycling of computer hardware. "
E-cycling
", the recycling of computer hardware, refers to the donation, reuse, shredding and general collection of used electronics. Generically, the term refers to the process of collecting, brokering, disassembling, repairing and recycling the components or metals contained in used or discarded electronic equipment, otherwise known as
electronic waste
(e-waste). "E-cyclable" items include, but are not limited to: televisions, computers, microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, telephones and cellular phones, stereos, and VCRs and DVDs just about anything that has a cord, light or takes some kind of battery.
[30]
Some companies, such as
Dell
and
Apple
, will recycle computers of their make or any other make. Otherwise, a computer can be donated to
Computer Aid International
which is an organization that recycles and refurbishes old computers for hospitals, schools, universities, etc.

Member of
Shams
Musical artist
Nobovar Chanorov
(
Tajik
:
Нобовар Чаноров
,
Persian
:
ناباور چناراف
) (born 25 December 1970) is a
Pamirian
singer of the
Shams group
. The Shams and Nobovar Chanorov are known as
Beatles
of Northern Badakhshan.
Created in 1995, Shams is today one of the best groups of
Rock and Roll
in
Tajikistan
. This group of 7 musicians between 25 and 40 years, originating in
Pamir
, is the most known group since their first concert in
Almaty
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Nobovar
was born in
Komsomolobod
in the
Rasht valley
of Tajikistan. His parents are originally from Dehrushan village of
Rushan
District of
Gorno-Badakhshan
Autonomous Oblast, in the
Pamir mountain region
. Himself being a
Rushani
speaker (one of the many
Pamiri languages
), he sings mostly in
Tajiki
and Rushani. However, he sings individual songs in
Spanish
, English and
Russian
.
Nobovar
has spent his childhood and schooling years in the home village of his parents - Dehrushan. He started his singing from early years. As part of his family tradition, he started playing rubab (the traditional local musical instrument) and accordion and singing maddoh (traditional motives for prays of god) and pop-songs. His father, seeing his talent, gave him to the local musical school which he attended after his formal school at certain days of the week.
A month before the peace agreement of civil war was signed in Tajikistan, the group has returned to
Dushanbe
.
Career
[
edit
]
As most of his youth days were spent playing different musical instruments and singing different types of traditional and pop-songs, this took him to the doors of the Institute of Arts in Dushanbe,
Tajikistan
. However, he graduated as an actor of drama rather than singer or musician. Nevertheless, he has maintained his commitment to and love of singing.
Today,
Nobovar
is one of the elite musicians of Tajikistan and arguably the best singer of the Pamirs in his own right and style.
Band
[
edit
]
The band
"Shams"
of which Nobovar is the lead singer has celebrated their 10th anniversary in Kokhi Borbad in
Dushanbe
in early 2010.
"Shams"
is known through Nobovar though there are talented musicians in the band some of whom went for professional development trips abroad.
The musicians of the group change regularly and Shams of today is known especially thanks to its singer Nobovar Chanorov and his guitarist
Iqbol Zavqibekov
. Up to now the group has produced 4 albums.
"Shams Band"
is also known in
Afghanistan
, in
Uzbekistan
, in
Russia
and in
Europe

.
Early life and career
[
edit
]
Born Alan Tudor Blaikley
[5]
in
Hampstead Garden Suburb
, London,
[6]
Blaikley was educated at
University College School
(UCS),
Hampstead
, and
Wadham College, Oxford
, where he read
Classical Moderations
(
Latin
and
Greek
) and English, and was Reviews Editor of the university newspaper,
Cherwell
.
After coming down from university, he joined forces with two old UCS friends
Ken Howard
and
Paul Overy
with whom, between 1962 and 1963, he ran and edited four issues of a magazine,
Axle Quarterly
, publishing early work by
Melvyn Bragg
,
Ray Gosling
,
Alexis Lykiard
,
Gillian Freeman
and
Simon Raven
, among others. An offshoot of the
Quarterly
was a series of five booklets on controversial topics commissioned by Blaikley, Howard and Overy,
Axle Spokes
(Axle Publications 1963):
Peter Graham
The Abortive Renaissance
,
[7]
a critical examination of British New Wave cinema; John Gale
Sex - is it easy?,
[8]
the emergence of the permissive society; Gavin Millar

At the same time, as a freelance, Blaikley wrote and narrated several
BBC Radio
programmes, including
Writing for Children
, in which he interviewed
C. S. Lewis
,
J. R. R. Tolkien
and
Enid Blyton
. From 1963 to 1964 Blaikley was a trainee producer with
BBC TV
Talks Department and worked on the daily current affairs programme
Tonight
.
It had been earlier, during his years as a
choir-boy
at
St-Mary-at-Finchley
, that he began to realise that, while his voice was less than brilliant, he did possess a gift for inventing ear-catching melodies. This period as a chorister he regarded as his essential musical education.

History
[
edit
]
The University of Guelph traces its origins back to when the
Ontario government
bought 200 hectares (500 acres) of farmland from Frederick William Stone and opened the Ontario School of Agriculture on May 1, 1874, which was renamed the
Ontario Agricultural College
(OAC) in 1880.
[10]
The Experimental Farm has been part of the original project along with the museum of agriculture and horticulture.
[11]
Its first building was Moreton Lodge, located where Johnston Hall now stands, which included classrooms, residences, a library, and a dining room.  In 1874, the school started an apiculture department, teaching students about bees and beekeeping, in a dedicated building. In more recent years, the program has continued at the Honey Bee Research Centre located in the Arboretum, continuing research on honeybee health, providing apiculture and beekeeping courses and offering "many other educational experiences" including informative videos for beekeepers.
[12]
[13]
The Ontario Agricultural College and Experimental Farm, Guelph, Canada, 1889
The Macdonald Institute was established in 1903 to house women's
home economics
programs, nature studies, and some domestic art and science.
[10]
[14]
It was named after its financier,
Sir William Macdonald
, who worked to promote domestic sciences in rural Canada, and founded
Macdonald College
and
McGill University College
. The Ontario Veterinary College (OVC), founded in Mimico in 1862, was moved to Guelph in 1922.
[15]
Famous economist
John Kenneth Galbraith
was an undergraduate at the college (graduating in 1931). In 1919 the Ontario Agricultural College aimed at recruiting "farm boys" with a low cost, two-year program ($20.00 per year) and "the lowest possible rate" for room and board.
[16]
This is ad for "farm boys" from the Ontario Agricultural College in 1919 recruiting them by talking about the low cost tuition
The
Ontario Legislature
amalgamated the three colleges into the single body of the University of Guelph on May 8, 1964. The University of Guelph Act
[17]
also brought about the Board of Governors to oversee administrative operations and financial management, and the Senate to address academic concerns. The non-denominational graduate and undergraduate institution was, and remains known especially for the agricultural and veterinary programs that shaped it.
[14]
Wellington College was established shortly after the University of Guelph Act, and five years later, was split three ways into the College of Arts (COA), which exists in the present day, the College of Physical Science and the College of Social Science. The Macdonald Institute would also be renamed the College of Family and Consumer Studies during the split.
[10]
After this split, the University of Guelph started reorganizing into its present-day form, starting from the establishment of the College of Biological Sciences (CBS) in 1971. The College of Physical Science would be married to the OAC's School of Engineering in 1989, creating the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS). The College of Social Science and the College of Family and Consumer Studies were joined to create the College of Social and Applied Human Sciences (CSAHS) in 1998. Finally, the College of Management and Economics (CME) would be established from the segregation of offered business, management and economic degrees and courses in 2006.
[10]
The university is named after the city. Guelph comes from the Italian
Guelfo
and the Bavarian-Germanic
Welf
also known as Guelf. It is a reference to the reigning British monarch at the time Guelph was founded,
King George IV
, whose family was from the
House of Hanover
, a younger branch of the
House of Welf
was sometimes spelled as Gwelf.

The Johnston Clock Tower at the main campus
The main university campus spans 412 hectares (1,017 acres), including the 165-hectare (408-acre)
University of Guelph Arboretum
and a 12-hectare (30-acre) research park.
Earliest examples of the campus' architecture date back to the inception of the Ontario Agricultural College and include the President's house and Raithby House, which were constructed with local limestone. The campus also has a number of notable midcentury modernist buildings, mostly in the
Brutalist
style, which were constructed in the 1960s as part of the school's expansion plan. Complexes such as the MacKinnon arts building and the McLaughlin library, overseen by architect
Josep Lluis Sert
, serve as major meeting places. The campus is well-populated with trees which line the main walkways, many of which are paved with red clay brick. The campus includes an arboretum.
Campus safety is provided by the University of Guelph Campus Community Police, First Response Team and Fire Safety officers.

Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) campuses
[
edit
]
The
Ontario Agricultural College
had a network of campuses and research stations throughout Ontario which were operated by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs
.
[15]
At one time, courses were offered in English in Guelph, Kemptville and Ridgetown, and in French at Campus d'Alfred near Ottawa. From 1889 to 1961, this college published the OAC Review, a magazine published by and for students, with topics on everything from political and social events to photographs from around campus.
[23]
In 2014, the University of Guelph announced that academic programmes at the Alfred and Kemptville campuses would close after the existing students completed their studies.
[24]
In early 2017, the University of Guelph web site clearly indicated that this institution was no longer offering programs at either location.
[25]
[26]
The OAC does operate in Guelph and at the campus in Ridgetown, Ontario at the former Ridgetown College of Agricultural Technology, on over 180 hectares (450 acres). It does not offer degree programs in this location. Instead, the focus is on technology transfer, with two and three year diploma programs. Specialties are agriculture, veterinary technology, environmental management and horticulture. This location also offers one-year certificate programs in performance horse handling and veterinary office administration. There is also an apprenticeship program for Dairy Herdsperson (new for 2017).

Student government on campus is governed officially through the university's Student Organization Policy. This document, created in 2005, provides the basis for accrediting student groups on campus. The student groups listed as Primary Student Organizations under the policy are:
The Central Student Association (CSA)
The Graduate Students' Association (GSA)
The College of Arts Student Union (CA-SU)
The College of Biological Science Student Council (CBS-SC)
The Gordon S. Lang School of Business and Economics Students' Association (Lang-SA)
The College of Engineering & Phyiscal Science Student Council (CPES-SC)
The College of Social & Applied Human Sciences Student Alliance (CSAHS-SA)
The Student Federation of the
Ontario Agricultural College
(SF-OAC)
The Central Veterinary Students' Association (CVSA)
Interhall Council (IHC)
Each of the above PSOs accredit and thus are held accountable for many of the various clubs and student groups on campus. The CSA accredits the most student groups, with approximately 70 accredited today. Generally CSA-accredited groups are special interest groups like CHAT (a multi-lingual group), the Jewish Students' Organization (JSO), or the Muslim Students' Association (MSA), catering to those who wish to begin new interest-specific clubs on campus. The College Governments (CASU, CBSSC, LSA, CEPSSC, CSAHS-SA, SFOAC and the CVSA) accredit academically focused groups while IHC accredits 14 groups (includes the temporary residence Brock House for the 2011/2012 year) as hall councils, one for each residence hall on campus.
Across campus, members of the Residence Student Government, known as
Interhall Council
, contribute to the programming in each hall. This group of 62 elected members works with students within their halls and are also responsible for facilitating a hall council for hall members to attend. During the 2011/2012 year, a council was stricken at the West Residence Family Housing units and the temporary Brock House residence, bringing the total number of councils to 14. Interhall Council also acts as a liaison between students and Student Housing Services, University Administration, and other on-campus organizations.

The Gryphon's men's football team won its only national championship in 1984. In 2008 the Gryphon's men's lacrosse team won the Baggataway Cup at the Canadian national field lacrosse champions with a 14-9 win over McGill University at Ron Joyce Stadium in Hamilton. The Gryphons are particularly well known for their exploits in athletics, having won the men's and women's
cross-country
titles consecutively six (2006-present) and seven (2007-present) times respectively.
[66]
The Gryphons won the men's track & field title in 2010, and both the men's and women's titles in 2008. The field hockey team won the national title in 2011.
[67]
In 2020, the university track-and-field head coach David Scott-Thomas was given a lifetime ban by
Athletics Canada
for violating its code of conduct.
[68]
[69]
The Globe and Mail
reported that Scott-Thomas had an alleged sexual relationship with an underage student athlete dating back to 2002-2004 (of consenting age, but unlawful with a person in a position of trust or authority) and he was also accused by multiple students of having fostered a toxic sporting culture for many years.
[70]
[71]
The university faced heavy criticism over its handling of the scandal when the reporting revealed that the administration had been aware of the allegations since 2006, but did little to address them and continued to employ the coach.
[72]
[73]
It was reported that the university quietly ended its relationship with Scott-Thomas and assistant coach Guyson Kuruneri in December 2019 after
The Globe and Mail
presented the university with the allegations against both Scott-Thomas and the administration's handling of the 2006 and more recent complaints, and requested an interview with the school administrators.
[70]
[74]
More than 200 faculty and staff wrote a letter to the university president demanding transparency and an independent review. In the letter, they categorized the content of
The Globe and Mail
report as "evidence of the worst kind of abuse of power" and indicated that "high-level administrators at the time may have participated in willfully ignoring and minimizing this abuse."
[74]
[75]
In 2021, a group of alumni from the university track and field program wrote an open letter expressing concerns that "the systems that enabled the health and well-being of many athletes to be harmed by individuals in positions of power are still in place," and urging the university "to undertake an independent, comprehensive, and transparent investigation to determine how its existing policies failed to protect student-athletes from an abusive environment."

Campus traditions
[

Painting Old Jeremiah
[
edit
]
Old Jeremiah
is the name of an antique British naval gun that rests along Winegard Walk in Branion Plaza, at the heart of the University of Guelph campus. Rumoured to have seen battle during the
War of 1812
, Old Jeremiah was last fired in April 1913. After
World War I
, the gun's barrel was plugged and it was brought to campus by students as a sign of remembrance for those lost in battle. It is often referred to simply and affectionately as
The Cannon
. During the 1970s, Old Jeremiah was briefly relocated to Johnston Green and renamed the Big Johnston.
As a result of jovial rivalry between Engineering and Agricultural Science students ("Aggies"), the cannon has enjoyed plenty of movement around the Guelph campus in the past as a result of practical jokes between the two majors. Although it is nearly impossible to determine the cannon's previous locations, it is rumoured to have traveled all over campus, at one point even perching on top of MacNaughton (a prominent university building containing the bookstore), and at another even disappearing altogether and showing up a day later on the
University of Western Ontario
campus. Eventually, fed up with the movement of Old Jeremiah, university officials cemented the cannon in place where it sits today. However, as a final stab at humour, a group of students shifted the still-mobile direction of the cannon's face, and aimed it at the fourth floor of the University Center, home of the institution's senior administration. Old Jeremiah rests in this position today. Due it appearing at University of Western Ontario ("Western") this started a long rivalry between the 2 universities
Despite its movement, the cannon enjoyed relative tranquility until the 1950s when an aspiring entrepreneurial student came up with the idea of painting a message on the highly visible landmark. The act of "painting the cannon" has since become a campus tradition with students, residences, sports teams, clubs and others braving the early morning hours to paint messages on the cannon, most often about upcoming events but also including birthday announcements, wedding proposals and insults. The etiquette governing "painting the cannon" is unofficial but well understood: 1) do not begin painting the cannon until the sun has set, 2) be finished by the time the first students arrive for classes in the morning, and 3) avoid profanity or coarse language. It is a well-accepted practice to "guard" the cannon until sunrise so as to avoid another person or group painting over one's message.
[77]
In fall 2010, Master of Fine Arts student and art teacher Dawn Johnston began to strip Old Jeremiah of all the layers of paint it had accumulated since the 1950s as an art project. Calling it "[her] form of sculpture", Johnston completed the project over a week's time within a wooden enclosure to avoid the watchful eyes of passing students. Some students were upset about the removal, claiming Johnston was "taking away [their] history", although the project was done with the approval of university faculty. Upon completion, the enclosure was removed and the bare cannon was revealed; however, the tradition of painting Old Jeremiah has since resumed.

The Pep Rally
[
edit
]
During the University of Guelph's orientation program, which takes place each year at the beginning of Orientation Week, all new students within each residence are taught a dance-often referred to as the Hall Boogie-which is performed to a variety of mixed popular songs. Awards are presented to the Halls which demonstrate the best spirit, creativity, synchronisation and co-ordination. Many of the dances are very impressive, despite being practised in typically an hour or less.
A University of Guelph dance move, Winding Your Toy, is almost always incorporated into each boogie, usually to a bass-heavy dance track. A winding motion is made with the rear hand-as if winding a wind-up toy-while the knees are bent in rhythm. The origins of "winding the toy" are not well known, yet it retains notoriety among students and friends of students at the university.
A team of Aggies during tug-of-war at College Royal
The Rally is the kick-off to the remainder of orientation activities. The University of Guelph must apply for a special noise permit for the event as the activity can often be heard for miles.
In 2004, "Student Power" was introduced as a low-key alternative event to the Pep Rally for anyone who may not be as inclined to participate in the highly energetic and boisterous Pep Rally.
During the renovation the location the Pep Rally is held (The School's football field) in 2012, an event named "Rally for Change" was held in place; in which hundreds of University of Guelph students went out into the local community and did street performances to raise money for Cancer research. The Pep Rally was held on a later date. This event has since also become a tradition with plans for it to also be incorporated in the orientation program in 2013.
College Royal
[

An annual feature of the university is its open house, known as College Royal. For a weekend each March, every part of the campus and its programs is exhibited to the public, from the barns of the Agricultural College to the sugar bush in the arboretum. It is highly popular with visitors of all ages, especially families with children who take advantage of the March break (the usual Ontario school break) to have an outing.
The 2006 College Royal was visited by
Rick Mercer
, taping a segment for his show, the
Rick Mercer Report

Ancient Egypt
was a civilization of ancient
Northeast Africa
, concentrated along the lower reaches of the
Nile River
, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed
prehistoric Egypt
and coalesced around 3100
BC
(according to
conventional Egyptian chronology
)
[1]
with the political unification of
Upper and Lower Egypt
under
Menes
(often identified with
Narmer
).
[2]
The
history of ancient Egypt
occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the
Old Kingdom
of the
Early Bronze Age
, the
Middle Kingdom
of the
Middle Bronze Age
and the
New Kingdom
of the
Late Bronze Age
.
Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, ruling much of
Nubia
and a sizable portion of the
Levant
, after which it entered a period of slow decline. During the course of its history, Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the
Hyksos
, the
Nubians
, the
Assyrians
, the
Achaemenid Persians
, and the
Macedonians
under
Alexander the Great
. The Greek
Ptolemaic Kingdom
, formed in the aftermath of Alexander's death, ruled Egypt until 30
BC, when, under
Cleopatra
, it fell to the
Roman Empire
and became
a Roman province
.
[3]
The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the
Nile River valley for agriculture
. The predictable
flooding
and controlled
irrigation
of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and
social development
and culture. With resources to spare, the
administration
sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent
writing system
, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and
a military
intended to assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite
scribes
, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a
pharaoh
, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of
religious beliefs
.
[4]
The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the
quarrying
,
surveying
, and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental
pyramids
,
temples
, and
obelisks
; a system of
mathematics
, a practical and effective
system of medicine
, irrigation systems, and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats,
[5]
Egyptian faience
and glass technology, new forms of
literature
, and the
earliest known peace treaty
, made with the Hittites.
[6]
Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Its
art
and
architecture
were widely copied, and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have
inspired the imaginations
of travelers and writers for millennia. A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians has led to the
scientific investigation
of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.
[7]
History
Main articles:
History of ancient Egypt
and
Population history of Egypt
The
Nile
has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.
[8]
The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled
agricultural economy
and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.
[9]
Nomadic
modern human
hunter-gatherers
began living in the Nile valley through the end of the
Middle Pleistocene
some 120,000 years ago. By the late
Paleolithic
period, the arid climate of Northern Africa had become increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.
Predynastic period
Main article:
Predynastic Egypt
A typical
Naqada II
jar decorated with gazelles (Predynastic Period)
In Predynastic and
Early Dynastic
times, the
Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today
. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed
savanna
and traversed by herds of grazing
ungulates
. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs, and the Nile region supported large populations of
waterfowl
. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first
domesticated
.
[10]
By about
5500 BC
, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and
animal husbandry
, and identifiable by their
pottery
and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the
Badarian culture
, which probably originated in the
Western Desert
; it was known for its high-quality ceramics,
stone tools
, and its use of copper.
[11]
Early tomb painting from
Nekhen
,
c.
3500 BC
, Naqada, possibly Gerzeh, culture
The Badari was followed by the
Naqada culture
: the
Amratian
(Naqada I), the
Gerzeh
(Naqada II), and
Semainean
(Naqada III).
[12]
[
]
These brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic
Egyptians
imported
obsidian
from
Ethiopia
, used to shape blades and other objects from
flakes
.
[13]
In Naqada II times, early evidence exists of contact with the
Near East
, particularly
Canaan
and the
Byblos
coast.
[14]
Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley.
[15]
Establishing a power center at
Nekhen
(in Greek, Hierakonpolis), and later at
Abydos
,
Naqada III
leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the
Nile
.
[16]
They also traded with
Nubia
to the south, the oases of the
western desert
to the west, and the cultures of the
eastern Mediterranean
and
Near East
to the east, initiating a period of
Egypt-Mesopotamia relations
.
[17]
[
when?
]
The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality
decorative stone vases
,
cosmetic palettes
, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a
ceramic glaze
known as
faience
, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines.
[18]
During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of
hieroglyphs
for writing the ancient Egyptian language.
[19]
Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150-2686 BC)
Main article:
Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)
The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early
Sumerian
-
Akkadian
civilization of
Mesopotamia
and of ancient
Elam
. The third-century
BC Egyptian priest
Manetho
grouped the long line of kings from
Menes
to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named "Meni" (or Menes in Greek), who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of
Upper
and
Lower Egypt
.
[20]
The
Narmer Palette
depicts the unification of the Two Lands.
[21]
The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the king
Narmer
, who is depicted wearing
royal regalia
on the ceremonial
Narmer Palette,
in a symbolic act of unification.
[22]
In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000
BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at
Memphis
, from which he could control the
labor force
and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical
trade routes
to the
Levant
. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate
mastaba
tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.
[23]
The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labor, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.
[24]
Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BC)
Main article:
Old Kingdom of Egypt
Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the
Old Kingdom
, fueled by the increased
agricultural productivity
and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.
[25]
Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the
Giza pyramids
and
Great Sphinx
, were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the
vizier
, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve
crop yield
, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a
justice system
to maintain peace and order.
[26]
Khafre
enthroned
With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt, a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services. Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local
temples
, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.
[27]
As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called
nomarchs
began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king. This, coupled with
severe droughts
between 2200 and 2150
BC,
[28]
is believed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.
[29]
First Intermediate Period (2181-2055 BC)
Main article:
First Intermediate Period of Egypt
After Egypt's
central government
collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.
[30]
In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the
optimism
and originality of the period.
[31]
Free from their loyalties to the king, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and
political power
. By 2160
BC, rulers in
Herakleopolis
controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in
Thebes
, the
Intef family
, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055
BC the northern Theban forces under
Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II
finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the
Middle Kingdom
.
[32]
Middle Kingdom (2134-1690 BC)
Main article:
Middle Kingdom of Egypt
A figure wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and whose face appears to reflect the features of the reigning king, most probably
Amenemhat II
or
Senwosret II
. It functioned as a divine guardian for the
imiut
, and it is wearing a divine kilt, which suggests that the statuette was not merely a representation of the living ruler.
[33]
Amenemhat III, the last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom
The kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's stability and prosperity, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.
[34]
Mentuhotep II and his
Eleventh Dynasty
successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier
Amenemhat I
, upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the
Twelfth Dynasty
around 1985
BC, shifted the kingdom's capital to the city of
Itjtawy
, located in
Faiyum
.
[35]
From Itjtawy, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted
land reclamation
and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in
Nubia
that was rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the "
Walls of the Ruler
", to defend against foreign attack.
[36]
With the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.
[37]
Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style.

The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom,
Amenemhat III
, allowed
Semitic
-speaking
Canaanite
settlers from the
Near East
into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe
Nile floods
later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the
Hyksos
.
[39]
Second Intermediate Period (1674-1549 BC) and the Hyksos
Main article:
Second Intermediate Period of Egypt
Around 1785
BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened, a
Western Asian
people called the
Hyksos
, who had already settled in the Delta, seized control of Egypt and established their capital at
Avaris
, forcing the former central government to retreat to
Thebes
. The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.
[40]
The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings, thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the
composite bow
and the horse-drawn
chariot
.
[41]
After retreating south, the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos'
Nubian
allies, the
Kushites
, to the south. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555
BC.
[40]
The kings
Seqenenre Tao II
and
Kamose
were ultimately able to defeat the
Nubians
to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor,
Ahmose I
, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty and, in the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the kings, who sought to expand Egypt's borders and attempted to gain mastery of the
Near East
.
[42]
New Kingdom (1549-1069 BC)
Main article:
New Kingdom of Egypt
Pharaohs' tombs were provided with vast quantities of wealth, such as the
golden mask from the mummy of Tutankhamun
.
The New Kingdom
pharaohs
established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the
Mitanni
Empire,
Assyria
, and
Canaan
. Military campaigns waged under
Tuthmosis I
and his grandson
Tuthmosis III
extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Beginning with
Merneptah
the rulers of Egypt adopted the title of pharaoh.
Between their reigns,
Hatshepsut
, a queen who established herself as pharaoh, launched many building projects, including the restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos, and sent trading expeditions to
Punt
and the Sinai.
[43]
When Tuthmosis III died in 1425
BC, Egypt had an empire extending from
Niya
in north west
Syria
to the
Fourth Cataract
of the Nile in
Nubia
, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as
bronze
and
wood
.
[44]
The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god
Amun
, whose growing cult was based in
Karnak
. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built.
[45]
Around 1350
BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to
Akhenaten
, he touted the previously obscure
sun deity
Aten
as the
supreme deity
, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day
Amarna
).
[46]
He was devoted to his new
religion
and
artistic style
. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored. The subsequent pharaohs,
Tutankhamun
,
Ay
, and
Horemheb
, worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the
Amarna Period
.
[47]

Around 1279
BC,
Ramesses II
, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.
[a]
A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the
Hittites
in the
Battle of Kadesh
(in modern
Syria
) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded
peace treaty
, around 1258
BC.
[48]
Egypt's wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the
Libyan
Berbers
to the west, and the
Sea Peoples
, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the
Aegean Sea
.
[b]
Initially, the military was able to
repel
these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern
Canaan
, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and
civil unrest
. After regaining their power, the high priests at the
temple of Amun
in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.
[49]
Third Intermediate Period (1069-653 BC)
Main article:
Third Intermediate Period of Egypt
Following the death of
Ramesses XI
in 1078
BC,
Smendes
assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of
Tanis
. The south was effectively controlled by the
High Priests of Amun at Thebes
, who recognized Smendes in name only.
[50]
During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under
Shoshenq I
in 945
BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in
Leontopolis
, and
Kushites
threatened from the south.

During the 25th Dynasty, Pharaoh
Taharqa
created an empire nearly as large as the
New Kingdom
's. Twenty-fifth Dynasty pharaohs built, or restored, temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal.

pyramids (many in modern Sudan)
since the Middle Kingdom.

Egypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the
Assyrian
sphere of influence, and by 700
BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667
BC the Assyrians began the
Assyrian conquest of Egypt
. The reigns of both
Taharqa
and his successor,
Tanutamun
, were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories. Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and
sacked the temples of Thebes
.

Late Period (653-332 BC)
Main articles:
Late Period of ancient Egypt
and
History of Persian Egypt
The Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the
Twenty-Sixth Dynasty
. By 653
BC, the Saite king
Psamtik I
was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first
navy
.
Greek influence
expanded greatly as the
city-state
of
Naucratis
became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of
Sais
witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525
BC, the powerful Persians, led by
Cambyses II
, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh
Psamtik III
at the
Battle of Pelusium
. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a
satrap
. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century
BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.
[59]
Following its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with
Cyprus
and
Phoenicia
in the sixth satrapy of the
Achaemenid Persian Empire
. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the
Twenty-Seventh Dynasty
, ended in 402
BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties, the
Thirtieth
, proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of
Nectanebo II
. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the
Thirty-First Dynasty
, began in 343
BC, but shortly after, in 332
BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to
Alexander the Great
without a fight.
[60]
Ptolemaic period (332-30 BC)
Main article:

In 332
BC,
Alexander the Great
conquered Egypt with little resistance from the
Persians
and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the
Macedonian
Ptolemaic Kingdom
, was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new
capital city
of
Alexandria
. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a centre of learning and culture, that included the famous
Library of Alexandria
as part of the
Mouseion
.
[61]
The
Lighthouse of Alexandria
lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the
Ptolemies
made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.
[62]
Hellenistic culture
did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and
Egyptian gods
were
syncretized
into composite deities, such as
Serapis
, and
classical Greek
forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of
Ptolemy IV
.
[63]
In addition, as
Rome
relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the
Romans
took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.
[64]
Roman period (30 BC - AD 641)

Egypt became a province of the
Roman Empire
in 30
BC, following the defeat of
Mark Antony
and
Ptolemaic
Queen
Cleopatra VII
by
Octavian
(later
Emperor
Augustus) in the
Battle of Actium
. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the
Roman army
, under the control of a prefect appointed by the emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.
[65]
Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.
[66]
Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.
[67]
The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.
[67]
From the mid-first century AD,
Christianity
took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from the pagan
Egyptian
and
Greco-Roman
religions and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of
Diocletian
starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.
[68]
In 391, the Christian emperor
Theodosius
introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.
[69]
Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.
[70]
As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak
their language
, the ability to read
hieroglyphic writing
slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to
churches
or abandoned to the desert.
[71]
In the fourth century, as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt found itself in the
Eastern Empire
with its capital at
Constantinople
. In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the
Sasanian Persian
army in the
Sasanian conquest of Egypt
(618-628). It was then recaptured by the Byzantine emperor
Heraclius
(629-639), and was
finally captured
by
Muslim Rashidun army
in 639-641, ending Byzantine rule.
Government and economy
Administration and commerce
The pharaoh was usually depicted wearing symbols of royalty and power.
The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme
military commander
and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the
vizier
, who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the
archives
.
[72]
At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called
nomes
each governed by a
nomarch
, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they
places of worship
, but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdom's wealth in a system of
granaries
and treasuries administered by
overseers
, who redistributed grain and goods.
[73]
Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use
coinage
until the
Late period
,
[74]
they did use a type of money-barter system,
[75]
with standard sacks of grain and the
deben
, a weight of roughly 91 grams (3 oz) of copper or silver, forming a common denominator.
[76]
Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn
5
+
1
⁄
2
sacks (200 kg or 400 lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn
7
+
1
⁄
2
sacks (250 kg or 550 lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140
deben.
[76]
Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.
[76]
During the fifth century
BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of
precious metal
rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.
[77]
Social status
Painted limestone relief of a noble member of Ancient Egyptian society during the New Kingdom
Egyptian society was highly stratified, and
social status
was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or
noble family
that owned the land.
[78]
Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a
corvée
system.
[79]
Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, known as the "white kilt class" in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.
[80]
The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. It is unclear whether
slavery
as understood today existed in ancient Egypt; there is difference of opinions among authors.
[81]
Punishment in ancient Egypt
The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest
peasant
was entitled to petition the
vizier
and his court for redress.
[82]
Although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants, they were able to buy and sell their servitude, work their way to freedom or nobility, and were usually treated by
doctors
in the workplace.
[83]
Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices, legal rights, and opportunities for achievement. Women such as
Hatshepsut
and
Cleopatra VII
even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as
Divine Wives of Amun
. Despite these freedoms,
ancient Egyptian women
did not often take part in official roles in the administration, aside from the royal high priestesses, apparently served only secondary roles in the temples (not much data for many dynasties), and were not so likely to be as educated as men.
[82]
Legal system
The Seated Scribe
from
Saqqara
,
Fifth dynasty of Egypt
; scribes were elite and well educated. They assessed taxes, kept records, and were responsible for administration.
The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as
Ma'at
.
[72]
Although no
legal codes
from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.
[82]
Local councils of elders, known as
Kenbet
in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.
[72]
More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the
Great Kenbet
, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.
[84]
Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or
impaling
the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.
[72]
Beginning in the New Kingdom,
oracles
played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a "yes" or "no" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgement by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an
ostracon
.

A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich
fertile soil
resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits.
Land management
was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.
[86]
Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons:
Akhet
(flooding),
Peret
(planting), and
Shemu
(harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the
growing season
lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.
[87]
From March to May, farmers used
sickles
to harvest their crops, which were then
threshed
with a
flail
to separate the straw from the grain.
Winnowing
removed the
chaff
from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.
[88]
The ancient Egyptians cultivated
emmer
and
barley
, and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.
[89]
Flax
plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of
linen
and to make clothing.
Papyrus
growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.
[90]
Animals
Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food, a depiction of
Aaru
from
Dayr al-Madīnah
.
The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and
animals
was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.
[91]
Animals, both
domesticated
and
wild
, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians.
Cattle
were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular
censuses
, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs.
Poultry
, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.
[92]
The Nile provided a plentiful source of
fish
. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.
[93]
The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and
oxen
as
beasts of burden
, and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the
Hyksos
in the
Second Intermediate Period
. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that
elephants
were briefly used in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of
grazing
land.
[92]
Cats
, dogs, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as
Sub-Saharan African
lions
,
[94]
were reserved for royalty.
Herodotus
observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.
[91]
During the Late Period, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess
Bastet
and the ibis god
Thoth
, and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.
[95]
Natural resources
Further information:
Mining industry of Egypt
and
Stone quarries of ancient Egypt
Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These
natural resources
allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and
fashion jewelry
.
[96]
Embalmers
used salts from the
Wadi Natrun
for
mummification
, which also provided the
gypsum
needed to make plaster.
[97]
Ore-bearing
rock formations
were found in distant, inhospitable
wadis
in the
Eastern Desert
and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive
gold mines
in
Nubia
, and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The
Wadi Hammamat
was a notable source of granite,
greywacke
, and gold.
Flint
was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.
[98]
Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as
sulfur
as cosmetic substances.
[99]
The Egyptians worked deposits of the
lead ore
galena
at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from
malachite
ore mined in the Sinai.
[100]
Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in
alluvial deposits
, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were used in the Late Period.
[101]
High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the Eastern Desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as
porphyry
, greywacke,
alabaster
, and
carnelian
dotted the Eastern Desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of
emeralds
in Wadi Sikait and
amethyst
in
Wadi el-Hudi
.

Trade

Ancient Egyptian trade
Hatshepsut's trading expedition to the
Land of Punt
The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their
foreign neighbors
to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the
Predynastic Period
, they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.
[103]

By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian trade with
Byblos
yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with
Punt
provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.
[107]
Egypt relied on trade with
Anatolia
for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone
lapis lazuli
, which had to be imported from far-away
Afghanistan
. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included
Greece
and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of
olive oil
.

Historical development

'Egyptian language'
in
hieroglyphs
The
Egyptian language
is a northern
Afro-Asiatic
language closely related to the
Berber
and
Semitic languages
.
[109]
It has the longest known history of any language having been written from c. 3200
BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are
Old Egyptian
,
Middle Egyptian
(Classical Egyptian),
Late Egyptian
,
Demotic
and
Coptic
.
[110]
Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.
[111]
Ancient Egyptian was a
synthetic language
, but it became more
analytic
later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite
articles
, which replaced the older inflectional
suffixes
. There was a change from the older
verb-subject-object
word order
to

[112]
The Egyptian
hieroglyphic
,
hieratic
, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic
Coptic alphabet
. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the
Egyptian Orthodox Church
, and traces of it are found in modern
Egyptian Arabic
.
[113]
Sounds and grammar
Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include
pharyngeal
and
emphatic
consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless
fricatives
and voiced and voiceless
affricates
. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine.
[114]
The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a
triliteral
or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the
person
. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton
S-Ḏ-M
is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is
sḏm
, 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:
[115]
sḏm ḥmt
, 'the woman hears'.
Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call
nisbation
because of its similarity with Arabic.
[116]
The word order is
predicate-subject
in verbal and adjectival sentences, and
subject-predicate
in nominal and adverbial sentences.
[117]
The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.
[118]
Verbs and nouns are negated by the
particle
n
, but
nn
is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences.
Stress
falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).
[119]
Writing
The
Rosetta Stone
(c. 196 BC) enabled linguists to begin the process of
deciphering ancient Egyptian scripts
.
[120]
Colorful Hieroglyphs in the
Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut
.
Hieroglyphic writing
dates from c. 3000
BC, and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called
hieratic
, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing,
Demotic
, became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.
[121]
Around the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified
Greek alphabet
with the addition of some Demotic signs.
[122]
Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine
[123]
and Islamic periods in Egypt,
[124]
but only in the 1820s, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by
Thomas Young
and
Jean-François Champollion
, were hieroglyphs
substantially deciphered
.

Literature

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the
Per Ankh
institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.
[126]
Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the
Pyramid
and
Coffin Texts
, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300
BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in
Ramesside
administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of
Harkhuf
and
Weni
. The genre known as
Sebayt
("instructions") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the
Ipuwer papyrus
, a poem of lamentations describing
natural disasters
and social upheaval, is a famous example.
The
Story of Sinuhe
, written in
Middle Egyptian
, might be the classic of Egyptian literature.
[127]
Also written at this time was the
Westcar Papyrus
, a set of stories told to
Khufu
by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.
[128]
The
Instruction of Amenemope
is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.
[129]
Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the
vernacular language
was more often employed to write popular pieces like the
Story of Wenamun
and the
Instruction of Any
. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700
BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the
demotic
script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the
Greco-Roman
period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as
Ramesses II
.

Lower-class occupations
Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of
mudbrick
designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.
[131]
Ceramics
served as household wares for the storage, preparation, transport, and consumption of food, drink, and raw materials. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.
[132]
Egyptians celebrated feasts and festivals accompanied by music and dance.
The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from
animal fat
and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.
[133]
Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and
cosmetics
. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's
income
.
[134]
Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported
lutes
and
lyres
from Asia.
[135]
The

mehen
, which had a circular gaming board. "
Hounds and Jackals

[137]
Juggling and

were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at

.
[138]
The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed
hunting, fishing
, and boating as well.
The excavation of the workers' village of
Deir el-Medina
has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world, which spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organization, social interactions, and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail.

Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed, the
cuisine of modern Egypt
retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.

Architecture
Main article:
Ancient Egyptian architecture
The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the
Great Pyramids of Giza
and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large
stone structures
with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.
[141]
The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in
Malkata
and
Amarna
, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs.
[142]
Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building,
Djoser
's mortuary complex, include
post and lintel
supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.
The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples, such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the
pylon
, the open
courtyard
, and the enclosed
hypostyle
hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period.
[143]
The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the
mastaba
, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground
burial chamber
. The
step pyramid of Djoser
is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs.
[144]
The use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal
pyramids of Nubia
.

The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.
[146]
These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The
Narmer Palette
, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.
[147]
Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.
[148]
Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with
gum arabic
as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.
[149]
Pharaohs used
reliefs
to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of
funerary art
, such as
shabti
statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.
[150]
During the Middle Kingdom,
wooden or clay models
depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the
afterlife
, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.
[151]
Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period,
Minoan
-style frescoes were found in
Avaris
.
[152]
The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the
Amarna Period
, where figures were radically altered to conform to
Akhenaten
's revolutionary religious ideas.
[153]
This style, known as
Amarna art
, was quickly abandoned after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.

Religious beliefs
Main article:
Ancient Egyptian religion
The
Book of the Dead
was a guide to the deceased's journey in the afterlife.
Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the
divine right of kings
. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by
gods
who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this
pantheon
changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting
myths
and stories into a coherent system.
[155]
These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.
[156]
The gods
Osiris
,
Anubis
, and
Horus
in the Tomb of Horemheb (
KV57
) in the Valley of the Kings.
Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the king's behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.
[157]
After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of
oracles
to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.
[158]
The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or
aspects
. In addition to the body, each person had a
šwt
(shadow), a
ba
(personality or soul), a
ka
(life-force), and a
name
.
[159]
The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his
ka
and
ba
and become one of the "blessed dead", living on as an
akh
, or "effective one". For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a "
feather of truth
." If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.
[160]
If they were not deemed worthy, their heart was eaten by
Ammit
the Devourer and they were erased from the Universe.
Burial customs
Main article:
Ancient Egyptian funerary practices
Anubis
was the ancient Egyptian god associated with mummification and burial rituals; here, he attends to a mummy.
The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by
mummification
, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.
[150]
Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by
desiccation
. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the
internal organs
, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in
canopic jars
.
[161]
By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called
natron
. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted
cartonnage
mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.
[162]
Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased.
Funerary texts
were often included in the grave, and, beginning in the New Kingdom, so were
shabti
statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.
[163]
Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.
[164]

The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the
ancient Near East
. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of
Buhen
on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the
Levant
. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer
Kush
and parts of the Levant.
[165]

Typical military equipment included
bows and arrows
, spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching
animal skin
over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using
chariots
that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the
khopesh
was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.
[166]
The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as
Seqenenre Tao II
and his sons, did do so.
[167]
However, it has also been argued that "kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops."
[168]
Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.

Technology, medicine and mathematics
Technology
Main article:
Ancient Egyptian technology
Glassmaking was a highly developed art.
In technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional
empiricism
, as evidenced by the
Edwin Smith
and
Ebers papyri
(
c.
1600 BC
), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and
decimal system
.
Faience and glass
Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the temple at Kom Ombo.
Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as
faience
, which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of
silica
, small amounts of
lime
and
soda
, and a colorant, typically copper.
[170]
The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as
Egyptian blue
, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or
sintering
) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.
[171]
The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.
[172]
It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding
trace elements
to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.
[173]
Medicine
Main article:
Ancient Egyptian medicine
The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from
malaria
and debilitating
schistosomiasis
parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to
abscesses
(though
caries
were rare).
[174]
The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted
periodontal disease
.
[175]
Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.
[176]
Adult
life expectancy
was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.
[c]
Edwin Smith surgical papyrus
(
c.
16th century BC
), written in
hieratic
, describes anatomy and medical treatments.
Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, such as
Imhotep
, remained famous long after their deaths.
[177]
Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.
[178]
Training of physicians took place at the
Per Ankh
or "House of Life" institution, most notably those headquartered in
Per-Bastet
during the New Kingdom and at
Abydos
and
Saïs
in the Late period.
Medical papyri
show
empirical knowledge
of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.
[179]
Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,
[180]
while
opium
,
thyme
, and
belladona
were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess
Isis
. Moldy bread, honey, and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns.
[181]
Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve
asthma
symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set
broken bones
, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.
[182]
Maritime technology
Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a
ship hull
and had mastered advanced forms of
shipbuilding
as early as 3000
BC. The
Archaeological Institute of America
reports that the oldest
planked
ships
known are the
Abydos boats
.
[5]
A group of 14 discovered ships in
Abydos
were constructed of wooden planks "sewn" together. Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of
New York University
,
[183]
woven
straps
were found to have been used to lash the planks together,
[5]
and
reeds
or
grass
stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.
[5]
Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to
Pharaoh Khasekhemwy
, originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000
BC, and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating. The ship dating to 3000
BC was 75 feet (23 m) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh, perhaps one as early as
Hor-Aha
.
[183]
Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with
treenails
to fasten them together, using
pitch
for
caulking
the seams. The "
Khufu ship
", a 43.6-metre (143 ft) vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the
Great Pyramid of Giza
in the
Fourth Dynasty
around 2500
BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a
solar barque
. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with
mortise and tenon
joints.
[5]
Seagoing ship from Hateshepsut's Deir el-Bahari temple relief of a Punt Expedition
Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean, especially
Byblos
(on the coast of modern-day Lebanon), and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the
Land of Punt
. In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a "Byblos Ship", which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run; however, by the end of the Old Kingdom, the term had come to include large seagoing ships, whatever their destination.
[184]
In 1977, an ancient north-south canal was discovered extending from
Lake Timsah
to the Ballah Lakes.
[185]
It was dated to the
Middle Kingdom of Egypt
by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course.
[185]
[d]
In 2011, archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt excavating a dried-up lagoon known as
Mersa Gawasis
have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like
Hatshepsut
's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles.
[186]
In 2013, a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King
Cheops
on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of
Suez
).

Mathematics

The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic
Naqada
period, and show a fully developed
numeral system
.
[e]
The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain.
[189]
Texts such as the
Rhind Mathematical Papyrus
and the
Moscow Mathematical Papyrus
show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction,
multiplication
, and division—use fractions, calculate the areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles and compute the volumes of boxes, columns and pyramids. They understood basic concepts of
algebra
and
geometry
, and could solve simple sets of
simultaneous equations

was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.
[191]
Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write
fractions
as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction
two-fifths
into the sum of
one-third
+
one-fifteenth
. Standard tables of values facilitated this.
[192]
Some
common fractions
, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.
[193]
Ancient Egyptian mathematicians knew the
Pythagorean theorem
as an empirical formula. They were aware, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the
hypotenuse
when its sides were in a 3-4-5 ratio.
[194]
They were able to estimate the area of a
circle
by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:
Area ≈ [(
8
⁄
9
)
D
]
2
= (
256
⁄
81
)
r
2
≈ 3.16
r

,
a reasonable approximation of the formula
π
r

.
[195]
The
golden ratio
seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including the
pyramids
, but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.

Estimates of the size of the population range from 1-1.5 million in the 3rd millennium BC to possibly 2-3 million by the 1st millennium BC, before growing significantly towards the end of that millennium.

DNA
Further information:
DNA history of Egypt
According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft, conflicting DNA analysis on recent genetic samples such as the
Amarna
royal mummies has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins.
[198]
In 2012, two mummies of two
20th dynasty
individuals,
Ramesses III
and "Unknown Man E" believed to be Ramesses III's son
Pentawer
, were analyzed by Albert Zink, Yehia Z Gad and a team of researchers under
Zahi Hawass
. Genetic kinship analyses revealed identical haplotypes in both mummies; using the Whit Athey's haplogroup predictor, the Y chromosomal haplogroup
E1b1a
was predicted.
[199]
A 2017 study by Schuenemann et al. analysed the maternal DNA (
mtDNA
) of 90 mummies from Abusir el-Meleq.
[200]
Additionally, three of the mummies were also analyzed for
Y-DNA
. Two were assigned to
West Asian
J
and one to haplogroup
E1b1b1
both are carried by modern Egyptians and are common in North Africa and the Middle East. The samples are from the time periods: Late
New Kingdom
, Ptolemaic, and
Roman
, and the study used 135 modern Egyptian samples (100 from modern Egyptians and 35 from el-Hayez Western Desert Oasis). The researchers cautioned that the affinities of the examined ancient Egyptian specimens may not be representative of those of all ancient Egyptians since they were from a single archaeological site. The authors of this study state that the Abusir el-Meleq mummies closely resembled Near Eastern populations. The genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent within this range even as different powers—including Nubians, Greeks, and Romans—conquered the empire. A wide range of mtDNA haplogroups were found including clades of J, U, H, HV, M, R0, R2, K, T, L, I, N, X, W. Modern Egyptians shared this mtDNA haplogroup profile. The authors of the study noted that the mummies at Abusir el-Meleq had 6-15% maternal sub-Saharan component while the 135 modern Egyptian samples had a little more maternal sub-Saharan component, 14-21%, suggesting some degree of influx after the end of the empire. "Genetic continuity between ancient and modern Egyptians cannot be ruled out despite this more recent sub-Saharan African influx, while continuity with modern Ethiopians is not supported".
[201]
Gourdine, Anselin and Keita criticised the methodology of the Scheunemann et al study and argued that the Sub-Saharan "genetic affinities" may be attributed to "early settlers" and "the relevant Sub-Saharan genetic markers" do not correspond with the geography of known trade routes".
[202]
In 2022, Danielle Candelora noted several limitations with the 2017 Scheunemann et al. study such as its "untested sampling methods, small sample size and problematic comparative data" which she argued had been misused to legitimize racist conceptions of Ancient Egypt with "scientific evidence".
[203]
In 2023,
Christopher Ehret
criticised the conclusions of the 2017 study which proposed the ancient Egyptians had a Levantine background based on insufficient sampling and a biased interpretation of the genetic data. Ehret argued this was reminiscent of earlier scholarship and also conflicted with existing
archaeological
,
linguistic
and
biological anthropological
evidence which determined the founding locales of Ancient Egypt to be the descendants of longtime populations in
Northeastern Africa
such as Nubia and the northern Horn of Africa.
[204]
Ehret also criticised the study for asserting that there was "no sub-Saharan" component in the Egyptian population.
[205]
Because the 2017 study only sampled from a single site at Abusir el-Meleq, Scheunemann et al.(2022) carried out a follow-up study by collecting samples from six different excavation sites along the entire length of the Nile Valley, spanning 4000 years of Egyptian history. 81 samples were collected from 17 mummies and 14 skeletal remains, and 18 high quality mitochondrial genomes were reconstructed from 10 individuals. The authors argued that the analyzed mitochondrial genomes supported the results from the earlier study at Abusir el-Meleq.
[206]
In 2018, the 4000-year-old mummified head of
Djehutynakht
, a governor in the Middle Kingdom of the 11th or 12th dynasty, was analyzed for mitochondrial DNA. The sequence of the mummy most closely resembles a
U5a
lineage from sample JK2903, a much more recent 2000-year-old skeleton from the Abusir el-Meleq site in Egypt, although no direct matches to the Djehutynakht sequence have been reported.
[207]
Haplogroup U5 is found in modern Egyptians,
[208]
[209]
and is found in modern Egyptian
Berbers
from the Siwa Oasis in Egypt. A 2009 study by Coudray et al. recorded haplogroup U5 at 16.7% in the Siwa Oasis in Egypt
[210]
whereas
haplogroup U6
is more common in other Berber populations to the west of Egypt.
In 2018, the mummified remains of two high-status Egyptian relatives, Nakht-Ankh and Khnum-Nakht were analyzed DNA by a team of researchers from the University of Manchester. The Y-chromosome sequences were not complete, but the Y-chromosome
SNPs
indicated that they had different fathers, suggesting that they were half-brothers. The SNP identities were consistent with mtDNA haplogroup M1a1 with 88.05-91.27% degree of confidence, thus "confirming the African origins of the two individuals" according to the study authors, based on their maternal lineage.
[211]
A 2020 DNA study by Gad, Hawass et al., analysed mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups from Tutankhamun's family members of the 18th Dynasty, using comprehensive control procedures to ensure quality results. They found that the Y-chromosome haplogroup of the family was
R1b
, which is believed to have originated in the Western Asia/Near Eastern region, and dispersed from there to Europe and parts of Africa during the
Neolithic
.
[212]
[213]
Haplogroup R1b is carried by modern Egyptians.
[212]
Modern Egypt is also the only African country that is known to harbor all three R1 subtypes, including
R1b-M269
.
[214]
The mitochondrial haplogroup was K, which is most likely also part of a Near Eastern lineage. The profiles for Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results. Because the relationships of these two mummies with the KV55 mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study, the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the KV55 data.
[212]
[213]
Genetic analysis indicated the following haplogroups:
Tutankhamun
YDNA R1b / mtDNA K
Akhenaten
YDNA R1b / mtDNA K
Amenhotep III
YDNA R1b / mtDNA H2b
Yuya
G2a / mtDNA K
Tiye
mtDNA K
Thuya
mtDNA K
Both Y-DNA haplogroups R1b and G2a, as well as both mtDNA haplogroups H and K, are carried by modern Egyptians.
[212]
In a comment on Hawas et al. (2010
[215]
&2012
[216]
), Keita pointed out, based on inserting the data into the PopAffiliator online calculator, which only calculates affinity to East Asia, Eurasia, and sub-Saharan Africa, but not to North Africa or the Near East, for instance,
[217]
that the majority of the samples: "have an affinity with sub-Saharan Africans in one affinity analysis, which does not mean that they lacked other affiliations—an important point that typological thinking obscures. Also, different data and algorithms might give different results, which would illustrate the complexity of biological heritage and its interpretation."

[219]
The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. Egyptian civilization significantly influenced the
Kingdom of Kush
and
Meroë
with both adopting Egyptian religious and architectural norms (hundreds of pyramids (6-30 meters high) were built in Egypt/Sudan), as well as using Egyptian writing as the basis of the
Meroitic script
.
[220]
Meroitic is the oldest written language in Africa, other than Egyptian, and was used from the 2nd century BC until the early 5th century AD.
[221]
The cult of the goddess
Isis
, for example, became popular in the
Roman Empire
, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.
[222]
The Romans also imported
building materials
from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus,
Strabo
, and
Diodorus Siculus
studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.
[223]
During the
Middle Ages
and the
Renaissance
, Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later
Islam
, but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as
Dhul-Nun al-Misri
and
al-Maqrizi
.
[224]
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of
Egyptomania
across Europe, as evident in symbolism like the
Eye of Providence
and the
Great Seal of the United States
. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.
[225]
Napoleon
arranged the first studies in
Egyptology
when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's
natural history
, which was published in the
Description de l'Égypte
.
[226]
In the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. Since the 2010s, the
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities
has overseen excavations and the recovery of artifacts.

Edmond J. Safra
(
Arabic
:
ادموند يعقوب صفرا
; 6 August 1932 - 3 December 1999) was a Lebanese-Brazilian
[4]
[3]
banker and philanthropist who continued the family tradition of banking in Brazil and Switzerland. He was married to
Lily Watkins
from 1976 until his death. He died in a fire that attracted wide media interest, and was judicially determined to be due to arson.
Biography
[
edit
]
The
Safra family
came from
Beirut
, Lebanon,
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
and is of
Sephardic Jewish
background originally from
Lebanon
and
Aleppo
.  Edmond's  father,
Jacob Safra
, had opened the J. E. Safra Bank in 1920 in
Beirut
and in 1929 it became the Banque Jacob E. Safra which in 1956 changed its name to Banque de Credit National S.A.L. (BCN).
[9]
By the time he was sixteen, Edmond Safra was working at his father's bank in Beirut, engaged in the precious metals and foreign exchange aspects of the business.
In 1949, the family moved from Lebanon to Italy, where he worked for a trading company in
Milan
. When he was 16, he earned $40 million during arbitrage transactions between Italian and British gold sovereigns and used this money to obtain a financial house in Geneva which became his Trade Development Bank which used only ancient Arabic script for its bookkeeping.
[10]
The family moved again in 1952, this time to Brazil, where Edmond Safra and his father founded their first Brazilian financial institution in 1955. He never made Israel his residence.
[11]
Career in banking
[
edit
]
In 1956, Edmond Safra settled in Geneva to set up a private bank, the
Trade Development Bank
, which grew from an original US$1 million to US$5 billion during the 1980s. He extended his financial empire to satisfy his wealthy clients from around the world. He also founded the
Republic National Bank of New York
in 1966, and, later, Republic National Bank of New York (Suisse) in
Geneva
. The Republic Bank operated 80 branches in the New York area, making it the number three branch network in the metropolitan region behind
Citigroup
and
Chase Manhattan
.
Safra's banking interests served clients in Monaco, Luxembourg and Switzerland.
[12]
From 1980 until Safra's death, Walter Weiner was Safra's attorney and CEO of Republic National Bank of New York and, in 1983, Weiner became chairman of the bank.
[12]
The sale of
Trade Development Bank
to
American Express
for more than US$450 million in 1983, turned into a legal battle between the two parties. The financier came out on top, winning a public apology from American Express for starting a smear campaign against him
[13]
and US$8 million in damages, all of which he donated to charities.
[14]
[15]
In 1988, he also founded Safra Republic Holdings S.A., a Luxembourg bank holding company.
[16]
By the early 1990s, Safra's fortune was an estimated at US$2.5 billion. He was a major philanthropist during his lifetime, and he left his wealth to the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation
[17]
which supports hundreds of projects in fifty countries around the world in the areas of education, science and medicine, religion, culture and humanitarian assistance.
In 1996 Safra co-founded
Hermitage Capital Management
with
Beny Steinmetz
and
Bill Browder
.
[18]
The hedge fund became one of the most important investment companies in Russia and later became famous in connection with the
Sergei Magnitsky
affair.
On 17 August 1998, Safra's Republic National Bank of New York lost 45% of its net income due its large holding of Russian bonds after the
1998 Russian financial crisis
.
[12]
In 1998, Safra's bank alerted the FBI and the Swiss justice about a possible money laundering scheme involving
IMF
money, the
Republic National Bank of New York
and the Republic National Bank of New York (Suisse), some other unidentified outlets, and Russian officials of both the Russian Ministry of Finance and the
Russian Central Bank
.
[19]
[a]
[b]
The IMF funds, which Italian newspaper
la Repubblica
estimated at $21.4 billion,
[19]
[22]
[23]
[24]
are said to have caused the
Russian financial crisis of 1998
.
[19]
[25]
[26]
[c]
Later life and death
[
edit
]
As he approached his 60s, Safra divided his time between his homes in
Monaco
, Geneva, and New York City and the
Villa Leopolda
on the
French Riviera
. Weakened by
Parkinson's disease
, he required nursing care.
[15]
[30]
[31]
On 2 December 1999, Edmond and Lily Safra gained Monegasque citizenship.
[30]
In 1999, he sold his Safra Republic Holdings and Republic New York Corporation to HSBC for $10.3 billion in cash.
[32]
[33]
On 31 December 1999,
HSBC Private Bank
became the new name for Safra's former holdings.
[34]
In December 1999, Safra and nurse Vivian Torrente were suffocated by fumes in a fire deliberately lit at the billionaire's Monaco home,
[35]
[36]
[37]
where he apparently felt so safe that he did not have his bodyguards stay the night.
[38]
On the night of the fire, Daniel Serdet, the attorney general and chief prosecutor of Monaco, stated that Samuel Cohen, Safra's personal security chief, stated that no security guards were needed.
[30]
[39]
Safra's nurse
Ted Maher
was arrested
[40]
under suspicion of starting the fire in order to gain attention "through a daring rescue", and then losing control unintentionally.
[41]
He was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
[42]
Edmond Safra left 50% of his assets to several charities.
[43]
Philanthropic activities
[
edit
]
Safra supported educational, religious, medical, cultural, and humanitarian causes and organizations around the world. The Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation carries on this work in his memory.
[44]
Emergency relief
[
edit
]
In April 1992, the Syrian regime dropped the travel restrictions on Jews. Edmond Safra, whose family had old ties with the city of
Aleppo
, offered to transfer 4,500 Syrian Jews by plane and financed their settling in Brooklyn.
[45]
Supporting faith
[
edit
]
Committed to his Jewish faith, Safra believed that constructing and renovating synagogues was important in places where there was a potential for a Jewish community to flourish, and synagogues around the world bearing his father's name testify to this commitment. Many of these were built in the world's major Jewish centers, but he also helped to build synagogues in more remote communities such as Manila and
Kinshasa
.
500 years after the last synagogue was built in Madrid he constructed a new one. He also helped to renovate and enlarge synagogues in Amsterdam, Istanbul, Naples, Budapest,
Rhodes
, and Vienna. Safra saved the oldest synagogue in France, in
Clermont-Ferrand
, from destruction by buying it for the community, and he contributed to the expansion of the
Cannes
synagogue and Synagogue Beth El in Paris.
[46]
He also helped refurbish synagogues in many small French cities including
Évian
,
Annemasse
, and others. Among the synagogues is the
Edmond J. Safra Synagogue
in New York City.
In addition to supporting a number of synagogues in Israel, the tombs of
Rabbi Meir Baal Haness
and
Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai
(2nd century CE) were especially important to him, and he was a generous supporter of these pilgrimage sites. For many years on
Shavuot
eve, the anniversary of his father's death, he would pray at the tomb of Rabbi Meir until dawn.
Enhance healthcare and finance medical research
[
edit
]
During his lifetime, Safra donated millions of dollars to provide treatment for the sick. Hospitals across the globe - the Hôpital Cantonal de Genève, the
Hôpitaux de France
, and countless institutions in the United States, for example - benefited from his generosity. He was one of the founders of
Albert Einstein Hospital
in
São Paulo
, today one of South America's major medical centers. In
Israel
, he initiated the construction of the Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital at the
Tel Hashomer hospital complex
.
In the area of medical research, he was a significant supporter of the
Institut Pasteur
in Paris, the
Weizmann Institute
in Israel, the
Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research
and a number of different centers studying specific diseases in France, the United States, and elsewhere around the world. He created the Edmond and Lily Safra Chair in Breast Cancer Research at
Tulane University
.
[47]
In France, the Edmond J. Safra Foundation
[17]
financially supports
Clinatec
.
[48]
Education
[
edit
]
Safra believed higher education was essential for every young person in the modern world, even though he himself never attended university. He provided university scholarship funds for tens of thousands of needy students through the International Sephardic Education Foundation (ISEF), an institution he and his wife established in 1977 to support deserving Israeli students.
[49]
Safra also helped universities directly, often through the support of chairs and particular programs (such as Judaic Studies). For example, at
Harvard University
he endowed the Jacob E. Safra Professorship of Jewish History and Sephardic Civilization, and the
Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics
; and he gave significant funds for the Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professorship in Latin American Studies.
[50]
At the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, he created the Jacob E. Safra Professorship of International Banking and the Safra Business Research Center.
Safra was awarded Honorary Doctorates by the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem
and
Yeshiva University (New York)
(where he established the Jacob E. Safra Institute of Sephardic Studies) for his ongoing support of those institutions.
With respect to younger children's education, Safra was especially devoted to schools in the cities where he lived - for example, he founded Ecole Girsa,
[51]
Geneva's first and largest Jewish school. He took great pride in founding the
Beit Yaacov
school in
Bat Yam
. He was also one of the world's most significant benefactors of
yeshivot
(religious schools training young men to be rabbis, Jewish teachers, and judges), assisting numerous institutions worldwide.
[52]
Honors
[
edit
]
Recognized for his philanthropy, Safra received a few official honors

Byzantine Empire
[
edit
]
June 17
-
Battle of Antioch on the Meander
: Seljuk forces led by Sultan
Kaykhusraw I
are initially victorious with the Latin mercenary cavalry (some 800 men) bearing the brunt of the casualties due to their flanking charge; exhausted by the effort in their attack, the Latin army under Emperor
Theodore I Laskaris
is struck in the flank and rear by the Seljuk forces. However, the Seljuks stop the fight in order to plunder the Latin camp - which allows Theodore's forces to rally and counter-attack the now disorganized Turks. Meanwhile, Kaykhusraw seeks out Theodore and engages him in single combat, but he is unhorsed and beheaded. The Seljuks are routed and the former Byzantine emperor
Alexios III Angelos
, Theodore's father-in-law, is captured and imprisoned, ending his days in enforced monastic seclusion.
[1]
October 15
-
Battle of the Rhyndacus
: Latin emperor
Henry of Flanders
lands with an expeditionary force (some 3,000 men) at
Pegai
, and marches eastwards to the
Rhyndacus River
. The Byzantine army (much larger in force overall) under Theodore I prepare an ambush, but Henry assaults his positions along the river and defeats the Byzantine army in a day-long battle. Henry marches unopposed through the remaining Byzantine lands, reaching south as far as
Nymphaion
.
[2]
Mongol Empire
[
edit
]
Spring -
Genghis Khan
summons his Mongol chieftains, and prepares to wage war against the
Jurchen
-led
Jin dynasty
in northern
China
. He advances across the
Gobi Desert
with a massive army of 100,000 warriors with 300,000 horses, strung out in perhaps 10-20 groups of 5,000-10,000 men each, each with camel-drawn carts, and all linked by fast-moving messengers. Meanwhile, the Jin Government mobilizes an army of 800,000 men, most of which are untrained peasants with low morale, and some 150,000 highly-trained cavalry. This vast army, however, is spread across the
Great Wall
, and garrisoned separate fortresses.
[3]
Battle of Yehuling
: Genghis Khan bypasses the Great Wall with little opposition, and splits his forces into two armies. The main army (60,000 men) is led by himself, and the other army is taken by his son
Ögedei
to attack the city of
Datong
. Genghis heads for the strategic
Juyong Pass
("Young Badger's Mouth") - which leads down to the capital of
Zhongdu
(modern-day
Beijing
), but along the way he is halted at the pass of Yehuling where the bulk of the Jin army awaits him. Between March and October, the battle is fought in three stages, after Genghis has defeated the Jin forces, he begins raiding the countryside before he withdraws for the winter.

Europe
[

Spring -
Albigensian Crusade
: Crusader forces led by
Simon de Montfort
conquer
Toulouse
and besiege
Lavaur
in southern
France
. On
May 3
, the city is retaken; on orders of Montfort the senior knights are hanged and some 400
Cathars
are burned alive.
[5]
March 26
- King
Sancho I of Portugal
("the Populator") dies after a 25-year reign at
Coimbra
. He is succeeded by his son
Afonso II
("the Fat") as ruler of
Portugal
. During his reign, he designs the first set of Portuguese written laws.
Livonian Crusade
: Battles of
Viljandi
and
Turaida
- The Crusaders fail to conquer the
Viljandi
stronghold, but manage to baptize
Sakala
and
Ugandi
counties (Southern
Estonia
).
September - The 16-year-old
Frederick II
is elected
in absentia
as German king by rebellious nobleman (supported by
Pope Innocent III
) at the
Diet of Nuremberg
(
Germany
).
[6]
England
[
edit

Summer - King
John of England
("Lackland") campaigns in
Wales
against
Llywelyn the Great
, prince of
Gwynedd
. In July, after the
Welsh uprising
, John and Llywelyn reach an agreement and a peace treaty is signed.
June - Papal legate
Pandulf Verraccio
arrives in
Northampton
to serve John with his excommunication ordered by Innocent III. For John this is a serious blow to his ability to rule the country.
John sends a gift of
herrings
to nunneries in almost every
shire
, despite his status as an excommunicant.
The
Papal Interdict of 1208
laid by Innocent III remains in force after John refuses to accept the pope's appointee.

Computer science
is the study of
computation
,
information
, and
automation
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Computer science spans
theoretical disciplines
(such as
algorithms
,
theory of computation
, and
information theory
) to
applied disciplines
(including the design and implementation of
hardware
and
software
).
[4]
[5]
[6]
Though more often considered an
academic discipline
, computer science is closely related to
computer programming
.
[7]
Algorithms
and
data structures
are central to computer science.
[8]
The
theory of computation
concerns abstract
models of computation
and general classes of
problems
that can be solved using them. The fields of
cryptography
and
computer security
involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing
security vulnerabilities
.
Computer graphics
and
computational geometry
address the generation of images.
Programming language theory
considers different ways to describe computational processes, and
database
theory concerns the management of repositories of data.
Human-computer interaction
investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and
software engineering
focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as
operating systems
,
networks
and
embedded systems
investigate the principles and design behind
complex systems
.
Computer architecture
describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
Artificial intelligence
and
machine learning
aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation,
planning
and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence,
computer vision
aims to understand and process image and video data, while
natural language processing
aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.
The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.

Glossary of computer science

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
(1646-1716) developed
logic
in a
binary number
system and has been called the "founder of computer science".
[14]
Charles Babbage
is sometimes referred to as the "father of computing".
[15]
Ada Lovelace
published the first
algorithm
intended for processing on a computer.
[16]
The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern
digital computer
. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the
abacus
have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division.
Algorithms
for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.
[17]
Wilhelm Schickard
designed and constructed the first working
mechanical calculator
in 1623.
[18]
In 1673,
Gottfried Leibniz
demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the
Stepped Reckoner
.
[19]
Leibniz may be considered the first
computer scientist
and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. In 1820,
Thomas de Colmar
launched the
mechanical calculator
industry
[note 1]
when he invented his simplified
arithmometer
, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment.
Charles Babbage
started the design of the first
automatic mechanical calculator
, his
Difference Engine
, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first
programmable mechanical calculator
, his
Analytical Engine
.
[20]
He started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the
salient
features of the modern computer".
[21]
"A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the
Jacquard loom
"
[21]
making it infinitely programmable.
[note 2]
In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine,
Ada Lovelace
wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the
Bernoulli numbers
, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.
[22]
Around 1885,
Herman Hollerith
invented the
tabulator
, which used
punched cards
to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of
IBM
. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work,
Percy Ludgate
in 1909 published
[23]
the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1914, the Spanish engineer
Leonardo Torres Quevedo
published his
Essays on Automatics
,
[24]
and designed, inspired by Babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read-only program. The paper also introduced the idea of
floating-point arithmetic
.
[25]
[26]
In 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the
arithmometer
, Torres presented in Paris the
Electromechanical Arithmometer
, a prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine,
[27]
on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically.
[28]
In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream,
Howard Aiken
convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business
[29]
to develop his giant programmable calculator, the
ASCC/Harvard Mark I
, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".
[30]
During the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful
computing
machines such as the
Atanasoff-Berry computer
and
ENIAC
, the term
computer
came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.
[31]
As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study
computation
in general. In 1945,
IBM
founded the
Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory
at
Columbia University
in
New York City
. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science. The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, which today operates research facilities around the world.
[32]
Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and Columbia University was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946.
[33]
Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.
[7]
[34]
The world's first computer science degree program, the
Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science
, began at the
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
in 1953. The first computer science department in the United States was formed at
Purdue University
in 1962.
[35]
Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.

Etymology
See also:
Informatics § Etymology
Although first proposed in 1956,
[36]
the term "computer science" appears in a 1959 article in
Communications of the ACM
,
[37]
in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a
Graduate School in Computer Sciences
analogous to the creation of
Harvard Business School
in 1921.
[38]
Louis justifies the name by arguing that, like
management science
, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.
[37]
His efforts, and those of others such as
numerical analyst
George Forsythe
, were rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with Purdue in 1962.
[39]
Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves. Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.
[40]
Certain departments of major universities prefer the term
computing science
, to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist
Peter Naur
suggested the term
datalogy
,
[41]
to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is
data science
; this is now used for a
multi-disciplinary
field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.
In the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the
Communications of the ACM
—
turingineer
,
turologist
,
flow-charts-man
,
applied meta-mathematician
, and
applied
epistemologist
.
[42]
Three months later in the same journal,
comptologist
was suggested, followed next year by
hypologist
.
[43]
The term
computics
has also been suggested.
[44]
In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "informazione automatica" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g.
informatique
(French),
Informatik
(German),
informatica
(Italian, Dutch),
informática
(Spanish, Portuguese),
informatika
(
Slavic languages
and
Hungarian
) or
pliroforiki
(
πληροφορική
, which means informatics) in
Greek
. Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in the
School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
).
[45]
"In the U.S., however,
informatics
is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain."
[46]
A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—
Edsger Dijkstra
, states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."
[note 3]
The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of
computer engineering
, while the study of commercial
computer systems
and their deployment is often called information technology or
information systems
. However, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as
cognitive science
,
linguistics
,
mathematics
,
physics
,
biology
,
Earth science
,
statistics
,
philosophy
, and
logic
.
Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.
[7]
Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as
Kurt Gödel
,
Alan Turing
,
John von Neumann
,
Rózsa Péter
and
Alonzo Church
and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as
mathematical logic
,
category theory
,
domain theory
, and
algebra
.
[36]
The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by
disputes
over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.
[47]
David Parnas
, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.
[48]
The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with
computational science
. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.
Philosophy
Main article:
Philosophy of computer science
Epistemology of computer science
Despite the word "science" in its name, there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science,
[49]
mathematics,
[50]
or engineering.
[51]
Allen Newell
and
Herbert A. Simon
argued in 1975,
Computer science is an empirical discipline. We would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. Nonetheless, they are experiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.
[51]
It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the
correctness of programs
, but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science.
[51]
Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in
civil engineering
and airplanes in
aerospace engineering
.
[51]
They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.
[51]
Proponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs can be
deductively reasoned
through mathematical
formal methods
.
[51]
Computer scientists
Edsger W. Dijkstra
and
Tony Hoare
regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical
axiomatic systems
.
[51]
Paradigms of computer science
A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science.
Peter Wegner
argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.
[52]
Peter Denning
's working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.
[7]
Amnon H. Eden described them as the "rationalist paradigm" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs
deductive reasoning
), the "technocratic paradigm" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the "scientific paradigm" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of
natural sciences
,
[53]
identifiable in some branches of
artificial intelligence
).
[54]
Computer science focuses on methods involved in design, specification, programming, verification, implementation and testing of human-made computing systems.

Outline of computer science
As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.
[56]
[57]
CSAB
, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the
Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM), and the
IEEE Computer Society
(IEEE CS)
[58]
—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science:
theory of computation
,
algorithms and data structures
,
programming methodology and languages
, and
computer elements and architecture
. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and
symbolic computation
as being important areas of computer science.

Theoretical computer science
Main article:
Theoretical computer science
Theoretical Computer Science
is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from the practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.
Theory of computation
Main article:
Theory of computation
According to
Peter Denning
, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be automated?"
[3]
Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question,
computability theory
examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical
models of computation
. The second question is addressed by
computational complexity theory
, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.
The famous
P = NP?
problem, one of the
Millennium Prize Problems
,
[59]
is an open problem in the theory of computation.

Claude Shannon
to find fundamental limits on
signal processing
operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.
[60]
Coding theory is the study of the properties of
codes
(systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for
data compression
,
cryptography
,
error detection and correction
, and more recently also for
network coding
. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable

Programming language theory
and
Formal methods
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of
programming languages
and their individual
features
. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting
mathematics
, software engineering, and
linguistics
. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.
Formal methods are a particular kind of
mathematically
based technique for the
specification
, development and
verification
of software and
hardware
systems.
[62]
The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and
life-critical systems
, where safety or
security
is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of
theoretical computer science
fundamentals, in particular
logic
calculi,
formal languages
,
automata theory
, and
program semantics
, but also
type systems
and
algebraic data types
to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance.

Artificial intelligence
Main articles:
Artificial intelligence
and
Bio-inspired computing
Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in
cybernetics
and in the
Dartmouth Conference
(1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as
applied mathematics
,
symbolic logic
,
semiotics
,
electrical engineering
,
philosophy of mind
,
neurophysiology
, and
social intelligence
. AI is associated in the popular mind with
robotic development
, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of
software development
, which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was
Alan Turing
's question "Can computers think?", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the
Turing test
is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

Discoveries
The philosopher of computing
Bill Rapaport
noted three
Great Insights of Computer Science
:
[70]
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
's,
George Boole
's,
Alan Turing
's,
Claude Shannon
's, and
Samuel Morse
's insight: there are only
two objects
that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".
[note 4]
All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
See also:
Digital physics
Alan Turing
's insight: there are only
five actions
that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:
[71]
move left one location;
move right one location;
read symbol at current location;
print 0 at current location;
print 1 at current location.
See also:
Turing machine
Corrado Böhm
and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only
three ways of combining
these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".
[72]
Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
sequence
: first do this, then do that;
selection
: IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
repetition
: WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.
The three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of
goto
(which means it is more elementary than
structured programming
).

Structured program theorem
Programming paradigms
Main article:
Programming paradigm
Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:
Functional programming
, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.
[73]
Imperative programming
, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
[74]
In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
Object-oriented programming
, a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.
[75]
Service-oriented programming
, a programming paradigm that uses "services" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and
mission critical
software programs
Many languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.
[76]
Research
Further information:
List of computer science conferences
and
Category:Computer science journals
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of
conference papers
is greater than that of journal publications.
[77]
[78]
One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.
[79]
Education
Main article:
Computer science education
Computer Science
, known by its near synonyms,
Computing
,
Computer Studies
, has been taught in UK schools since the days of
batch processing
,
mark sensitive cards
and
paper tape
but usually to a select few students.
[80]
In 1981, the BBC produced a
micro-computer
and
classroom network
and Computer Studies became common for GCE
O level
students (11-16-year-old), and Computer Science to
A level
students. Its importance was recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the
National Curriculum
, for Key Stage 3 & 4. In September 2014 it became an entitlement for all pupils over the age of 4.
[81]
In the
US
, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum, provision was fractured.
[82]
According to a 2010 report by the
Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) and
Computer Science Teachers Association
(CSTA), only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.
[83]
According to a 2021 report, only 51% of high schools in the US offer computer science.
[84]
Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea have included computer science in their national secondary education curricula,
[85]
[86]
and several others are following.

His father's death left the family in severe financial distress and he was unable to take art lessons, although he displayed considerable talent for drawing. Initially he worked as a
tanner
, then as a carpenter.

This was followed by an apprenticeship to a
copper engraver
. In 1927, he found employment with the Sonnenfeld publishing company, where he learned
typography
. While there, he met and befriended
Alex Leon
, an Expressionist graphic artist who introduced him to the trends in modern art.
His first exhibition was at the Journalists' Club in his home town. Shortly after, he participated in creating the "
Association of Fine Arts
[
de
]
". In 1933, he participated in a major exhibition of young artists at a hotel called the
Weiszlovits Palace
[
ro
]
,
[1]
together with his friend Leon,
Imre Földes
,
Imre Ványai
[
de
]
and others. His first solo exhibition came in March 1936. Over the next few years, he advertised in Budapest as a draftsman and lithographer. In addition to his paintings, he designed the covers and title pages for several books.
In May 1944, he and his colleague,
Jenő Elefánt
[
de
]
were transported to Mauthausen Concentration Camp.
[2]
He was put to death there sometime between then and the camp's liberation by the United States Army a year later.
[3]
The exact number of works he created is unknown, but it is believed that the great majority of them were destroyed during the war.
In January 1992, a large retrospective of local Jewish painters was held at the
Muzeul Țării Crișurilor
[
ro
]
in Oradea (Nagyvárad). The exhibition was called "Light and Spirit" and included  Grünbaum's works together with those of Leon,
Ernő Tibor
and

Format
[
edit
]
In each episode in any give series, a number of well-known local performers would be picked (varying between 6 and 8 each season) and in each episode, one singer would be centrally focused as the remaining artists sing songs by that specific artist or other songs that are meaningful to that artist. The original artist reflects on the "adaptions" (NOT "covers") of his/her songs done by the other participants. The final episode is usually consecrated to duets and a revisit to favorite performances during the season.

Susanna
"
Sonja
"
Graf
[1]
(December 16, 1908 - March 6, 1965) was a German and American
chess
player. She was a
women's world championship
runner-up and a two-time U.S. women's champion. In 2016, she was inducted into the
World Chess Hall of Fame
.
[2]
Early years
[
edit
]
Born in
Munich
, Susanna Graf was the daughter of Josef Graf and Susanna Zimmermann, both
Volga Germans
from the
Samara
region, who had moved to Munich in September 1906.
[3]
Her father was originally a priest in
Russia
, but moved to Munich to pursue life as a painter. She later wrote that despite the suffering she endured at the hands of her father, she was grateful that he taught her the game of chess when she was still a child.
Chess became her means of escape, both mentally and physically, and she began spending all her time in Munich chess cafés. Her fame as a coffeehouse player grew and she was introduced to and became the
protégée
of the German master,
Siegbert Tarrasch
. By age twenty-three, she had beaten
Rudolf Spielmann
twice in simultaneous competition and turned chess professional. She began traveling throughout Europe, following the chess circuit both for the experience and to distance herself from what she considered the ominous
National Socialist
movement based, at the time, in Munich.
During the early decades of the 20th century, female chess players were a rarity and Sonja Graf basked in the popularity and attention her sudden fame brought her as much as she exploited the freedom and independence of her new itinerant lifestyle. In 1934, she played against the era's other woman champion,
Vera Menchik
, in an
unofficial match
in
Amsterdam
and, subsequently, in an official
1937 world championship match
in
Semmering
,
Austria
. She lost both matches (by the scores of 1-3 and 4½-11½),
[4]
but was invited, along with Menchik, to participate in what would normally have been an exclusive male tournament held that year in
Prague
. She did not win against any of the champions, and her best result was a draw with the
Estonian
master
Paul Keres
.
In Argentina and the United States
[
edit
]
In 1939, Sonja Graf traveled to
Buenos Aires
,
Argentina
to play in the
Women's World Chess Championship
, held concurrently with the
8th Chess Olympiad
. As a result of her outspoken defiance of
Hitler
's government, she was taken off the list of German participants and played under "Libre" ("free" in Spanish) flag.
[5]
In September, with the tournament still in progress, Germany invaded
Poland
, unleashing
World War II
and causing unprecedented confusion within the competition. Some teams withdrew, others refused to play teams from certain countries. Both Graf and Menchik played the entire tournament. Graf won 16 games and lost 3, finishing second. In her game against Menchik, Graf lost after achieving a winning position, something she always regretted ("against Menchik, when she was world champion, I had a won game, but I found the three stupidest moves you could think of and lost."—
New Yorker
, September 19, 1964). Following the outbreak of the war, Sonja Graf, along with many other participants of the Olympiad,
[6]
had decided to remain in the safety of Argentina.
[7]
She quickly learned the
local Spanish
language, assimilated herself in the culture and wrote the books,
Así juega una mujer
(
This Is How a Woman Plays
), which describes her experiences as a chess player, and
Yo Soy Susann
(
I Am Susann
), recounting the physical and psychological abuse she suffered during her childhood. She also met
merchant mariner
Vernon Stevenson, whom she married in 1947.
The newlyweds moved to
Southern California
, settling in
Hollywood
, and Graf started playing under the name
Sonja Graf-Stevenson
. She retired from chess to give birth and raise her son Alexander, but subsequently returned to co-win (with
Gisela Kahn Gresser
) the 1957
U.S. Women's Chess Championship
. She and her family moved to
New York City
's
Greenwich Village
, where she gave chess lessons at
Lisa Lane
's
Queen's Pawn Chess Emporium
. In 1964 she had her second win in the U.S. Women's Championship, but was already suffering from the liver ailment which would take her life the following year. Sonja Graf died in New York City
2
+
1
⁄
2
months after her 56th birthday.

Peter Hug
(born in 1955) is a
Swiss
historian. From 2004 to 2020 he was the Foreign Affairs Secretary of the left-wing

[1]
Contributions to Debate about Switzerland’s role during World War II
[
edit

In connection with the
proceedings initiated in 1995 regarding heirless Jewish assets at Swiss banks
, Hug was commissioned by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs to prepare a report. This report was intended to disclose what happened to the Swiss assets of (predominantly Jewish) citizens of
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Romania
and other 'Eastern States'.

Switzerland had offered assets belonging to citizens of these states in return for compensation of Swiss assets lost to mass nationalizations undertaken by their Communist governments. Switzerland had signed Treaties to pursue this aim with Poland in 1949,
[2]
Hungary in 1950 and Romania in 1951.

In the final report, Hug accused former Federal Councilor and Justice Minister
Kurt Furgler
, who was responsible for implementing these treaties of having advocated for “a bending of the law”. Furgler was accused of having suggested to his colleagues in the
Federal Council
that, despite the lack of a legal basis to do so,  all assets of depositors from states with whom treaties were conducted, with the exception of Poland and Hungary, were to be handed over to a general fund for the support of former World War II refugees or given directly to the
Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities
. This would have constituted a de facto
expropriation
, because once the funds were moved and commingled, any existing individual heirs would have had a low chance of retrieving them. In the cases of Poland and Hungary, Hug found that Switzerland did not hand over the list of names of account holders to the respective governments. The Swiss government cited
Swiss bank secrecy
laws as well as concerns about possible Communist persecution of any heirs to the accounts.
[5]
While accepting responsibility to compensate any heirs to the funds transferred to Poland, Hungary and any of the other then-Communist Eastern European  governments under the aforementioned treaties, as well as publicize names of account holders, the Federal Council rejected and criticized the specific allegation made against Furgler in a press release.
[6]
Hug was later hired by the Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland - World War II (often called the
Bergier Commission
) to conduct an investigation. This was published in 2002 under the title "Swiss armaments industry and war material trade during the National Socialist period: corporate strategies - market development - political surveillance".
[7]
Research on the relations between Switzerland and Apartheid South Africa
[
edit
]
As part of the Swiss government-funded national research program "Relationship Switzerland - South Africa", Hug dealt with the relationship between Switzerland and the South African apartheid government. He wrote a report on the military, armaments industry and nuclear relations between Switzerland and South Africa.
[8]
[9]
His findings received international press coverage.
[10]
[11]
Hug came to the conclusion that Swiss companies such as
Sulzer
supplied important components for South Africa's uranium enrichment, which provided the necessary fissile material for the six atomic bombs produced by South Africa. After the Federal Council ordered a partial blocking of access to relevant files in the Swiss Federal Archives in 2003, in view of the threat of class action lawsuits against Swiss banks by victims of apartheid, Hug gave Swiss newspapers critical interviews on this subject.
[12]
This blocking of files only restricted Hug's work to a limited extent, since he was also researching relevant files in both government and privately owned South African archives.
Criticism of Switzerland’s policy regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine
[
edit
]
Hug strongly criticized Swiss military neutrality regarding the
Ukraine War
in multiple interviews given in Switzerland. In one he was quoted saying that “Whoever in a typically ‘neutral’ manner, does not distinguish between the aggressor and the attacked declares moral bankruptcy”. He further stated that “In particular, the Swiss commodity trading center, which is benefiting massively from
Putin
's war and is helping to finance it, naturally sees no problem in remaining ‘neutral’ “.

Francis Henry Walters
(9 February 1860 - 1 June 1922) was an Australian
cricketer
. He played in one
Test match
in March 1885, and played
first-class cricket
from 1881 to 1896.
[1]
Life and career
[
edit
]
Beginning with
Victoria
in 1880-81, Walters had played six first-class matches, with a top score of 32, when he was selected for his only Test, the Fifth Test against England in
1884-85
. Batting in the middle order, he scored 7 and 5, and England won by an innings and thus won the series 3-2.
[2]
He reached 50 for the first time, and went on to score 122, for The Rest against the Australian XI in 1888-89, and it was probably this innings that led to his selection in the Australian team to tour
England in 1890
.
[3]
Walters was not successful in England, scoring 351 runs at an average of only 10.02.
[3]
He displayed his best form in the seasons after the tour, when other players were preferred for the Australian team. Opening the innings for Victoria against
New South Wales
in 1890-91, he scored 106 in a team total of 181.
[4]
He moved to Sydney in 1895 after purchasing the Criterion Hotel there, and played a few matches in 1895-96 for New South Wales. All four of his first-class
centuries
were scored at the
Sydney Cricket Ground
.
[3]
Writing after Walters' death, the Test player and journalist
Jack Worrall
said, "He was class enough for any company in the land as a batsman, though he was particularly slow in the field."
[5]
Walters married Clara Louisa Barber in Melbourne in January 1884.
[6]
He became a prosperous real estate investor in Sydney.
[7]
He died at sea off
Bombay
[note 1]
while he and his wife were returning to Australia after an extended holiday in England.

Moxibustion in Michael Bernhard Valentini's
Museum Museorum
(Frankfurt am Main, 1714)
First page of
Shimetarō Hara
: "Effects of Moxa on hemoglobin and RBC count".
Iji Shinbun
, no. 1219, 10 Sept. 1927. (Summary in
Esperanto
)
Moxibustion
(
Chinese
:
灸
;
pinyin
:
jiǔ
) is a
traditional Chinese medicine
therapy which consists of burning dried
mugwort
(
wikt:moxa
) on particular points on the body. It plays an important role in the traditional
medical
systems of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. Suppliers usually age the mugwort and grind it up to a fluff; practitioners burn the fluff or process it further into a
cigar
-shaped stick. They can use it indirectly, with
acupuncture
needles, or burn it on the patient's skin.
Moxibustion is promoted as a treatment for a wide variety of conditions, but its use is not backed by good evidence and it carries a risk of
adverse effects
.
[1]
Terminology
[
edit
]
The first Western remarks on moxibustion can be found in letters and reports written by Portuguese missionaries in 16th-century Japan. They called it
botão de fogo
(
lit.
'fire button'), a term originally used for round-headed Western
cautery
irons. Hermann Buschoff, who published the first Western book on this matter in 1674 (English edition 1676), used the Japanese pronunciation
mogusa
. As the
u
is not very strongly enunciated, he spelled it "Moxa". Later authors
blended
"Moxa" with the Latin word
combustio
("burning").
[2]
[3]
The name of the herb Artemisia (mugwort) species used to produce Moxa is called
ài
or
àicǎo
(
艾
,
艾草
) in Chinese
[4]

Theory and practice
[
edit
]
Practitioners use moxa to warm regions and
meridian points
[6]
with the intention of stimulating
circulation
through the points and inducing a smoother flow of
blood
and
qi
. Some believe it can treat conditions associated with the "cold" or "yang deficiencies" in Chinese Medicine.
[7]
It is claimed that moxibustion mitigates against cold and dampness in the body, and can be used to treat lymphedema following intrapelvic lymph node dissection,
[8]
and help turn
breech babies
.
[9]
Practitioners claim moxibustion to be especially effective in the treatment of chronic problems, "deficient conditions" (weakness), and
gerontology
.
Bian Que
(
fl.
circa
500 BCE), one of the most famous semi-legendary doctors of Chinese antiquity and the first specialist in moxibustion, discussed the benefits of moxa over acupuncture in his classic work
Bian Que Neijing
. He asserted that moxa could add new energy to the body and could treat both excess and deficient conditions.
Practitioners may use acupuncture needles made of various materials in combination with moxa, depending on the direction of
qi
flow they wish to stimulate.
There are several methods of moxibustion. Three of them are direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and indirect moxibustion. Direct scarring moxibustion places a small cone of moxa on the skin at an acupuncture point and burns it until the skin blisters, which then scars after it heals.
[10]
Direct non-scarring moxibustion removes the burning moxa before the skin burns enough to scar, unless the burning moxa is left on the skin too long.
[10]
Indirect moxibustion holds a cigar made of moxa near the acupuncture point to heat the skin, or holds it on an acupuncture needle inserted in the skin to heat the needle.
[10]
There is also stick-on moxa.
Chuanwu lingji lu
(the Record of Sovereign Teachings), by Zhang Youheng, was a treatise on acu-moxa completed in 1869 and featuring several colour illustrations of the points on the body where moxa could be applied to treat the complaint.
The cervix point was used to treat retained placenta and intrauterine death.
The Neiting point was used to remedy retrograde cold (jueni) in the limbs; aversion to noise; profuse breakout of pox; painful, inflamed throats; unremitting toothache; yawning and somnolence; lack of appetite for food and drink; tinnitus (lit. cricket chirp [chanming] in the ear); ague (nüeji), etc.
The Yanglingquan point was used pain and swelling in the feet and knees; wind-cold-damp blockage disease (bi); one-sided paralysis; heavy, aching feeling in the back, making it difficult to sit or stand; facial oedema (fuzhong); distention and feeling of fullness (zhangman) in the chest, etc.
The Taichong point was indicated for acute and chronic infantile convulsions (lit. wind fright, jingfeng); epilepsy (dianxian) and spasms; sore throat; distention and feeling of fullness (zhangman) in the chest and sides; cold-damp beri-beri (jiaoqi); difficulty in walking; hernia (shanqi); dim vision; backache, etc.
The zhong 'e point was targeted for corpse infection (shizhu) and inimical visitation (kewu), malign attack (zhong 'e) [forms of demonic possession], etc. Moxibustion takes place on the left for male patients and the right for female patients.
Scrofula was to be treated at the point where it occurred, with garlic-partition moxibustion (gesuan jiufa).
Uses and effectiveness
[
edit
]
Most research into moxibustion comes from China and is generally of low quality.
[1]
Claims are made for its effectiveness for a wide variety of conditions, with some practitioners promoting it as a
panacea
.
[1]
Pregnancy
[
edit
]
There is some evidence to suggest that moxibustion, when included along with other procedures that are usual to care for a person who is at risk of a breech birth, may decrease the chances that the baby presents in the breech position and may decrease the chances of a person requiring oxytocin to help labour start or progress.
[9]
This evidence in considered to be of the "moderate" level of certainty by a 2023 Cochrane Systematic Review, however, the safety profile was not clear in these studies as adverse effects were not well considered or properly reported.
[9]
In addition, the need or role of turning the baby by performing an
external cephalic version
to prevent a breech birth along with these treatments is not known.
[9]
There is no evidence that moxibustion, when combined with standard care practices, helps reduce the risk of a person requiring a
caesarean section
.
[9]
It is also not clear if there are any benefits for preventing early
membrane ruptures
or a protective effect on the
umbilical cord blood
pH
level.
[9]

Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain,
[11]
cancer
,
[12]
stroke
,
[13]
ulcerative colitis
,
[14]
constipation
,
[15]
and
hypertension
.
[16]
Systematic reviews have found that these studies are of low quality and positive findings could be due to
publication bias
.
[17]
Adverse effects
[
edit
]
Moxibustion carries a risk of
adverse effects
including burns and infection.
[1]
Some side effects that have been reported include nausea, throat irritation, and abdominal pain from contractions when used in pregnancy.
Parallel uses of mugwort
[
edit
]
Mugwort amongst other herbs was often bound into
smudge sticks
. The
Chumash people
from southern California have a similar ritual.
[18]
Europeans placed sprigs of mugwort under pillows to provoke dreams; and the herb had associations with the practice of
magic
in
Anglo-Saxon
times.

History
[
edit
]
The
Main Range
Railway, between Murphys Creek and Harlaxton on the outskirts of
Toowoomba
, was built in 1865-1867 by railway builders Peto, Brassey and Betts, for the colonial
Government of Queensland
.
[1]
The Main Range, part of Australia's
Great Dividing Range
, was a formidable geological barrier to trade following pastoral settlement on the
Darling Downs
in the 1840s. An adequate transport link between the sheep stations of the Darling Downs and the ports of
Brisbane
and
Ipswich
became increasingly important to enable the export of wool and the import of station supplies. A number of dray routes were used, with varying degrees of difficulty, to move goods and people across the Main Range during the 1840s. From 1847
Spicer's Gap
replaced
Cunningham's Gap
(1828) as the preferred route in the southern Downs region. On the northern end of the Downs,
Gorman's Gap
was used from 1840, followed by
Hodgson's Gap
in 1842.
[1]
In 1855 the
Toll Bar Road
was opened and the traffic that soon came to use this route facilitated the expansion of the settlement of "The Swamp", from 1857 officially known as Toowoomba. By the early 1860s Toowoomba was the principal settlement on the Darling Downs, supplanting nearby
Drayton
as the service centre for the surrounding district. In this period, the pastoralists of the Darling Downs wielded significant political and economic power in the young colony of Queensland. This influenced the decision to initiate Queensland's railway network from Ipswich, considered the port for the Darling Downs, rather than Brisbane.
[1]
Queensland's earliest endeavours toward constructing a railway were through the activities of the
Moreton Bay Tramway Company
. The company intended to construct a tramway with horses hauling vehicles on timber rails, surveying a route between Ipswich and Toowoomba in 1861. The company failed to raise sufficient capital for the project to succeed and by the end of 1862 was insolvent.
[1]
Thereafter, the Queensland Government took responsibility for building the colony's railways. The first Railway Bill, authorising the government to construct and borrow funds for this purpose was passed on 3 September 1863. In the lead up to the Bill, Irish civil engineer
Abraham Fitzgibbon
, estimating comparative construction costs of rail gauges between Ipswich and Toowoomba, recommended to the government the adoption of a light railway with a
3 ft 6 in narrow gauge
(1,067 millimetres (42.0 in)). The ascent of the Main Range was the principal engineering and expense obstacle for the railway to Toowoomba and a narrow gauge allowed for tighter rail curves on the Range incline. A lighter railway with extensive use of curved track meant cheaper construction costs, lessening capital outlay. After much debate, the Queensland government adopted Fitzgibbon's proposal. While contemporary examples of shorter narrow gauge railways existed in other parts of the world, none were of the length or scale proposed for Queensland. The railway between Ipswich and Toowoomba was the first use of a narrow gauge for a main line.
[1]
Shortly after the bill was passed, Fitzgibbon was contracted as chief engineer, responsible for surveying the line, providing specifications and construction supervision. On 23 December 1863 he was appointed as Queensland's first
Commissioner of Railways
, a post held until October 1864. Sir
Charles Fox
was appointed consulting engineer, responsible for selecting the various components such as trains, rails and bridges to facilitate the railway. Samuel Willcox was responsible for the workforce involved in constructing the line.
[1]
The construction of the line between Ipswich and Toowoomba was divided into five sections. Section 1 was from Ipswich to
Grandchester
and opened on 31 July 1865. Tenders were called for Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 on 24 August 1864 to extend the line from Grandchester to Toowoomba. Messrs Peto, Brassey and Betts, contractors with extensive worldwide experience in railway construction and builders of Section 1, were awarded the contract on 27 February 1865 for a sum of
£
515,000.
[1]
Section 5, the ascent of the Main Range from Murphy's Creek to Toowoomba was the most difficult section to engineer, involving steep gradients of 1 in 50, nine tunnels, 47 bridges, 126 curves, numerous cuttings, embankments, culverts and nearly 18 miles (29 km) of track work. Extensive use of 5 chains (330 ft; 100 m) radius rail was necessary to negotiate the ascent. Nearly two thirds of the line required cutting, approximately one quarter embankments and the remainder tunnelling and bridging, over a rise close to 1,200 feet (370 m). Section 5 was engineered in two separate stages, delineated by the current site of
Spring Bluff railway station
. The incline from this point towards Toowoomba provided the most engineering challenges within Section 5, with work including five tunnels and three major bridges.
[1]
The immense scale of the Main Range Railway demanded large numbers of skilled and unskilled workers to complete the project. The Queensland Government's immigration agent advertised in Great Britain and Germany for railway workers, offering free passage on the Black Ball shipping line to artisans such as excavators, bridge carpenters, masons and bricklayers. During April 1866 a total of 1009 workmen were employed along Section 5.
[1]
Peto, Brassey and Betts contracted work for specified lengths of line or engineering features to agents, who were responsible for ensuring contracts were adhered to and who in turn employed gangs of workers. Peto, Brassey and Betts also appointed an Engineer-In-Charge,
Robert Ballard
, to oversee construction on the Main Range. Prior to working on the Main Range, Ballard had gained experience in tunnel construction in
New South Wales
and his expertise in challenging engineering work, especially
tunnelling
, determined his appointment. Ballard's high standard of work on Section 5 (the Main Range Railway), in comparison with other sections of the Ipswich to Toowoomba line, was noted in reports soon after its completion and was considered the least expensive section of the Ipswich-Toowoomba railway to maintain. The high standard of his work on the Main Range Railway later earned him appointments as Superintending Engineer on Queensland's Great Northern Railway (later known as
Central Western railway
) in 1872 and as Chief Engineer for the Central and Northern railways (1882). He was granted
£
5,000 in the 1880s by the Queensland Government for his achievements in cost-effective railway construction.
[1]
With the large amount of cutting and tunnelling required, much of the labour force was engaged in heavy manual labour to remove earth. While explosives were used to blast through rock, the work relied on large teams of men excavating with pick and shovel, assisted by horse and bullock teams to move earth, which was then used to create
embankments
. Such work in difficult terrain carried with it a high degree of risk and a number of work-related injuries and deaths occurred along the line during construction.
[1]
Tunnels were constructed where the terrain was too difficult to create cuttings. Two were ready for brick lining on 1 November 1865, one on 1 January 1866 and another on 13 Feb 1866. By April 1866 three quarters of the tunnelling had been excavated and work had begun on lining the tunnels. Within the tunnels, curved and straight rail, or a combination of both were laid. In addition to its two portals, tunnel 8 was constructed with the aid of a side gallery to allow boring to proceed on four faces. The side gallery is the only example of a side gallery on a railway tunnel thought to exist in Australia.
[1]
The tunnels built for the Main Range Railway are among Australia's earliest. In Queensland the only tunnels predating those of the Main Range are the two (
Victoria Tunnel
and the Six Chain Tunnel), built through the
Little Liverpool Range
in Section 2 of the main line opening 1 June 1866 (and still in use). The first railway tunnels were built in
Victoria
on the double line between
Melbourne
and
Bendigo
, opening in 1862 (still in use). New South Wales' first tunnel, initially supervised by Ballard, was the
Redbank Range Tunnel
at
Picton
which opened in early 1867 (since closed).
[1]
A large quarry now known as Cliffdale was established roughly halfway up the Main Range during construction, to supply ballast for the line. In later years the quarry was furnished with its own siding (since removed) and loading area, with stone extracted from the site into the 1950s.
[1]
The navvies (construction workers) and contractors resided in a number of camps along the course of the railway. From the base of the range upwards, camps included Gibbon's, Fountain's, Holmes', Main Range, Ballard's and Cameron's, generally named after the person responsible for the section of line in a particular area. The camps operated as temporary townships and bases for specific engineering projects. Bricks were being manufactured at Ballard's camp by August 1865. Peto, Brassey and Betts supplied a prefabricated church at Ballard's and buildings were supplied for community use at other camps. Fountain's, Holmes' and Ballard's camps were the most substantial, with Ballard's working population reported at about 500 in mid-1865.
[1]
Stores such as butchers and bakers were established and fresh produce was sourced from Toowoomba and Ipswich. Numerous drinking houses, legal and otherwise, provided workers with alcohol, meals and entertainment. Although many workers were single men, around one third were accompanied by their families. The makeshift nature of the camps led to inadequate sanitation with
typhoid
and
diphtheria
causing the death of a number of infants and young children in 1866 and 1867. One murder at Holmes camp and a small number of accidental deaths at campsites also occurred. Some 22 deaths (mainly infants) were recorded at Main Range camp.
[1]
The construction of the Main Range Railway took just over two years to complete. It was one of the most important early public works undertaken in Queensland and a major government investment in infrastructure. The first train to cross the Range made its entry into Toowoomba on 12 April 1867;
[2]
the official opening of the line took place on 30 April 1867.
[1]
[3]
The railway soon became the dominant transport artery for the movement of goods and people between Toowoomba and Ipswich. From Toowoomba the
Western railway line
extended to
Dalby
in 1868 while the
Southern railway line
reached
Warwick
by 1871. Numerous visitors to the Darling Downs in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries marvelled at the engineering and scenic qualities of the Main Range Railway. Until road transportation began to dominate in the twentieth century, the railway was intrinsically associated with the development of pastoral, agricultural and mining industries, closer settlement and the growth of townships on the Darling Downs and south western Queensland.
[1]
The Main Range Railway was one of the most challenging sections of line for enginemen during the steam era on the
Queensland Railways
. Despite the advent of more powerful locomotives during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the combination of sharp curves, steep grades and tunnels created difficult conditions for crews. Railway workers needed to ensure adequate supplies of coal and water to negotiate the crossing and
banking engines
were employed between Murphy's Creek and Toowoomba to assist ascending trains. On curved sections of track
inner check rails
were laid to minimise the possibility of
derailment
after 1897. Sandboxes were placed along the line to assist wheel traction. Despite being a difficult stretch of railway to work, the Main Range line has been relatively free of major disasters. Of the fatal incidents that have occurred, the worst was the
Murphy's Creek collision
(1913) when six men were killed.
[1]
Since its opening in 1867 the Main Range line has sustained a high level of usage with various maintenance and upgrading works ensuring its continuity as a vital transport link. By 1868 excessive wear from steep grades and sharp curves was reported and some sections of iron rail were replaced with steel. From 1875 all curves sharper than 10 chains (660 ft; 200 m) radius were re-laid with steel. In 1879 a proposal by Chief Engineer
Henry Charles Stanley
to re-lay track on the Main Range, to enable the use of heavier engines and to reduce maintenance was approved, with the work completed by 1883.
[1]
In 1882 plans for a plate girder overbridge were drawn up for the Ruthven Street overbridge, at the range summit near Harlaxton. The plate girder replaced an earlier timber structure but the existing brick abutments were retained. Only a small number of railway bridges with brick abutments were ever built in Queensland. A report of the Main Range Railway line in March 1867 included a description of the brick abutments and stone facings of the overbridge on the road to
Highfields
. As other surviving examples post-date the construction of the Main Range Railway, the brick abutments are thought to be the oldest in Queensland.
[1]
Between 1899 and 1902 the track was strengthened to support 12 long tons (12 t) axle loads and realigned to eliminate curves below a five chain radius, while the inadequate original iron girder bridges on timber piers were replaced with embankments and culverts. During this period
Swansons Rail Bridge
was constructed close to the summit of the range; it is notable as the first concrete arched rail bridge constructed in Australia. From the latter half of the 1990s to 2006, eleven timber bridges were replaced with steel or concrete drains. Other than the Swanson and Harlaxton bridges, only two remain: King's Bridge (timber) and Murphy's Creek Bridge (steel and concrete).
[1]
Over time, different materials including brick, stone and concrete have been used to stabilise cuttings, embankments and entrances to tunnels. Many of the culvert portals were replaced and sides of shallow cuttings removed on the south side of the track when an access road running parallel to the line was built between 1993 and 1996. More recently timber sleepers have been progressively replaced by concrete sleepers.
[1]
Spring Bluff railway station, 1907
After the opening of the line, a number of stations and sidings were established along the route between Murphy's Creek and Toowoomba stations. Stations were located at
Murphy's Creek
(1867),
Holmes
, known as 87 Mile siding until 1912,
Ballard
, in use by 1876,
Rangeview
, a public station by 1949, and
Harlaxton
(1884). Sidings included Cliffdale (by 1912), 88 and 95 Mile (1916) and Calobra, Commonwealth and Magoon (1942). While most of the components of these places are gone,
Spring Bluff railway station
(known as Highfields until 1890) survives as an example of the small railway settlements that used to exist on the range. Situated approximately halfway up the Main Range, equipped with a natural spring for watering and a level section of track, Spring Bluff has always been the principal halt between Murphy's Creek and Toowoomba and the only station equipped with a resident station master. Spring Bluff was utilised locally by nearby settlers and the Highfields sawmill.
[1]
By 1879, Spring Bluff station included a 7000-gallon gravity-fed supply of water, passenger station and office, porter's cottage and station master's residence. The existing station and night officer's quarters are thought to date from the 1880s. The
crossing loop
was extended in 1911 and 1959, with its current configuration dating from 1968. By 1963 the complex also included a signal cabin, single men's quarters (now removed), fettler's quarters, and loading bank. The station building contains two electric staff machines that demonstrate the safe management of multiple trains using the main range. No train driver was able to proceed between stations up or down the range without the issue of a staff. In 1992, Spring Bluff Station was decommissioned and Centralised Traffic Control (CTC) was installed.
[1]
From the early 1900s the picturesque surrounds of Spring Bluff became a popular local destination for recreation and leisure, with an entertainment shed provided on a rise behind the station between 1907 and 1911. In addition to recreation and leisure, Spring Bluff was and remains well known for its floral displays and gardens. Early evidence of efforts to beautify the surrounds exist in the sole remaining London Plane tree (
Platanus acerifolia
), one of five planted in 1870. From the 1910s, Queensland Railways began promoting the beautification of stations and growing of vegetables by station staff, with competitions held for the best displays. During the 1930s and 1940s Station Master Ralph Kirsop, his wife Lillian and night officers undertook extensive improvements to the gardens, creating flower beds terraced with blue metal stone. Spring Bluff Station was awarded prizes numerous times for its floral displays and produce.
[1]
After a period of post-war neglect, resident railway workers from the 1960s were required to assist in the upkeep of the gardens. Since this time the gardens have continued to be cultivated, offering alternating floral displays in summer and spring. In the 1970s
Queensland Rail
began excursions from Toowoomba to Spring Bluff and these trips continue to operate during Toowoomba's
Carnival of Flowers
in September. During the last quarter of the twentieth century, Queensland Railways continued to improve visitor amenities at Spring Bluff. Work included extending the grassed area below the pavilion, addition of a
cricket pitch
, planting of native and exotic vegetation and lawn grasses, construction of bitumen pathways and installation of an ex-Guard's Van to serve refreshments. Since 1995 the Spring Bluff Railway Station Trust Management Committee, composed of representatives from local councils and Queensland Rail, has been responsible for the management of the site. Lion's Club members have also contributed to the upkeep of the grounds and gardens. The Spring Bluff railway complex remains a well-patronised tourist attraction.
[1]
In the 1860s, the ambitious construction of the Main Range Railway provided the colony of Queensland a critical transport link for the export of goods from its interior. This role currently continues, with most of the traffic on the Main Range Railway laden with coal for overseas markets.

Main Range Railway Overview
[
edit
]
From Murphy's Creek Station, the railway begins its winding ascent up the Main Range, reaching the summit at Harlaxton before descending gently to Toowoomba Station. The line follows the contours of spurs and ridges, with the railway typically set in along ascending hillsides and banks that sit to the north of the track. Responding to the terrain, numerous built features including tunnels, cuttings, culverts, bridges, embankments and stabilizing works occur along the extent of the railway. Constantly changing and frequently spectacular vistas of steep timbered hills, gullies and distant ranges extend south east to the coastal plain.
[1]
The heritage boundary begins from the western side of the Murphy's Creek railway crossing, continuing within the boundary of the railway corridor as it ascends the Range, terminating on the summit at the Ruthven Street overbridge at Harlaxton.
[1]
The following descriptions relate to features inspected on two site visits. Other features not inspected are likely to exist along the railway. All descriptions are arranged according to type and in order of occurrence as the line ascends from Murphy's Creek. Locations included refer to the distance from
Roma
Street Station, as used by Queensland Rail. The extent of the 1860s railway campsites has not been determined.
[1]
Tunnels
[
edit
]
Nine tunnels occur along the Main Range Railway, bore through hillsides of varying height. Each tunnel differs in length and all feature elliptical portals and interiors lined with stone and brick. Directly outside the portals are steep cuttings that include retaining features of regular and rubble coursed stone walls.
[1]
Tunnel 1 is located at 142.07 kilometres (88.28 mi). The tunnel is straight with a length close to 65 metres (213 ft). The
spandrels
of the tunnel portals are infilled with regular coursed quarry faced sandstone, crowned by a deck and projecting
cornice
. The segments forming the arch on the entry portal are of rendered stone. Set into the hill above the cornice is a section of stone retaining wall. The exit portal arch segments are of quarry-faced stone. Internally, the arched ceiling of the tunnel is lined with bricks, meeting with a lining of smooth-faced stone. A coarsely dressed stone wall extends to the base of the tunnel.
[1]
Tunnel 2 is located at 142.4 kilometres (88.5 mi). The tunnel is straight with a length close to 80 metres (260 ft). The spandrels of the tunnel portals are infilled with regular coursed quarry-faced sandstone, crowned by a deck and projecting cornice. Sandstone segments form the arched entrance and small rendered side walls face the entrance. Internally, the arched ceiling of the tunnel is lined with bricks, meeting with a wall lining of smooth-faced stone. A coarsely dressed stone wall extends to the base of the tunnel. Concrete retaining walls supported by steel posts are located outside both portal entrances.
[1]
Tunnel 3 is located at 144.5 kilometres (89.8 mi). The tunnel is curved with a length close to 62 metres (203 ft). The spandrels of the tunnel portals are infilled with regular coursed quarry-faced sandstone, crowned by a deck and projecting cornice. Sandstone segments form the arched entrance of the tunnel. Internally, the arched ceiling of the tunnel is lined with bricks, meeting with a lining of smooth-faced stone. Exposed sections of the ceiling reveal a second lining of brick. A coarsely dressed stone wall extends to the base of the tunnel. The entrances to Tunnel 3 are marked by steep rock cuttings with extensive pick-facing and sections of stone retaining wall.
[1]
Tunnel 4 is located at 147.25 kilometres (91.50 mi). The tunnel contains straight and curved line with a length close to 161 metres (528 ft). The spandrels of the tunnel portals are infilled with regular coursed quarry-faced sandstone crowned by a deck and projecting cornice. Sandstone segments form the arched entrance of the tunnel. Internally, the arched ceiling of the tunnel immediately inside the entrance is lined with smooth-faced stone. Brick lining may occur further inside the tunnel. From mid-height a coarsely dressed stone wall extends to the base of the tunnel.
[1]
Tunnel 5 is located at 151.05 kilometres (93.86 mi). The tunnel is curved with a length close to 92 metres (302 ft). The spandrels of the tunnel portals are infilled with regular coursed quarry-faced sandstone crowned by a deck and projecting cornice. Sandstone segments form the arched entrance of the tunnel. Internally, the arched ceiling of the tunnel is lined with bricks. From mid-height a coarsely dressed stone wall extends to the base of the tunnel.

Culverts
[
edit
]
Culverts and drains occur frequently along the Main Range Railway. At varying depths beneath the rail, they direct water from the north side of the track, passing under the length of the railway and parallel access road and drain to the south east. The culverts and drains vary greatly in size shape and composition. Materials for culverts and drains include cut stone, mortared rocks, brick, concrete and corrugated iron piping. The following descriptions are of entrances situated on the north side of the track.
[1]

Located below the Fettler's quarters is the entrance to a small drain, with stone walls and rough timber decking.
[1]
Cuttings
[
edit
]
A number of double sided cuttings course through rocky spurs along the Main Range Railway. Each of these cuttings is short in length, accommodating a curving section of rail. Stabilising features occur on the cutting faces.
[1]
A cutting is located approximately 100 metres (330 ft) after the 137 kilometres (85 mi) peg. The cutting curves to the left, is high and steeply sloping, with sides of roughly equal height. Sections of concrete rendering occur on the right side of the cutting.
[1]
A cutting is located less than 250 metres (820 ft) past the 138 kilometres (86 mi) peg. The cutting curves to the right, is high and steeply sloping. The right side of the cutting is higher than the left, with vegetation growing out of the face. Sections of concrete rendering occur on both faces of the cutting.
[1]
A cutting is located between the 147 kilometres (91 mi) peg and the entrance to Tunnel 4 (147.25 kilometres (91.50 mi)). The cutting curves to the right and is short and low, with sides of roughly equal height. The right hand side is more steeply sloped than the left. Curving parallel to the cutting, at the base of the left side is a low guard of steel piping. A railway signal is located at the exit of the cutting
[1]
A cutting is located between Tunnel 8 (152.8 kilometres (94.9 mi)) and Tunnel 9 (153.85 kilometres (95.60 mi)). The cutting is high and curves to the right, with vegetation growing out of both faces. The right side of the cutting is higher while the left face is slightly steeper. Two sections of vertical stone or concrete walling are set into the left side of the cutting, roughly 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) apart.
[1]
A cutting is located between Swanson's Bridge (154.675 kilometres (96.111 mi)) and Tunnel 9 (153.85 kilometres (95.60 mi)). The cutting curves to the right and has a higher right side with vegetation growing on both faces from mid-height. Both faces pitch steeply near the base, sloping unevenly toward the top of the cutting. Curving parallel to the cutting, at the base of left side is a low concrete border.
[1]
Retaining and Stabilizing features
[
edit
]
As the Main Range Railway ascends, numerous retaining and stabilising features occur on hillsides and banks to the right of the track. A wide range of materials and construction techniques are evident and features are set in at different heights.
[1]
Extending adjacent to the railway for approximately 50 metres (160 ft), terminating at QR cant sign 138.22 kilometres (85.89 mi) is a stone retaining wall. The wall is evenly course and with a quarry-face dressed stone. The wall is set in from the base on a steeply sloping hillside with a height close to four metres. Two small rectangular metal QR signs are attached along the wall and tufts of grass grow from mid-level upwards.
[1]
Between the 140 kilometres (87 mi) post and a culvert at 140.8 kilometres (87.5 mi), steep high sections of rock face along the railway incorporate a number of stabilising features. Situated next to a railway signal marked "HS 27", a drain has been cut out of the rock extending vertically from a concrete culvert upwards over the top of the rock face. Immediately to the right of the drain, close to the top of the rock face is a set in, oblong section of lightly coloured brickwork. Extending from the edge of the culvert, a sloped retaining wall begins with a short section of rubble coursed stone. The wall continues with a section of quarry-faced stonework of about two metres in height. Parts of this wall have been rendered in concrete, and a section is collapsed with exposed earth. From the termination of the stone wall, the rock face projects closer to the rail track. A low vertical retainer of brickwork less than a metre in height is set in to the rock from the base section, extending for approximately 25 metres (82 ft). Some distance on, set in to an eroded face of sandstone, are sections of brickwork. The bricks are of varying size and colour. The largest section of brickwork extends vertically and then horizontally in the "up" direction, and is surrounded by other smaller sections.
[1]
Between 143.17-143.39 kilometres (88.96-89.10 mi) is a section of stone retaining wall. The wall is rubble coursed, less than one metre high and is set into the base of a grassed, sloping bank approximately 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high. A small rectangular metal QR sign has been attached to a stone along the wall.
[1]
Between a large, tiered modern cutting of shotcrete (known as
Moggill
's Wall and not of cultural heritage significance) and the entrance to Tunnel 3 (144.5 kilometres (89.8 mi)), a steep, high and long rock face incorporates a number of features. The rock face runs parallel to a large section of check railed curving track. The face begins with a wall of pick-faced, cut and dressed stone extending approximately seven metres high and wide. As the face increases in height, large sections of concrete rendering surround numerous areas of pick-faced exposed rock. Set in among eroded sandstone at various heights are sections of cut and dressed and mortared stone work. Small tufts of vegetation are scattered along the face. Directly outside the entrance to Tunnel 3, a high cutting of steep rock has extensive pick facing and a section of stone walling along its base.
[1]
Between the 148-149 kilometres (92-93 mi) posts a number of stabilising features are set in to the base of low sections of bank opposite the railway. Running parallel to a section of check railed curving track is a stone retaining wall. The wall is rubble coursed, and is set into the base of a steep low bank. Much of the higher portion of the wall is rendered and there is evidence of collapse. The wall continues for approximately 15 metres (49 ft), adjoining a low squared section of rock face close to the base, marked by a painted 7 within a white square. After passing a high tiered face of lightly coloured and loosely packed rock, a small low bank running parallel to a short, straight section of rail between two curves incorporates a number of features. Parallel to where the rail straightens is a steeply sloping retaining wall of brick. The bricks range in colour from orange to brown and are labelled: Campbells Redbank. The brickwork adjoins a low vertical section of pick-faced rock that extends until the next curve. The face contains a small section of cut and dressed stone and brickwork set in underneath the rock face to the base. Above the bank set into the hillside a section of stone walling is largely obscured by vegetation.
[1]
A large, high steeply sloping rock face between the 152-153 kilometres (94-95 mi) posts is attached with sections of concrete. Most of the concrete occurs along the base, with steel rods inserted in some higher sections.
[1]
Between the 154-155 kilometres (96-96 mi) posts, set into a steeply sloping face are two sections of high retaining wall. The cut and dressed stone blocks are long and rectangular with a mixture of pick and quarry facing. A small section of rubble coursed stone work divides the two sections. Tufts of grass grow through the top half of the wall. The hillside shows evidence of subsidence above and adjacent to the walled section.
[1]
Between Swanson's Bridge (154.675 kilometres (96.111 mi)) and the Rangeview Station site (155 kilometres (96 mi)) is a section of stone retaining wall. The wall is located on a steeply sloping face and is high set, close to the treeline. Much of the wall is obscured by vegetation.
[1]
Between the 157-158 kilometres (98-98 mi) posts, close to the summit of the range and running parallel to a section of check-railed curving track is a retaining wall. The wall is set into the base of a steep rocky hillside and is of cut and dressed stone with quarry-faced stone. The wall extends for approximately twenty metres.
[1]
Bridges
[
edit
]
A small number of bridges exist on the Main Range Railway, each differing in length, height and materials.
[1]
Located at 132.34 kilometres (82.23 mi) is a large concrete bridge that crosses Murphy's Creek. The bridge is supported by high concrete piers that widen towards their base. On top of the piers a steel girder
spans
the bridge. The bridge has an open deck, with the railway set into timber sleepers. A timber walkway with guardrail runs parallel to the bridge on its left hand side.
[1]
Located at 135.5 kilometres (84.2 mi) is King's Bridge, a medium length timber bridge, positioned over an underpass for Kherim Road, which is unsealed. The bridge is supported by six sets of three rounded pile piers, with diagonal braces bolted on each side. Each pier is capped with a single beam, upon which sit the timber girders that span the bridge. The bridge has an open deck, with the railway set into timber sleepers. A metal walkway runs parallel to the bridge on its south side. Concrete retaining walls supported by steel posts, are placed underneath both ends of the bridge.
[1]
Located at 154.960 kilometres (96.288 mi), over an unnamed gully near the top of the Toowoomba Range, is
Swansons Rail Bridge
. It is an unreinforced concrete arch construction, 99 feet (30 m) in length, built on a steep slope. It is curved in plan and consists of three 10.1 metres (33 ft) circular concrete arches, two concrete piers and two abutments. It carries a single 1.07 metres (3 ft 6 in) gauge railway and is built to a 12-ton axle load. The structure is detailed with prominent cornices at the bases of the arches and incised lines on the spandrel walls of a form similar to the joints that would occur in a stone bridge. The bridge is in a remote location accessible only by rail staff. It commands a vast view over the Toowoomba Range.
[1]
Located at 157.76 kilometres (98.03 mi), marking the end of the Main Range ascent is the Ruthven Street overbridge (Picnic Bridge). The bridge sits high above the railway, situated close to the site of the former Harlaxton Station and carries northbound traffic on Ruthven Street. The bridge is a riveted plate girder bridge, decked in concrete and supported on brick abutments with stone
quoins
. The features of the bridge are largely obscured by a pipework pedestrian bridge on its east face and a duplicate concrete bridge on its west face. These are later bridges and are not considered of cultural heritage significance.
[1]
Cliffdale Quarry
[
edit
]
Located between Tunnel 3 (144.5 kilometres (89.8 mi)) and Spring Bluff Station (146.17 kilometres (90.83 mi)) is Cliffdale Quarry. Set in some distance on the north side of the railway, the rock face of the quarry is high, steep and uneven. A number of trees grow out of the face and large amounts of rubble stone sit at its base. The formation of a siding sits adjacent to the railway within a wide grassed area. A thick wall of concrete is set into a sloping vegetated bank above the siding, flanked by walls of concrete and rubble coursed stone. A large concrete block sits in front of the wall, mounted by a short timber beam attached by steel rods. A timber Queensland Rail sign above the cement work prohibits fossicking. Above the bank a large level grassed area extends to the base of the quarry face.

Spring Bluff railway station
[
edit
]
Spring Bluff railway station, known for its gardens, 2014
The Spring Bluff railway station complex is located 146.17 kilometres (90.83 mi) from Roma Street Station along a large level curve of the Main Range Railway (
). The key features of the site are located on a series of terraces cut into the escarpment of the main range, on the north side of the railway, surrounded by native vegetation composed predominantly of open eucalypt forest. A station building and platform, railway residences, timber pavilion and other built structures are placed among expansive landscaped gardens and open grassed areas.
[1]
Garden beds with stone terracing and beds with retaining walls of stone, timber or concrete occur on both sides of the railway. In a garden bed below the Fettler's Quarters, large white stones set into concrete form the words: Spring Bluff. A mixture of exotic and native trees and shrubs are scattered among the site. Prominent plantings include a large clump of bamboo next to the station building and a nearby London Plane tree (platanus acerifolia) (1870) with a commemorative plaque at its base.
[1]
Facilities for recreation on the grounds include picnic tables, a cricket pitch and a railway carriage used for refreshments. Left of the railway, adjacent to a fenced bitumen carpark, is a modern Queensland Rail residence. A crossing loop runs along the extent of the station.
[1]
Station Building and Signal Cabin

edit
]
The Spring Bluff Station building is a single storeyed rectangular timber structure, centrally positioned on the south-east facing station platform. The building is timber-framed and clad with
chamferboards
, except for the rear elevation, which has exposed stud framing to the shelter shed and ladies waiting room (which appear to be the earliest sections of the building). The whole is set on low set concrete stumping. A gabled roof of corrugated iron projects towards the platform, supported by curved and chamfered timber
brackets
with single-faced bosses.
[1]
The building comprises four sections: ladies waiting room, shelter shed, office and an electric staff instruments room.
[1]
At the north-east end of the building is the ladies waiting room. This has a four-panel timber door with fanlight and a sash window to the platform. At the rear corner of the waiting room, horizontal timber louvres form a window and a small door provides access at the base. There is a double-hung sash window in the rear wall.
[1]
Adjoining is the shelter shed with timber bench seats around the walls, two sets of pivoting timber shutters on the rear wall and a floor lined with timber boards. The rear wall is lined with horizontal beaded tongue and groove joinery. The north-east internal wall has vertical tongue and groove lining, with a high small hinged door opening from the waiting room. The south-west internal wall is lined with chamferboards. Interpretative and other panels are mounted on the walls.
[1]
Adjoining the waiting area is the office. The elevation to the platform has a sash window and a four-panel timber door with fanlight. A mail slot is inserted into the chamferboard cladding. There is a double-hung sash window in the rear wall.

[1]
At the north-east end of the platform is a two-lever ground frame. At either end of the platform are timber signs displaying the name of the station: Spring Bluff.
[1]
Set in against the hillside at the rear of the building, is a coursed stone wall incorporating the remnants of an arched brick fireplace.
[1]
Immediately adjacent to the station building, at its south-west end, is a detached signal cabin. This is a small square structure with a skillion roof, clad with metal sheeting, and has aluminium-framed windows. A modern water tank collects rainwater from gutters of the signal cabin. The signal cabin building and the rain water tank are not of cultural heritage significance, but the cabin houses two culturally significant elements: a steel, 15 lever frame, set into timber floorboards, and a timber-framed cabin diagram mounted on the rear wall.
[1]
Next to the water tank a long flight of exterior timber stairs leads to the gardens and the Station Masters House.
[1]
Set high into the hillside above the railway at the rear of a large landscaped area, three timber buildings, all former railway residences, extend to the west.
[1]
Station Master's House

Heritage listing
[
edit
]
Main Range Railway was listed on the
Queensland Heritage Register
on 5 February 2009 having satisfied the following criteria.
[1]
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The Main Range Railway is important in demonstrating the pattern of development in Queensland, as a major government investment in infrastructure to facilitate the economic development of Queensland. An immense undertaking for its time (1865-1867), involving a large workforce and a dramatic alteration of the landscape, the Main Range Railway is one of Queensland's most significant early public works.
[1]
The Main Range Railway is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's railway network and the objective behind its establishment. The Main Range Railway inaugurated the pattern of extending Queensland railways westwards from ports across the Dividing Range to assist the development of inland Queensland.
[1]
The Main Range Railway (constructed 1865-1867) was the earliest railway crossing of the Great Dividing Range in Queensland and in Australia, opening earlier than the Zig Zag Railway in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, under construction from 1863 to 1869. It is also believed to be the world's first main line narrow gauge railway.
[1]
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
The substantially intact tunnels of the Main Range Railway demonstrate a rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage, being among Australia's earliest railway tunnels built in the 1860s.
[1]
Tunnel 8 demonstrates a rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage as the only example of a side gallery on a railway tunnel thought to exist in Australia.
[1]
The gardens of Spring Bluff Station demonstrate a practice once common but now rare: beautifying railway station grounds for the aesthetic appreciation of train passengers and visitors.
[1]
The Ruthven Street overbridge is Queensland's oldest extant metal rail overbridge with a length of approximately 40 feet (12 m). The overbridge features a now rare use of brick abutments for a railway bridge. They are thought to be the oldest surviving examples of this type in Queensland.
[1]
The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.
Where locations of former campsites still exist within the railway reserve on the Main Range, there is potential to reveal information on the organisation and domestic life of 1860s railway camps in Queensland.
[1]
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
The Main Range rail ascent is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a railway range crossing. The railway climbs from Murphy's Creek at the base of the Great Dividing Range to the summit at Harlaxton. Along the route engineering features responded to challenging and variable terrain, as demonstrated in the provision of nine tunnels, numerous culverts, cuttings and embankments, and extensive use of curved track. The line originally included the construction of 47 bridges (mostly timber), but these have been gradually replaced by culverts and embankments.
[1]
In particular, the tunnels of the Main Range Railway demonstrate the high quality of work of Engineer-In-Chief Robert Ballard, who was appointed specifically for his expertise in this field of railway engineering.
[1]
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.
The Main Range Railway is important because of its aesthetic significance. The railway offers an array of different built and natural landscapes to experience. Cuttings, tunnels and other built features are a tangible illustration of the extraordinary human endeavour required to make the railway a reality. Sections of the winding railway can be seen making its way up the range. Constantly changing and frequently spectacular vistas of steep timbered hills, gullies and distant ranges extend south-east to the coastal plain.
[1]
The assemblage of landscaped gardens, railway buildings and natural setting at Spring Bluff station are a distinctive and highly picturesque feature of the Main Range Railway.
[1]
The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.
The Main Range Railway is important in demonstrating a high degree of technical achievement in 1860s Queensland. As part of the main line between Ipswich and Toowoomba, the Main Range Railway ascent, Queensland's first range rail crossing, utilised the medium of narrow gauge on a size and scale previously unknown, either in the Australian colonies or in other countries. Over challenging and variable terrain and an incline close to 365 metres (1,198 ft), the Main Range Railway demonstrates the extent of engineering necessary to construct the route, as evidenced in the substantial use of tightly curved track, tunnels, culverts, cuttings, embankments and bridges.

Benümb
was an American
grindcore
band from
Millbrae, California
.
[2]
Biography
[
edit
]
Formed in 1994 in Oakland, California, Benümb became known within the local hardcore community as a respected grindcore band. The band went through various lineup changes during their early years. After playing together for almost a year, a
split 7-inch
with Short Hate Temper was released in mid-1995 on the Same Day label. Benümb spent the next year and a half playing shows with bands including
Man is the Bastard
,
Spazz
,
Exhumed
,
Dystopia
and
Capitalist Casualties
, among others. In 1997 the band recorded and released numerous
7-inch records
, including splits with Dukes of Hazzard and Apartment 213. Their live set at the "Fiesta Grande" festival was recorded and released as part of the
Fiesta Comes Alive!
LP on
Slap-a-Ham Records
. In late 1997 the
Gear in the Machine
7-inch was released on the
Relapse
7-inch series, and in 1998 a live split with Suppression, pressed on a
flexi-disc
, accompanied issue No. 3 of the fanzine
Monkeybite
.
In May 1998, Benümb released their first full-length album,
Soul of the Martyr
. The album was described as angry and intense, and contained 19 bonus tracks taken from previous splits and live performances.
[3]
Soul of the Martyr
was well received, and the band promoted the release by completing several mini-tours of the United States. Benümb also appeared at every major U.S. heavy music festival in the two years that followed, including the 1998 and 1999 Milwaukee Metalfests and the 1998 and 1999 March Metal Meltdowns.
In 2000, Benümb released the album
Withering Strands of Hope
. The album was produced by Bart Thurber (Spazz, Exhumed) at Oakland's House Of Faith. Guitarist Robb Koperski parted ways with the band in early 2001 due to personal issues. In Spring 2002, Benümb released a split
3" CD
with labelmates
Pig Destroyer
. This split showed an evolution in the band's sound with the return of Paul Ponitkoff on guitar.
Benümb released
By Means of Upheaval
on Relapse Records in 2003, and a split with Premonitions of War in 2005.
By Means of Upheaval
continued the band's angry, punk-leaning grindcore sound, political lyrics, and short songs.
[4]
The band broke up in 2006. Pete Ponitkoff and John Gotelli have since formed Agenda of Swine, and have released an album on Relapse Records.

History
[
edit
]
Edmark was founded in 1970 by Gordon B. Bleil by combining the assets of Educational Aids and Services Co. a small supplier of educational materials and programs and L-Tec Systems Inc. which had developed programs from its research. The Child Development and Mental Retardation Center of the University of Washington under the direction of Dr. Sidney Bijou had conducted research into the operant conditioning and reinforcement theories of B.F. Skinner as applicable to human learning. From this research, they developed academic programs which for the first time proved the viability of teaching reading to people with severe mental limitations. Bleil adapted this research into The Edmark Reading Program which for the next decade was the principal product of the company.
Bleil left the company to return to banking in 1980 and retained no interest in the company.
They began developing software in 1992.

Lipowiec
is a district (
osiedle
) of
Ustroń
,
Silesian Voivodeship
, Poland. It was a separate municipality, but became administratively a part of Ustroń on January 1, 1973.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of
Diocese of Wrocław
called
Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis
from around 1305 as
item in
Lypowetz
.
[2]
[3]
[4]
It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a
tithe
from was not yet precised). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as
Upper Silesia
.
Politically the village belonged initially to the
Duchy of Teschen
, formed in 1290 in the process of
feudal fragmentation of Poland
and was ruled by a local branch of
Piast dynasty
. In 1327 the duchy became a
fee
of the
Kingdom of Bohemia
, which after 1526 became part of the
Habsburg monarchy
.
The village became a seat of a Catholic
parish
, first mentioned in an incomplete register of
Peter's Pence
payment from 1335 as
Lipovecz
[5]
and as such being one of the oldest in the region. However local parish quickly ceased to exist and was not mentioned among local parishes in 1447.
[6]
In years 1573/1577-1594 it belonged to
Skoczów
-
Strumień
state country
that was split from the Duchy of Teschen but was later purchased back.
[7]
Since 1653 it belonged to
Teschener Kammer
.
After
Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire
a modern
municipal division
was introduced in the re-established
Austrian Silesia
. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the
political district
of
Bielsko
and the
legal district
of
Skoczów
. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 936 in 1880 to 961 in 1910, with majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (98.5%-99.9%) and a small German-speaking minority (most 12 or 1.3% in 1880) and at most two people Czech-speaking (in 1880 and 1890), in terms of religion majority were
Roman Catholics
(88.2% in 1910), followed by
Protestants
(11.6% in 1910) and
Jews
(2 people).
[8]
The village was also traditionally inhabited by
Cieszyn Vlachs
, speaking
Cieszyn Silesian dialect
.
After
World War I
, fall of
Austria-Hungary
,
Polish-Czechoslovak War
and the division of
Cieszyn Silesia
in 1920, it became a part of
Poland
. It was then
annexed
by
Nazi Germany
at the beginning of
World War II
. After the war it was restored to
Poland
.

"
Hold Tight!
" is a song by
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich
. The song was recorded on 11 January 1966 at
Fontana
's studio in Marble Arch, London and released as a single in February 1966. It was included on
the band's debut album
, issued on 24 June 1966.
The song reached number 4 on the
UK Singles Chart
.
[2]
This was their first top ten hit, also reaching number 27 on the Australian
Kent Music Report
and number 8 on the
New Zealand Singles Chart
. The song did not chart on the US
Billboard
Hot 100
, with the band achieving limited success in America.
The song was used in the
soundtrack
to the 2007
Quentin Tarantino
film
Death Proof
, in which Jungle Julia (
Sydney Tamiia Poitier
) requests the song, calling in to the radio station for which she works. She erroneously refers to the band as "Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich".
[3]
[4]
It is based on a rhythm used as a chant by football fans.
[5]
An Italian language version, Chi Sei? by I Monelli, was used in a UK TV advertisement in 2023 by
EasyJet
.
[6]
[7]
Reception
[
edit
]
Reviewing for
New Musical Express
, Derek Johnson wrote that "the stamping drum opening sounds like a
Dave Clark
disc - then in comes a grating rasp guitar and plonking bass, to build the rhythm to a pitch before the vocals start. The song itself goes up, line by line, in octaves - so that Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich are in
falsetto
at the end of each stanza".
[8]
For
Record Mirror
,
Peter Jones
described the song as a "highly effective hit-parade follow-up with a beat based on a current clapping craze at football grounds".

Joe De Sena
(born January 2, 1969) is the CEO and founder of
Spartan
and the Death Race.
[1]
He is also a
NY Times
best selling author of Spartan Up,
[2]
Spartan Fit
[3]
and The Spartan Way.
[4]
Early life
[
edit
]
Joe De Sena grew up in
Howard Beach
,
Queens
, with his mother Jean, a yoga aficionado,
[5]
and his father, Ralph was a business owner. De Sena built a small business around selling fireworks, and then a t-shirt sales business at a young age.
[6]
Joe later began a pool cleaning business while a teenager, where he earned 750 customers in his local area. Joe eventually moved with his mother and sister to
Ithaca, NY
, and four years out of high school he attended
Cornell University
. He eventually restarted the pool cleaning business and later sold it for $500,000. Following this, he began a career on
Wall Street
.
[7]
At a brokerage firm De Sena worked as an equities and derivatives trader
[8]
and engaged various outdoor activities ranging from multiple IronMan races, to the Iditarod by foot.
[9]
Racing career
[
edit
]
De Sena first became interested in long-distance events after gaining weight while holding his desk job, and trying to reverse the process through running the stairs of his apartment building. He later moved to Vermont in order to continue a private stock trading business.
[7]
He moved his family as well to
Pittsfield, Vermont
to operate a farm, a bed and breakfast, and a general store for hikers
[10]
that he purchased.
[11]
Here he became an
ultramarathon
runner and began to compete in other long-distance events.
[12]
This included athletic events like the
Ironman
and the Furnace Creek 508 Bike Race,
[10]
as De Sena competed in several hundred extreme races after moving.
[13]
In one year, De Sena completed fifty ultra events and fourteen Ironmans.
[6]
Spartan Race
[
edit
]
Main article:
Spartan Race
In 2000, De Sena's team became stranded in the Quebec wilderness during a 350-mile winter adventure race, when he had to dig himself beneath the snow to survive. It was here that he claims he made a distinction between "difficult" situations and "desperate" experience, and inspired him to create his own endurance races. De Sena decided to develop a new series of obstacle course races
[11]
and cofounded the Death Race.  The first edition in 2007 saw only eight competitors, with three completing the race.
[7]
The original race is still held at De Sena's farm, where in 2014 only forty of three hundred entrants completed the race. He also hosts individuals at his farm for long-term personalized outdoor training.
[11]
In 2008 De Sena began the Peak.com Corporation to promote endurance sports, including Peak and Spartan.
[14]
In addition to running the Death Race
[15]
and Peak.com De Sena founded the Spartan in 2009 as a less strenuous obstacle course test.
[7]
He is currently serving as the company's CEO.
[16]
In August 2012, the
Raptor Group
, an equity firm run by
Jim Pallotta
, invested in Spartan with John Burns from Raptor Consumer Partners joining the Board of Directors for Spartan.  Spartan continues to grow and currently hosts more than 200 events in 40 countries across the world, with over one million annual participants.
[17]
The new venture began as Spartan Race unveiled a new stadium series of races beginning with
Fenway Park
. In 2013, Spartan Race expanded the stadium series to include CITI Field, Miller and AT&T parks.
[9]
Writing
[
edit
]
De Sena is a contributor to publications including
Entrepreneur
.

In 2014 he published the book
Spartan Up: A Take-No-Prisoners Guide to Overcoming Obstacles and Achieving Peak Performance in Life
,
[19]
co-authored with Jeff O'Connell.
[20]
In 2016 he followed up that book with

The
Damara,
plural
Damaran
(
Khoekhoegowab
:
ǂNūkhoen
,
Black people
,
German
:
Bergdamara
, referring to their extended stay in hilly and mountainous sites, also called at various times the
Daman
or the
Damaqua
) are an
ethnic group
who make up 8.5% of
Namibia's
population. They speak the
Khoekhoe language
(like the
Nama people
) and the majority live in the northwestern regions of Namibia, however they are also found widely across the rest of the country.
Genetic studies have found that Damara are closely related to neighbouring
Himba
and
Herero
people, consistent with an origin from Bantu speakers who shifted to a different language and culture.
[2]
[3]
Their name in their own language is the
"Daman"
(where the
"-n"
is just the Khoekhoe plural ending). The name
"Damaqua"
stems from the addition of the Khoekhoe suffix
"-qua/khwa"
meaning "people" (found in the names of other Southern African peoples like the
Namaqua
and the
Griqua
).
[4]
Prior to 1870 the hunter-gatherer Damaran occupied most of central Namibia they used to practice pastoralism with sheep and cattle, but were also agriculturalist planting pumpkins, corn, tobacco. The Damaran were also copper-smiths known for their ability to melt copper and used to make ornaments, jewellery, knives and spear heads out of iron. The Damaran just like the Sān believed in communal ownership of land meaning that no individual owned land as God had given land to everyone. Thus, rather than one person owning good grazing land and another seeking out an existence, all would live in harmony. It was for this reason that many were displaced when the Nama and
Herero
began to occupy this area in search of better grazing. Thereafter the Damara were dominated by the Namaqua and the Herero, most living as servants in their households.
[5]
In 1960, the South African government forced the Damara into the
bantustan
of
Damaraland
, an area of poor soil and irregular rainfall. About half of their numbers still occupy Damaraland.

According to written accounts of the history of the Damaran which dates back to the leadership of the Damaras as far back as the 14th century (1390), substantiated by archaeological and ethnological evidence reflected to those records, the Damaran next to the Sān, are the first inhabitants of what is today known as Namibia. Oral tradition has it that the Damaran came to Namibia from ǁKhaus (Equatorial Rainforest) through ǃĀǂkhib centuries ago.
The Damaran initially settled between Huriǂnaub (
Kunene River
) and ǃGûǁōb (
Kavango River
), before entering what later-on centuries long after became known as ǀNaweǃhūb (
Ovamboland
). The Damaran moved southwards and were living peacefully as a single group in the area that is a stone's throw and an eagle's flight in the surrounding of Dâureb (
Brandberg Mountain
),
Paresis Mountains
, ǃHōb (
Waterberg
), the
Omatako Mountains
,
Otavi Mountains
and ǃOeǂgâb (
Erongo Mountains
). Oral and written historical records have it that intruders, reportedly under the leadership of a certain Mukumbi (Mûtsixubi) invaded that area in 1600, and clashed with the Damaran.
The Damaran dispersed in splinter groups as a result of the aftermath of this battle wherein the then Damara Gaob (King), Gaob ǀNarimab succumbed due to injuries sustained in the battle. The Damara, besides the ǀGowanîn, splinter groups then settled all over the country in areas where there was an abundant water and shelter in the form of mountains.
Remnants of the group that was led by Gaob ǀNarimab who dispersed moved eastwards and settled in the ǀGowas, also known as ǀŪmâs (Kalahari Desert) and got the name ǀGowanîn (Damaran of the Kalahari- later referred to as the Sand Kaffers by the imperialist Germans). Another group fled to mountainous central Namibia seeking shelter in ǀKhomas (Khomas Hochland), ǃAoǁaexas Mountains, ǂĒros (Eros Mountains) and ǀAu-ās (Auas Mountains) and became known as the ǀKhomanin (Damaran of the [ǀKhomas] mountains), later referred to as the Berg Damara.
The group that remained in and around ǃOeǂgâb (Erongo Mountains) and settled nearby present-day ǀÂǂgommes (
Okombahe
) got to be known as the ǃOeǂgân (Damaran of the Erongo Mountain).
There were also two other groups that moved down the Tsoaxub (
Swakop River
) and ǃKhuiseb (
Kuiseb River
) respectively, namely the Tsoaxudaman and the ǃKhuisedaman.
Another group, the |Gaiodaman, moved towards the area of ǃKhuidiǁgams (
Omaruru
) and Parase!homgu (Paresis Mountains), and later-on moved back to area west of ǃHob (Waterberg). During the 1904 wars with the German colonial forces, some members of the ǀGaiodaman fled with the Ovaherero to Piriǃhūb (Botswana), whereas some settled at ǀŪgowas in the vicinity of ǃHob (Waterberg Mountain).
The major group of Damaras fled down towards the south, as far as the ǃGarib (
Orange River
) and settled in that area, and installed Gaob !Gariseb as their leader. This group moved back northwards around 1670, and settled at ǂKhanubes, wherefrom they moved and split into two groups, one of which settled in the vicinity of ǂAixorobes (
Tsumeb
) and the other one led by Gaob ǀNarirab settled at |Haigomab!gaus, south-east of
Otjituuo
. The latter-mentioned group split up in four (4) factions:
One group moved to the ǃHoaruseb River, and systematically down towards the Atlantic Ocean following the said river and settling on its banks, and they became known as the ǃNaranin and ǃHoarusedaman respectively.
The other group moved to the ǁHuanib River, and inhabited the area of ǃNani|audi (
Sesfontein
), and was called by the name ǁHuanidaman.
The third faction moved towards the Dâureb (Brandberg) and got the name Dâuredaman and ǃNamidaman.
The last faction moved towards Anibira-āhes (
Fransfontein
), and Aroǃhūb area, and they were later joined by the ǂAodaman who moved thereto from the Paresis Mountains.
The remainder of clans not mentioned above came into existence as a result of fractions in they already mentioned clans.

Culture
[
edit
]
The Damara are divided into clans, each headed by a chief, with a King,
Justus ǁGaroëb
, over the whole Damara people. Prince ǀHaihāb, Chief Xamseb, and ǁGuruseb were among the richest and most powerful chiefs.
Damara males were not
circumcised
. However, groups of boys were initiated into manhood through an elaborate hunting ritual. This ritual is repeated twice, for teenagers and grown men, after which the initiates are considered clan elders.
[8]
Their traditional clothing colors are green, white, and blue. Green and blue identify the different sub-groups. Some women may wear white and blue or white and green, the white representing peace and unity among all Damara-speaking people.
The women do household chores like cooking, cleaning, and gardening. Their primary duty is milking the cows in the morning and nurturing the young. Men traditionally hunt and herd the cattle, leaving the village as early as the sunrise, patrolling their area to protect their cattle and grazing ground as tradition dictates. Men can be very aggressive towards intruders if not notified of any other male presence in a grazing area.
Though many Damara people own and live on rural farms, the majority live in the small towns scattered across the Erongo region or in Namibia's capital city of
Windhoek
. Those that still live on farms tend to live in extended family groups of as many as one hundred, creating small villages of family members.
The Damara are rich in cattle and sheep. Some chiefs possess up to 8,000 head of horned cattle.
Religion
[
edit
]
The supreme deity of the Damaran (ǂNūkhoen) is
ǁGamab
, also referred to as
ǁGammāb
(provider of water),
ǁGauna
(Sān),
ǁGaunab
(Khoekhoe) and Haukhoin (
Khoekhoe
:
foreigners
) by the Khoekhoe.
He lives in a high heaven, even above the heaven of the stars. ǁGamab, from ǁGam,
Khoekhoe
:
water
, and mā,
Khoekhoe
:
give
is provider of the water and thus associated with the rising clouds, thunder, lightning and water. He ensured the annual renewal of nature being the cycle of the seasons and supplied game animals to the ǃgarob (
Khoekhoe
:
veld
) and the Damaran. One of his chief responsibilities is to warrant the growth of crops.
ǁGamab is also the God of Death, directing the fate of mankind. He shoots arrows at humans from his place above the skies and those struck fall ill and die. After death, the souls of the dead make their way to ǁGamab's village in the heaven above stars and gather around him at a ritual fire. Then he offers them a drink from a bowl of liquid fat to drink, as a reward.
ǁGamab's arch-enemy is the evil ǁGaunab.

The Damara made use of animal hides for clothing. The principal animal hides that were used were those of springbok and goats for clothing and sheep and jackal for blankets. Damaran traditional attires differentiated between a girl, an unmarried or married woman and an elderly woman in the same manner that it differentiated between boys, unmarried and married men and men of age. Some outfits were reserved for special ceremonies in contrast to everyday garments.
A girl in a Damara context is any female that has not yet undergone the menstrual cycle while a boy is any male that has not yet undergone the first hunting ritual. A girl stays in the house for the duration of her first menstrual cycle.  A hunting ritual was performed in the Damara culture as Damara males were not circumcised. The first hunting ritual was performed by boys in order to become man and the second by man to become community elders. All Damara children regardless of sex wore a
ǃgaes
, an apron like loin-cloth that covers genitalia. Girls would at a tender age undergo the
ǂgaeǂnoas
(have earring holes made) after which black thread would be inserted until such a time they will first start wearing
ǃgamdi
(earrings).
A man in the Damara context is any male that has undergone the first hunting ritual while a woman is any female that has experienced the menstrual cycle. The Damara culture would continue to differentiate between a married and unmarried man or woman. An unmarried man is called an
axa-aob
while a woman is an
oaxaes
. An unmarried man would simply wear a
ǁnaweb
which is a loin-cloth that is tucked in between the legs while an unmarried woman wore a
ǃgaes
to cover genitalia and a
ǀgâubes
to cover the rears.
A married man that has a child or children is called an
aob
, while a married woman with children is a
taras
. Such a man would wear a
sorab
which is a strip of soft leather worn between legs. Both ends are tucked under thong around waist and flapped over at front and the back. They would also wear a
danakhōb
which is the skin of any smallish animal that the wife presents to her husband at their wedding to wear on his head. The men would wear the "head hide" to ceremonies and on auspicious occasions to show that he is the head of a household. The hide would preferably be of a
ǃnoreb
(a
common genet
). Married women just like girls would wear a
ǀgâubes
(rear loincloth) and would wear a
ǀawiǃgaes
(loincloth consisting of strips) instead of a regular
ǃgaes
. A
ǁkhaikhōb
would also be worn only to ceremonies and on auspicious occasions, but mostly during pregnancy and by elder women on a daily basis. The ǁkhaikhōb is the hide of a medium-sized antelope most preferably a
ǀhauib
(a
Damara dik-dik
) or a
dôas
,
ǀnâus
(
Duiker
) that is worn to cover breast and the abdomen (during pregnancy).
An elderly man,
kaikhoeb
, is any Damara male that has undergone the second and last hunting ritual. An elderly woman, a
kaikhoes
, is a female or a lady (khaokhoes) that has concluded her menstrual cycle. All elderly men and women would wear a
ǃgūb
, which is a skirt-like loin-cloth or traditional skirt for men and women. Elderly women would also wear a
ǁkhaikhōb
and sometimes a
khōǃkhaib
(headgear fashioned of soft hide).
Women being more aware of beautification would wear
ǃgamdi
(small traditional earrings made from iron and or copper) and wear necklaces made of
ostrich egg shells
known as a ǁnûib in Khoekhoegowab. Women wore ǃganudi (arm bangles) and ǃgoroǃkhuidi (ornamental anklets) they also originally made from iron and or copper later replaced by beads and or ostrich egg shells. An anklet made from moth larvae (ǀkhîs) was also worn but only during performances/dances along with a tussled apron known as a ǀhapis (for females) and or ǀhapib (for males)
ǃNau-i (traditional facial foundation) also played a significant part in Damara and the wider Khoekhoe cosmetics. Women would ǀīǃnâ (perfume) hides and blankets by stewing buchu on hot stones placed under a ǀīǃnâs (dome-shaped basket) after which they would boro themselves (smear red ochre on their faces) early in the morning. They would also sprinkle some sâ-i (buchu powder) on their hides and blankets with a ǃūro-ams (powder-puff made from a piece of hare fur used to pluck ǃūros (tortoise-shell container, carried by women for holding sâ-i) to power oneself.)
Man also wore arm bangles (ǃganugu) and ǃgoroǃkhuigu (anklets) which were unadorned in design and denser than those of women. A strand of beads that criss-crossed the chess known as a karab was also worn by men. Tsaob (ash) was used as an anti-perspiring agent by the Damaran as they believe that it is the purest substance on Earth.
Contemporary traditional attire
[
edit
]
The replacement of animal hides with fabrics has also been visible in the Damara culture as the aforementioned outfits are mostly worn to cultural ceremonies and on auspicious occasions. Thus the Damaran sought for a perfect substitution for animal hides and introduced the Damarokoes (Damara dress). The Damarokoes was adopted from missionary wives in the mid-19th century and was introduced due to the Christianisation of the Damaran as missionaries saw the animal hides as "primitive and exposing". The dress adopted to cover up the "nude" Damara women ensured just that with its ankle-lengthiness and long sleeves and a ǃkhens (shawl) to ensure maximum coverage.
The Dama ǃkhaib (headgear) is a unique innovation of the Damara women as they shaped a headgear that can be fashionable yet work effective as they still could ǂkhao (carry/load something on head) water containers and firewood. It is not only the ǃkhaib that was fashionable and work effective but also the sleeves as the sleeves have a protruding elbow design allowing the elbow to contract and release without constrains. The length of the dress is also fashionable and work effective as it is not too long so as to be caught by twigs, branches and or thorns.
Damara men on the other hand were shirts, coats and or blazers with Damara colours being blue, white and green, sometimes with print or embroidery.

elements
[1]
—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.
[2]
[3]
Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the
divine
,
[4]
sacredness
,
[5]
faith
,
[6]
and a supernatural being or beings.
[7]
Religious practices may include
rituals

trances
,
initiations
,

. Religions have
sacred histories
and
narratives
, which may be preserved in
sacred texts
,
symbols
, and
holy places
, that primarily aim to give life
meaning
. Religions may contain symbolic tales that may attempt to explain the
origin of life
, the
universe
, and other phenomena; some followers believe these to be true stories. Traditionally, both faith and reason have been considered sources of religious beliefs.
[8]
There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide,
[9]
though nearly all of them have regionally based, relatively small followings. Four religions—
Christianity
,
Islam
,
Hinduism
, and
Buddhism
—account for over 77% of the world's population, and 92% of the world either follows one of those four religions or identifies as
nonreligious
,
[10]
meaning that the remaining 9,000+ faiths account for only 8% of the population combined. The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion,
atheists
, and
agnostics
, although many in the demographic still have various religious beliefs.
[11]
Many
world religions
are also
organized religions
, most definitively including the
Abrahamic religions
Christianity
, Islam, and Judaism, while others are arguably less so, in particular
folk religions
,
indigenous religions

Etymology

History of religion
The term
religion
comes from both
Old French
and
Anglo-Norman
(1200s
CE
) and means respect for sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity, what is sacred, reverence for the gods.
[15]
[16]
It is ultimately derived from the
Latin
word
religiō
. According to Roman philosopher
Cicero
,
religiō
comes from
relegere
:
re
(meaning "again") +
lego
(meaning "read"), where
lego
is in the sense of "go over", "choose", or "consider carefully". Contrarily, some modern scholars such as
Tom Harpur
and
Joseph Campbell
have argued that
religiō
is derived from
religare
:
re
(meaning "again") +
ligare
("bind" or "connect"), which was made prominent by
St. Augustine
following the interpretation given by
Lactantius
in
Divinae institutiones
, IV, 28.
[17]
[18]
The medieval usage alternates with
order
in designating bonded communities like those of
monastic orders
: "we hear of the 'religion' of the
Golden Fleece
, of a knight 'of the
religion of Avys
'".
[19]
Religiō
Main article:
Religio
In classic antiquity,
religiō
broadly meant
conscientiousness
, sense of
right
, moral
obligation
, or
duty
to anything.
[20]
In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root
religiō
was understood as an individual virtue of
worship
in mundane contexts; never as
doctrine
, practice, or actual source of
knowledge
.
[21]
[22]
In general,
religiō
referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards
God
.
[23]
Religiō
was most often used by the
ancient Romans
not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context such as
hesitation
, caution,
anxiety
, or
fear
, as well as feelings of being bound, restricted, or inhibited.
[24]
The term was also closely related to other terms like
scrupulus
(which meant "very precisely"), and some Roman authors related the term
superstitio
(which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame) to
religiō
at times.
[24]
When
religiō
came into
English
around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of "life bound by monastic vows" or monastic orders.
[19]
[23]
The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious and
worldly
things were separated, was not used before the 1500s.
[23]
The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the
church
and the domain of
civil authorities
; the
Peace of Augsburg
marks such instance,
[23]
which has been described by
Christian Reus-Smit
as "the first step on the road toward a European system of
sovereign states
."
[25]
Roman general
Julius Caesar
used
religiō
to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.
[26]
Roman naturalist
Pliny the Elder
used the term
religiō
to describe the apparent respect given by elephants to the
night sky
.
[27]
Cicero used
religiō
as being related to
cultum deorum
(worship of the gods).
[28]
Threskeia
In
Ancient Greece
, the Greek term
threskeia
(
θρησκεία
) was loosely translated into Latin as
religiō
in
late antiquity
.
Threskeia
was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of
Josephus
in the 1st century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others, to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word
deisidaimonia
, which meant too much fear.
[29]
History of the concept of the "religion"
See also:
Timeline of religion
Religion is a modern concept.
[30]
The concept was invented recently in the English language and is found in texts from the 17th century due to events such as the splitting of
Christendom
during the
Protestant Reformation
and
globalization
in the
Age of Exploration
, which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.
[21]
[22]
[31]
Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures,
[32]
[33]
while some followers of various faiths rebuke using the word to describe their own belief system.
[34]
The concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries,
[35]
[36]
despite the fact that ancient sacred texts like the
Bible
, the
Quran
, and others did not have a word or even a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.
[37]
[38]
For example, there is no precise equivalent of religion in Hebrew, and
Judaism
does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.
[39]
[40]
[41]
One of its central concepts is
halakha
, meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law, which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.
[42]
Even though the beliefs and traditions of Judaism are found in the ancient world, ancient Jews saw
Jewish identity
as being about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated rituals.
[43]
In the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term
ioudaismos
(Judaism) as an ethnic term and was not linked to modern abstract concepts of religion or a set of beliefs.
[3]
The very concept of "Judaism" was invented by the
Christian Church
,
[44]
and it was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.
[43]
The Greek word
threskeia
, which was used by Greek writers such as
Herodotus
and Josephus, is found in the
New Testament
.
Threskeia
is sometimes translated as "religion" in today's translations, but the term was understood as generic "worship" well into the
medieval period
.
[3]
In the Quran, the
Arabic
word
din
is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed
din
as "law".
[3]
The
Sanskrit
word
dharma
, sometimes translated as religion,
[45]
also means law. Throughout classical
South Asia
, the
study of law
consisted of concepts such as
penance through piety
and
ceremonial as well as practical traditions
. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between imperial law and universal or Buddha law, but these later became independent sources of power.
[46]
[47]
Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with Western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and
world religions
first entered the English language.
[48]
[49]
[50]
Native Americans were also thought of as not having religions and also had no word for religion in their languages either.
[49]
[51]
No one self-identified as a Hindu or Buddhist or other similar terms before the 1800s.
[52]
"Hindu" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the
Indian subcontinent
.
[53]
[54]
Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of religion since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this idea.
[55]
[56]
According to the
philologist
Max Müller
in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the Latin
religiō
, was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things,
piety
(which Cicero further derived to mean diligence).
[57]
[58]
Müller characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are, however, two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.
[60]
[61]
[62]
[63]
Modern Western
The concept of religion originated in the
modern era
in the
West
.
[33]
Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.
[3]
[23]
Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.
[64]
[65]
Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.
[32]
[33]
An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.
[66]
They observe that the way the concept today is used is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the
Peace of Westphalia
).
[67]
The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the
dichotomous
Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.
[68]
The anthropologist
Clifford Geertz
defined religion as a:
... system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."
[69]
Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that:
... we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.
[70]
The theologian
Antoine Vergote
took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as:
... the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.
[7]
Peter Mandaville
and
Paul James
intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as:
... a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is
lived
as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.
[71]
According to the
MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions
, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
... almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences ... toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.
[72]
Classical
Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in
Buryatia
Friedrich Schleiermacher
in the late 18th century defined religion as
das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl
, commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".
[73]
His contemporary
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."
[74]
[
better source needed
]
Edward Burnett Tylor
defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".
[75]
He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or
idolatry
and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.
In his book
The Varieties of Religious Experience
, the psychologist
William James
defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".
[4]
By the term divine James meant "any object that is god
like
, whether it be a concrete deity or not"
[76]
to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.
[77]
Sociologist
Émile Durkheim
, in his seminal book
The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life
, defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".
[5]
By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them".
Sacred things
are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.
[note 1]
On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".
[78]
Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.
[79]
Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example,
Frederick Ferré
who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".
[80]
Similarly, for the theologian
Paul Tillich
, faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",
[6]
which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."
[81]
When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by
Richard Dawkins
) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.
[82]
Aspects
Beliefs
Main article:
Religious beliefs
Traditionally,
faith
, in addition to
reason
, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.
[8]
The origin of religious belief as such is an open question, with possible explanations including awareness of individual death, a sense of community, and dreams.
[83]
Mythology
Main article:
Mythology
A manuscript depicting the climactic
Kurukshetra War

Hindu epic
Mahabharata
. The
Mahabharata
is the longest epic poem known and a key source of
Hindu mythology
.
The word
myth
has several meanings:
A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.
[84]
Ancient
polytheistic
religions, such as those of Greece,
Rome
, and
Scandinavia
, are usually categorized under the heading of
mythology
. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or
cultures
in development, are similarly called myths in the
anthropology of religion
. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs.
Joseph Campbell
remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as
other people's
religions, and religion can be defined as misinterpreted mythology."
[85]
In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group, whether or not it is objectively or provably true.
[86]
Examples include the
resurrection
of their real-life founder
Jesus
, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the
symbolism
of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

theories of religion generally attempt to explain the

religious belief
and
practice
.
Origins and development
Main article:
History of religion
The
Yazılıkaya
sanctuary in
Turkey
, with the twelve gods of the underworld
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.
According to
anthropologists
John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success—and many movements come and go with little long-term effect—has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."
[91]
The
development of religion
has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their
laws
and
cosmology
to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places, religion has been associated with public institutions such as
education
,
hospitals
, the
family
,
government
, and
political
hierarchies.
[92]
Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."
[92]
Cultural system
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in
religious studies
courses, was proposed by
Clifford Geertz
, who simply called it a "cultural system".
[93]
A critique of Geertz's model by
Talal Asad
categorized religion as "an
anthropological
category".
[94]
Richard Niebuhr's (1894-1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though with some interplay.
[95]
Social constructionism
Main article:
Social constructionism
One modern academic theory of religion,
social constructionism
, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all
spiritual
practice and
worship
follows a model similar to the
Abrahamic religions
as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.
[96]
Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.
Cognitive science
Main article:
Cognitive science of religion
Further information:
Religion and schizophrenia
Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences.
[97]
The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including:
cognitive psychology
,
evolutionary psychology
,
cognitive anthropology
,
artificial intelligence
,
cognitive neuroscience
,
neurobiology
,
zoology
, and
ethology
. Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.
Hallucinations
and
delusions related to religious content
occurs in about 60% of people with
schizophrenia
. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomena and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.
[98]
[99]
[100]
Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.
[101]
Religious content is also common in
temporal lobe epilepsy
, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder
.
[102]
[103]
Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.
[104]
Comparativism
Main article:
Comparative religion
Comparative religion is the branch of the
study of religions
concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general, the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as
ethics
,
metaphysics
, and the nature and form of
salvation
. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the
sacred
,
numinous
,
spiritual
and
divine
.
[105]
In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification
[106]
of the
main world religions
includes
Middle Eastern religions
(including
Zoroastrianism
and
Iranian religions
),
Indian religions
,
East Asian religions
, African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.
[106]
Classification
Main article:
History of religion
A map of
major denominations and religions of the world
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of
comparative religion
divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics
studying the subject
have divided religions into three broad categories:
World religions
, a term which refers to
transcultural
, international religions;
Indigenous religions
, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
New religious movements
, which refers to recently developed religions.
[107]
Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.
[108]
[109]
[110]
The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).
[111]
[

Morphological classification
Some scholars classify religions as either
universal religions
that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, such as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Jainism, while
ethnic religions
are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.
[112]
[113]
Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.

, 13% as convinced
atheists
, and also a 9% decrease in identification as religious when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries.
[118]
A follow-up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as convinced atheists.
[119]
On average, women are more religious than men.

Unaffiliated populations are projected to drop, even when taking disaffiliation rates into account, due to differences in birth rates.
[124]

Scholars have indicated that
global religiosity may be increasing
due to religious countries having higher birth rates in general.

Written
and
Oral Torah
; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The
Jewish people
were scattered after the destruction of the
Temple in Jerusalem
in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.
[128]
The largest
Jewish religious movements
are
Orthodox Judaism
(
Haredi Judaism
and
Modern Orthodox Judaism
),
Conservative Judaism
and
Reform Judaism
.
[127]
Christianity
Jesus is the central figure of Christianity.
Christianity
is based on the life and teachings of
Jesus
of Nazareth (1st century) as presented in the New Testament.
[129]
The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the
Christ
,
[129]
the
Son of God
, and as
Savior
and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the
Trinity
, which teaches the unity of
Father
,
Son
(Jesus Christ), and
Holy Spirit
as three persons in
one Godhead
. Most Christians can describe their faith with the
Nicene Creed
. As the religion of
Byzantine Empire
in the first millennium and of
Western Europe
during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world via
missionary work
.
[130]
[131]
[132]
It is the
world's largest religion
, with about 2.3 billion followers as of 2015.
[133]
The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
[134]
The
Catholic Church
, led by the
Bishop of Rome
and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a
communion
of 24 Churches
sui iuris
, including the
Latin Church
and 23
Eastern Catholic churches
, such as the
Maronite
Catholic Church.
[134]
Eastern Christianity
, which include
Eastern Orthodoxy
,
Oriental Orthodoxy
, and the
Church of the East
.
Protestantism
, separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century
Protestant Reformation
and is split into thousands of
denominations
. Major branches of Protestantism include
Anglicanism
,
Baptists
,
Calvinism
,
Lutheranism
, and
Methodism
, though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.
[134]
There are also smaller groups, including:
Restorationism
, the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the
apostolic early church
.
Latter-day Saint movement
, founded by
Joseph Smith
in the late 1820s.
Jehovah's Witnesses
, founded in the late 1870s by
Charles Taze Russell
.

Islam
is a
monotheistic
[135]
religion based on the
Quran
,
[135]
one of the
holy books
considered by Muslims to be
revealed
by
God
, and on the
teachings (hadith)
of the
Islamic prophet
Muhammad
, a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the
Abrahamic
prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before
Muhammad
. It is the most widely practiced religion of
Southeast Asia
,
North Africa
,
Western Asia
, and
Central Asia
, while
Muslim-majority countries
also exist in parts of
South Asia
,
Sub-Saharan Africa
, and
Southeast Europe
. There are also several
Islamic republics
, including
Iran
,
Pakistan
,
Mauritania
, and
Afghanistan
. With about 1.8 billion followers (2015), almost a quarter of
earth's population
are
Muslims
.
[136]
Sunni Islam
is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Qur'an, the ahadith (plural of Hadith) which record the
sunnah
, whilst placing emphasis on the
sahabah
.
Shia Islam
is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that
Ali
succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as
Muwahhidism
and
Salafism
.
Other denominations of Islam include
Nation of Islam
,
Ibadi
,
Sufism
,
Quranism
,
Mahdavia
, and
non-denominational Muslims
.
Wahhabism
is the dominant Muslim
schools of thought
in the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
.
Other
Whilst Judaism, Christianity and Islam are commonly seen as the only three Abrahamic faiths, there are smaller and newer traditions which lay claim to the designation as well.
[137]
The
Baháʼí
Lotus Temple in Delhi
For example, the
Baháʼí Faith
is a
new religious movement
that has links to the major Abrahamic religions as well as other religions (e.g., of Eastern philosophy). Founded in 19th-century Iran, it teaches the unity of all religious philosophies
[138]
and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets (Buddha, Mahavira), including its founder
Bahá'u'lláh
. It is an offshoot of
Bábism
. One of its divisions is the
Orthodox Baháʼí Faith
.
[139]
: 48-49
Even smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including
Samaritanism
(primarily in Israel and the
State of Palestine
), the
Rastafari movement
(primarily in Jamaica), and
Druze
(primarily in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel). The Druze faith originally developed out of
Isma'ilism
, and it has sometimes been considered an
Islamic school
by some Islamic authorities, but Druze themselves do not identify as
Muslims
.
[140]
[141]
[142]
Mandaeism
, sometimes also known as Sabianism (after the mysterious
Sabians
mentioned in the Quran, a name historically claimed by several religious groups),
[143]
is a
Gnostic
,
monotheistic
and
ethnic religion
.

Indian religions
Indian religions
are practiced or were founded in the
Indian subcontinent
. They are sometimes classified as the
dharmic religions
, as they all feature
dharma
, the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.
[147]
Hinduism
The
Padmanabhaswamy Temple
is a significant temple of the Hindu god
Vishnu
in
Thiruvananthapuram
, India.
Hinduism
is also called
Vaidika Dharma
, the
dharma
of the
Vedas
,
[148]
although many practitioners refer to their religion as
Sanātana Dharma
("the Eternal Dharma") which refers to the idea that its origins lie beyond
human history
.
Vaidika Dharma
is a
synecdoche
describing the similar philosophies of
Vaishnavism
,
Shaivism
, and
related groups
practiced or founded in the
Indian subcontinent
. Concepts most of them share in common include
karma
,
caste
,
reincarnation
,
mantras
,
yantras
, and
darśana
.
[note 2]
Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religious belief systems,
[149]
[150]
with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.
[151]
Therefore Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world.
Jainism
The 10th century
Gommateshwara statue

Karnataka
Jainism
, taught primarily by
Rishabhanatha
(the founder of
ahimsa
) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of
non-violence
,
truth
and
anekantavada
for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the
Karmas
, and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death (
saṃsāra
), that is, achieving
nirvana
. Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the
Mahavira
as about contemporaneous with the
Buddha
in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical
Parshvanatha
, based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.
[152]
Digambara
Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are
Pravachanasara
and
Samayasara
written by their Prophets
Kundakunda
and
Amritchandra
as their
original canon
is lost.
Shwetambara
Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are
Jain Agamas
, written by their Prophet
Sthulibhadra
.
Buddhism
Wat Mixay Buddhist shrine in
Vientiane
, Laos
Buddhism
was founded by
Siddhartha Gautama
in the 5th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help
sentient beings
end their
suffering (dukkha)
by understanding the
true nature of phenomena
, thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth (
saṃsāra
), that is, achieving
nirvana
.
Theravada
Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in
Sri Lanka
and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the
Pali Canon
.
Mahayana
Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent
in China
and are still relevant
in Vietnam
,
Korea
,
Japan
and to a lesser extent
in Europe and the United States
. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as
Zen
,
Pure Land
, and
Soka Gakkai
.
Vajrayana
Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.
[153]
It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions
[154]
and extends across all of Asia
[155]
(cf.
Mikkyō
).
Two notable new Buddhist sects are
Hòa Hảo
and the
Navayana
(
Dalit Buddhist movement
), which were developed separately in the 20th century.
Sikhism
An 1840 miniature of
Guru Nanak
Sikhism
is a
panentheistic
religion founded on the teachings of
Guru Nanak
and ten successive
Sikh gurus
in 15th-century
Punjab
. It is the
fifth-largest
organized religion
in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs.
[156]
[157]
Sikhs
are expected to embody the qualities of a
Sant-Sipāhī
—a saint-soldier, have control over one's internal
vices
and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the
Guru Granth Sahib
. The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in
Waheguru
—represented by the phrase
ik ōaṅkār
, meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a
praxis
in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

Related aspects
Law
Main article:
Law and religion
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.
[182]
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.
[183]
[184]
Specialists have explored themes in Western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, and discipline and love.
[185]
Common topics of interest include marriage and the family
[186]
and human rights.
[187]
Outside of Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East
[188]
and pagan Rome.
[189]
Studies have focused on
secularization
.
[190]
[191]
In particular, the issue of wearing religious symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.
[192]
Science
Main articles:
Faith and rationality
,
Relationship between religion and science
, and
Epistemology
Science
acknowledges reason and
empirical evidence
; and religions include
revelation
,
faith
and
sacredness
whilst also acknowledging philosophical and
metaphysical
explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.
[193]
The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.
[3]
[21]
The term science emerged in the 19th century out of
natural philosophy
in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature (
natural science
),
[21]
[194]
[195]
and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.
[21]
It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.
[21]
In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (
scientia
) and religion (
religio
) were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.
[21]
In general, the
scientific method
gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop
theories
through elucidation of facts or evaluation by
experiments
and thus only answers
cosmological
questions about the
universe
that can be observed and measured. It develops
theories
of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as
de facto
verities in general parlance, such as the theories of
general relativity
and
natural selection
to explain respectively the mechanisms of
gravity
and
evolution
.
Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.
[196]
Regarding religion and science,
Albert Einstein
states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary.
[197]
Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts
[197]
…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up."
[198]
Morality
Main article:
Morality and religion
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the
Triple Jems of Jainism
,
Judaism's
Halacha
,
Islam's
Sharia
,
Catholicism's
Canon Law
,
Buddhism's
Noble Eightfold Path
, and
Zoroastrianism's
good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.
[199]
Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption,"
[200]
in Christianity, morality can have a
secular basis
.
The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.
Politics
Impact
Main article:
Religion in politics
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries.
[201]
Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of
sharia
, the Islamic law.
[202]
Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as
The Islamic Republic of Iran
. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57 billion people who are
Muslims
. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the
United States
, 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.
[203]
Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress (
Kyrsten Sinema
, D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.
[204]
In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics
[205]
although it used to be much more important. For instance,
same-sex marriage
and
abortion
were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually
Catholic
) doctrine. Several
European leaders are atheists
(e.g.,
France
's former president
Francois Hollande
or Greece's prime minister
Alexis Tsipras
). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance,
India
is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically
[
when?
]
belonged to the lower castes.
[206]
By contrast, countries such as
China
or
Japan
are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.
Secularism

Punjab
in the early 19th century.
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and
secular
institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the population's religious diversity.

Average income correlates negatively with (self-defined) religiosity.
[118]
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.
[207]
In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).
[207]
Sociologist and political economist
Max Weber
has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their
Protestant work ethic
.
[208]
According to a study from 2015,
Christians
hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by
Muslims
(5.8%),
Hindus
(3.3%) and
Jews
(1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification
Irreligion
or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth (while making up only about 20% of the world population, see section on classification).
[209]
Health
Main article:
Impacts of religion on health
Mayo Clinic
researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.
[210]
The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."
[211]
The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.
[212]
According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity."
[213]
An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.

Magical thinking
, and
Magic and religion
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (
deisidaimonia
), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods
superstitio
.
[222]
Ancient Greek historian
Polybius
described superstition in
ancient Rome
as an
instrumentum regni
, an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the
Empire
.
[223]
Superstition has been described as the non-rational establishment of cause and effect.
[224]
Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.
[225]
[226]
Some
atheists
,
deists
, and
skeptics
regard religious belief as superstition.
The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The
Catechism of the Catholic Church
states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110). "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16-22" (para. #2111)

Criticism of atheism
The terms
atheist
(lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g., Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or
nontheistic
. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious.
Irreligion
describes an absence of any religion;
antireligion
describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.
Interfaith cooperation
Main article:
Interfaith dialogue
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse,
[227]
many religious practitioners
[
who?
]
[228]
have aimed to band together in
interfaith
dialogue, cooperation, and
religious peacebuilding
. The first major dialogue was the
Parliament of the World's Religions
at the 1893
Chicago World's Fair
, which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures.
[229]
The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with
Christian-Jewish reconciliation
representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.
[230]
Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,
[231]
the "C1 World Dialogue",
[232]
the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,
[233]
and a
United Nations
sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".
[234]
[235]
Culture
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related.
[45]
Paul Tillich
looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.
[236]
In his own words:
Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.
[237]
Ernst Troeltsch
, similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it.
[238]
However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.
[239]
Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.
[240]
Criticism
Main article:
Criticism of religion
Criticism of religion is
criticism
of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of religion, including its political and social implications.

History of Anguilla
Afro-Anguillians at Carnival
Before the arrival of Europeans in the Caribbean, Anguilla was inhabited by Arawakan-speaking
Native Americans
who called the Island Malliouhana. Anguilla was colonized in 1650 by British settlers from
Saint Kitts
and thereafter become a British colony. The British did not encounter any Arawaks in Anguilla, but in 1656 a raid by Native Americans from one of the neighbouring islands wiped out their settlement. The early years were difficult for the European colonists.  Due to increase demand for sugar in Europe, British colonizers began producing sugarcane using enslaved Africans.

Executive branch of a sołectwo
For other uses, see
Soltys (disambiguation)
.
A sign representing sołtys' property
A
sołtys
(
Polish pronunciation:
[ˈsɔwtɨs]
) is a head of a
sołectwo
elected by its permanent citizens in a village meeting (
zebranie wiejskie
). According to data from 2010, Poland had 40 thousand sołtys, 30.7% of which were women.
[1]
Role and powers
[
edit
]
Since 1990, a sołtys is an
executive
of a sołectwo that is supported by a sołectwo council. The detailed powers, duties and responsibilities of the sołtys are decided in the
statute
made by the gmina council. The sołtys can use the legal protection of a
civil servant
in his favour.
[2]
Duties
[
edit
]
A sołtys has the duty to:
Represent the sołectwo
Organise village meetings
Introduce laws made by the gmina to the sołectwo
Collect taxes
Participate in gmina council meetings
History
[
edit
]
The office of the sołtys was introduced during the
Partitions of Poland
. It varied among countries. In
Congress Poland
, a sołtys was an executive branch of a
gromada
. He was supposed to guard order in the city. In Congress Poland, a gmina was made up of a few gromadas. In the
Grand Duchy of Posen
a sołtys usually served the role of a village owner.
[3]
In 1934, sołectwa were introduced once again to Poland, which mainly held control over business relating to the people.
[3]
In the
Polish People's Republic
, the role of a sołtys was replaced from 1954 to 1958 with a different position, though it was quickly changed to sołtys.
[4]
A sołtys was the executive of a village government which, until 1973, ruled a gromada. From 1973 a sołtys governed a sołectwo.

1246 Chaka
, provisional designation
1932 OA
, is a background
asteroid
from the central regions of the
asteroid belt
, approximately 18 kilometers (11 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 23 July 1932, by South African astronomer
Cyril Jackson
at the
Union Observatory
in Johannesburg.
[1]
The uncommon
A
/Sl-type asteroid has a longer than average
rotation period
of 25.5 hours.
[13]
It was named for the Zulu King
Shaka
.
[2]
Orbit and classification
[
edit
]
Chaka
is a non-
family
asteroid from the main belt's
background population
.
[4]
[5]
It orbits the Sun in the
central
asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8-3.4
AU
once every 4 years and 3 months (1,549 days;
semi-major axis
of 2.62 AU). Its orbit has an
eccentricity
of 0.31 and an
inclination
of 16
°
with respect to the
ecliptic
.
[3]
The body's
observation arc
begins with its first observation at Johannesburg on 4 July 1932, three weeks prior to its official discovery observation.
[1]
Naming
[
edit
]
This
minor planet
was named after
Shaka
(c.1787-1828), also Chaka or Tchaka, founder and one of the most influential monarchs of the
Zulu Kingdom
. The official
naming citation
was mentioned in
The Names of the Minor Planets
by
Paul Herget
in 1955 (
H 115
).
[2]
Physical characteristics
[
edit
]
Chaka
's
spectral type
has been determined during the
Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey
(S3OS2). In the Tholen-like taxonomic variant of the survey, the asteroid is a rare
A-type
, while in the SMASS-like variant it is a Sl-subtype, that transitions between the common
S-
and uncommon
L-type asteroids
.
[4]
[12]
Rotation period
[
edit
]
In October 2013, a rotational
lightcurve
of
Chaka
was obtained from
photometric
observations by Joe Garlitz at his Elgin Observatory. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined
rotation period
of
25.462
±
0.001
hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.18
magnitude
(
U=3
).
[a]
Other period determinations were made by European astronomers (20 h; Δ0.2) at
OHP
and
La Silla
in October 1996 (
U=2
),
[14]
and by Andrea Ferrero (25.44 h; Δ0.25) at the Italian Bigmuskie Observatory (
B88
) in November 2013 (
U=2
).
[15]
Diameter and albedo
[
edit
]
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite
IRAS
and the
NEOWISE
mission of NASA's
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
,
Chaka
measures between 17.63 and 20.84 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an
albedo
between 0.195 and 0.310.
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
The
Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link
adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.2351 and a diameter of 18.11 kilometers based on an
absolute magnitude
of 10.9.

Jacqueline Ilyse Stone
(born June 30, 1949) is an emeritus professor of Japanese religion in the department of religion at
Princeton University
and a specialist in Japanese Buddhism, particularly
Kamakura
Buddhism,
Nichiren Buddhism
from medieval to modern times, and deathbed practices in Japan.  Stone has been elected to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences
.
[1]
Biography
[
edit
]
Stone earned a B.A. in Japanese and English from
San Francisco State University
in 1974. She then received an M.A. (1986) and a Ph.D. (1990) from
UCLA
, where she studied under
William LaFleur
and wrote a dissertation on problematic texts attributed to
Nichiren
.
[2]
She taught at Princeton from 1990 until her retirement on July 1, 2019.
[3]
Academic career
[
edit
]
Stone has written and edited widely in English and Japanese on topics including the
Lotus Sutra
, medieval and modern movements in Nichiren Buddhism, historiography, death, and ideas of time and space in Japanese religions.
[4]
As a teacher at Princeton University,  Stone received the Graduate Mentoring Award in the Humanities (jointly with
Stephen F. Teiser
) in 2014 and the President's Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2018.
[3]
She has trained more than a dozen PhD students, many of whom now  at leading Buddhist and Religious Studies programs in North America.
[5]
Stone has served as president of the Society for the Study of Japanese Religions and co-chair of the Buddhism section of the American Academy of Religion. She is vice president and chief financial officer of the editorial board of the Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism. She is also a member of the advisory board of the
Japanese Journal of Religious Studies
.
[3]
In 2018 she was elected to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences
.
[1]
Academic work
[
edit
]
Stone's first monograph,
Original Enlightenment and the Transformation of Medieval Japanese Buddhism
(University of Hawai’i Press, 1999), received the 2001
American Academy of Religion
Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion in the Historical Studies category.
[6]
It is a  study of
hongaku
thought, the notion that all beings are “originally enlightened” and simply need to realize their own Buddha nature.
[7]
Rather than seeing the new Kamakura schools as reacting against a moribund
Tendai
establishment as much previous scholarship had done, the book offers an interactive model that showing that both Tendai and Nichiren movements simultaneously and creatively worked through the problems and promise of original enlightenment or
hongaku
discourse. While original enlightenment thought is often seen as denying the need for practice, Stone demonstrates that medieval authors promoted a variety of practices.
[6]
: 190-235
Practice was not ignored; it was instead reconceptualized, often as an expression rather than a cause of awakening.
[8]
The book introduces a  four-part paradigm for enlightenment in medieval Japan based on notions of non-linearity (liberation occurs in a moment), single condition (one practice leads to liberation), all-inclusiveness (the practice contains all of enlightenment within it), and a denial of the need to make merit or remove sin.
[6]
: 228-235
Her second monograph,
Right Thoughts at the Last Moment: Buddhism and Deathbed Practices in Early Medieval Japan
(University of Hawai’i Press, 2016), won the 2017 Toshihide Numata Book Award in Buddhism.
[9]
This book  documents a common religious culture centered on deathbed practices that often transcend social and sectarian distinctions.
[10]
The book overcomes divisions in Buddhist Studies between social history and doctrinal research by showing how teachings and practice relate to one another. Stone uncovers competing logics that help define deathbed ritual including notions of karmic causality and individual responsibility, highly social discourses of merit transfer, and the idea that the deathbed moment is so powerful that it can override a lifetime of wrongdoings. It uses a range of sources including ritual manuals, Buddhist narratives, and hagiographies, many discussed in English for the first time.

Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator
(
Koinē Greek
:
Κλεοπάτρα Θεά Φιλοπάτωρ
,
[a]
lit. Cleopatra "father-loving goddess";
[note 5]
70/69 BC - 10 August 30 BC) was Queen of the
Ptolemaic Kingdom
of
Egypt
from 51 to 30 BC, and its last active ruler.
[note 6]
A member of the
Ptolemaic dynasty
, she was a descendant of its founder
Ptolemy I Soter
, a
Macedonian Greek
general and
companion
of
Alexander the Great
.
[note 7]
After the
death of Cleopatra
, Egypt became
a province
of the
Roman Empire
, marking the end of the last
Hellenistic-period
state in the
Mediterranean
and of the age that had lasted since the
reign of Alexander
(336-323 BC).
[note 8]
Her first language was
Koine Greek
and she is the only known Ptolemaic ruler to learn the
Egyptian language
.
[note 9]
In 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father,
Ptolemy XII Auletes
, during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a
Roman client state
) allowed his rival daughter
Berenice IV
to claim his throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint
reign of Cleopatra
and her brother
Ptolemy XIII
began, but a falling-out between them led to open
civil war
. After losing the 48 BC
Battle of Pharsalus
in
Greece
against his rival
Julius Caesar
(a
Roman dictator
and
consul
) in
Caesar's civil war
, the
Roman
statesman
Pompey
fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII, at the urging of his court
eunuchs
, had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied
Alexandria
. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser,
Potheinos
, viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so
his forces
besieged her and Caesar at the palace
. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy XIII died in the
Battle of the Nile
; Cleopatra's half-sister
Arsinoe IV
was eventually exiled to
Ephesus
for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother
Ptolemy XIV
joint rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son,
Caesarion
. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's
villa
. After
Caesar's assassination
, followed shortly afterwards by that of Ptolemy XIV (on Cleopatra's orders), she named Caesarion co-ruler as
Ptolemy XV
.
In the
Liberators' civil war
of 43-42 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman
Second Triumvirate
formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir
Octavian
,
Mark Antony
, and
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus
. After their meeting at
Tarsos
in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during
his invasions
of the
Parthian Empire
and the
Kingdom of Armenia
. The
Donations of Alexandria
declared their children rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister
Octavia Minor
led to the
final war
of the
Roman Republic
. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the
Roman Senate
to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC
Battle of Actium
,
Octavian's forces
invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his
Roman triumphal
procession, she killed herself by poisoning, contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an
asp
.
Cleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern
works of art
.
Roman historiography
and
Latin poetry
produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later
Medieval
and
Renaissance literature
. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include
Roman busts
,
paintings
, and
sculptures
,
cameo carvings
and
glass
,
Ptolemaic
and
Roman coinage
, and
reliefs
. In
Renaissance
and
Baroque art
, she was the subject of many works including operas, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a
pop culture icon
of
Egyptomania
since the
Victorian era
, and in modern times, Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts,
burlesque
satire, Hollywood films, and brand images for commercial products.
Etymology
The Latinized form
Cleopatra
comes from the
Ancient Greek
Kleopátra
(
Κλεοπάτρα
), meaning "glory of her father",
[7]
from
κλέος
(
kléos
, "glory") and
πατήρ
(
patḗr
, "father").
[8]
The masculine form would have been written either as
Kleópatros
(
Κλεόπατρος
) or
Pátroklos
(
Πάτροκλος
).
[8]
Cleopatra was
the name
of
Alexander the Great's sister
, as well as
Cleopatra Alcyone
, wife of
Meleager
in
Greek mythology
.
[9]
Through the marriage of
Ptolemy V Epiphanes
and
Cleopatra I Syra
(a
Seleucid princess
), the name entered the
Ptolemaic dynasty
.
[10]
[11]
Cleopatra's adopted title
Theā́ Philopátōra
(
Θεᾱ́ Φιλοπάτωρα
) means "goddess who loves her father".

Biography
Background
Hellenistic
portrait of
Ptolemy XII Auletes
, the father of Cleopatra, in the
Louvre
, Paris
[14]
Ptolemaic
pharaohs
were
crowned
by the Egyptian
high priest of Ptah
at
Memphis
, but resided in the multicultural and largely
Greek
city of
Alexandria
, established by
Alexander the Great
of
Macedon
.
[15]
[16]
[17]
[note 11]
They
spoke Greek
and governed Egypt as
Hellenistic
Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the
native Egyptian language
.
[18]
[19]
[20]
[note 9]
In contrast, Cleopatra could speak
multiple languages
by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language.
[21]
[22]
[20]
[note 12]
Plutarch implies that she also spoke
Ethiopian
, the language of the "
Troglodytes
",
Hebrew
(or
Aramaic
),
Arabic
, the
Syrian language
(perhaps
Syriac
),
Median
, and
Parthian
, and she could apparently also speak
Latin
, although her
Roman
contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native
Koine Greek
.
[22]
[20]
[23]
[note 13]
Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, these languages reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore
North African
and
West Asian
territories that once belonged to the
Ptolemaic Kingdom
.
[24]
Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the
reign of Cleopatra
.
[25]
[26]
[27]
When
Ptolemy IX Lathyros
died in late 81 BC, he was succeeded by his daughter
Berenice III
.
[28]
[29]
With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch, Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson
Ptolemy XI Alexander II
, an arrangement made by the Roman dictator
Sulla
.
[28]
[29]
Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC, and was
lynched
soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination.
[28]
[30]
[31]
Ptolemy XI, and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father
Ptolemy X Alexander I
, willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as
collateral for loans
, so that the Romans had legal grounds to take over Egypt, their
client state
, after the assassination of Ptolemy XI.
[28]
[32]
[33]
The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the
illegitimate
sons of Ptolemy IX, bestowing
Cyprus
on
Ptolemy of Cyprus
and
Egypt
on
Ptolemy XII Auletes
.
[28]
[30]
Early childhood
Main article:
Early life of Cleopatra
Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling
Ptolemaic pharaoh
Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother,
[34]
[35]
[note 14]
presumably Ptolemy XII's wife
Cleopatra V Tryphaena
(who may have been the same person as
Cleopatra VI Tryphaena
),
[36]
[37]
[38]
[note 15]
[note 3]
the mother of Cleopatra's older sister,
Berenice IV Epiphaneia
.
[39]
[40]
[41]
[note 16]
Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.
[42]
[43]
The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister
Arsinoe IV
and brothers
Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator
and
Ptolemy XIV
,
[39]
[40]
[41]
were born in the absence of his wife.
[44]
[45]
Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the
Greek arts
of oration and
philosophy
.
[46]
During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the
Musaeum
, including the
Library of Alexandria
.

Reign and exile of Ptolemy XII
Main article:
Early life of Cleopatra
Further information:
First Triumvirate
Most likely a posthumously painted portrait of Cleopatra with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal
diadem
and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman
Herculaneum
, Italy, 1st century AD
[49]
[50]
[note 17]
In 65 BC the
Roman censor
Marcus Licinius Crassus
argued before the
Roman Senate
that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his
proposed bill
and the similar bill of
tribune
Servilius Rullus
in 63 BC were rejected.
[51]
[52]
Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering
remuneration
and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as
Pompey
during
his campaign
against
Mithridates VI of Pontus
, and eventually
Julius Caesar
after he became
Roman consul
in 59 BC.
[53]
[54]
[55]
[note 18]
However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the
Roman banker
Gaius Rabirius Postumus
.
[56]
[57]
[58]
In 58 BC the Romans
annexed Cyprus
and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus, Ptolemy XII's brother, to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to
Paphos
.
[59]
[60]
[58]
[note 19]
Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother, a decision which, along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans, damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies.
[59]
[61]
[62]
Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force, traveling first to
Rhodes
, then
Athens
, and finally the
villa
of
triumvir
Pompey in the
Alban Hills
, near
Praeneste
, Italy.
[59]
[60]
[63]
[note 20]
Ptolemy XII spent nearly a year there on the outskirts of Rome, ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra, then about 11.
[59]
[63]
[note 21]
Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father Ptolemy XII. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy, an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters.
[64]
[57]
[65]
[note 22]
When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt, he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the
Temple of Artemis
in
Ephesus
.
[66]
[67]
[68]
The Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power.
[69]
Pompey persuaded
Aulus Gabinius
, the
Roman governor of Syria
, to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII, offering him 10,000
talents
for the proposed mission.
[69]
[70]
[71]
Although it put him at odds with
Roman law
, Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of
Hasmonean Judea
, where
Hyrcanus II
had
Antipater the Idumaean
, father of
Herod the Great
, furnish the Roman-led army with supplies.
[69]
[72]
As a young cavalry officer,
Mark Antony
was under Gabinius's command.
[73]
He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of
Pelousion
, and for rescuing the body of
Archelaos
, the husband of Berenice IV, after he was killed in battle, ensuring him a proper royal burial.
[74]
[75]
Cleopatra, then 14 years of age, would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later, Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.
[74]
[76]
The
Roman Republic
(green) and
Ptolemaic Egypt
(yellow) in 40 BC
Gabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority, for which he was acquitted, but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile, from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 BC by Caesar.
[77]
[78]
Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt, but he was killed by the
Parthians
at the
Battle of Carrhae
in 53 BC.
[77]
[79]
Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties.
[80]
[81]
[82]
He allowed Gabinius's largely
Germanic
and
Gallic
Roman garrison, the
Gabiniani
, to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.
[80]
[83]
[84]
[note 23]
Within a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources.
[85]
[86]
[82]
[note 24]
Despite these problems, Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs, oversaw major construction projects such as the
Temple of Edfu
and a temple at
Dendera
, and stabilized the economy.
[87]
[86]
[88]
[note 25]
On 31 May 52 BC, Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII, as indicated by an inscription in the
Temple of Hathor
at Dendera.
[89]
[90]
[91]
[note 26]
Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XII's debt by the time of the latter's death, and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.

Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to
Hermonthis
, near
Thebes
, to install a new sacred
Buchis
bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god
Montu
in the
Ancient Egyptian religion
.
[92]
[93]
[94]
[note 27]
Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual
flooding of the Nile
, and lawless behavior instigated by the
Gabiniani
, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by
Gabinius
to garrison Egypt.
[95]
[96]
Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the
Roman Republic
17.5 million
drachmas
.
[97]
In 50 BC
Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus
,
proconsul
of Syria, sent his two eldest sons to Egypt, most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria
against the Parthians
.
[98]
The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court.
[98]
[99]
Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment, but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication, which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate.
[100]
[99]
Bibulus, siding with Pompey in
Caesar's Civil War
, failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece, which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.
[100]
By 29 August 51 BC, official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler, evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a co-ruler.
[97]
[99]
[101]
She had probably married him,
[79]
but there is no record of this.
[92]
The Ptolemaic practice of
sibling marriage
was introduced by
Ptolemy II
and his sister
Arsinoe II
.
[102]
[103]
[104]
A
long-held royal Egyptian practice
, it was loathed by contemporary
Greeks
.
[102]
[103]
[104]
[note 28]
By the reign of Cleopatra, however, it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.
[102]
[103]
[104]
Despite Cleopatra's rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies, notably the eunuch
Potheinos
, his childhood tutor, regent, and administrator of his properties.
[105]
[96]
[106]
Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included
Achillas
, a prominent military commander, and
Theodotus of Chios
, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII.
[105]
[107]
Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister, followed by the establishment of his first
regnal date
in 49 BC.

Assassination of Pompey
Main article:
Reign of Cleopatra
A Roman portrait of
Pompey

Augustus
(27 BC - 14 AD), a copy of an original from 70 to 60 BC, and located in the
Venice National Archaeological Museum
, Italy
In the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and
her forces
were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son
Gnaeus Pompeius
arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father.
[108]
After returning to Italy from
the wars in Gaul
and
crossing the Rubicon
in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to
flee to Greece
.
[110]
[111]
In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome.
[110]
[112]
Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes.
[113]
[114]
[115]
By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to
Roman Syria
with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt.
[116]
[109]
[117]
She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern
Nile Delta
.
[118]
[109]
[119]
In Greece, Caesar and Pompey's forces engaged each other at the decisive
Battle of Pharsalus
on 9
August 48 BC, leading to the destruction of most of Pompey's army and his forced flight to
Tyre, Lebanon
.
[118]
[120]
[121]
[note 30]
Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies, Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge, where he could replenish his forces.
[122]
[121]
[119]
[note 31]
Ptolemy XIII's advisers, however, feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war.
[122]
[123]
[124]
In a scheme devised by Theodotus, Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message, only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC.
[122]
[120]
[125]
[note 32]
Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey's head, severed and
embalmed
, sent to Caesar, who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace.
[126]
[127]
[128]
[note 32]
Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.

[130]
Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival.
[131]
[132]
Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally.
[131]
[133]
[132]
Historian
Cassius Dio
records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit.
[131]
[134]
[135]
Plutarch
provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.
[131]
[136]
[137]
[note 34]
When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar, he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot, but he was arrested by Caesar, who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd.
[138]
[139]
[140]
Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the
assembly of Alexandria
, where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII—previously possessed by Pompey—naming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs.
[141]
[139]
[133]
[note 35]
Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings, Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV, to rule together over Cyprus, thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.
[142]
[139]
[143]
[note 35]
Judging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter's army of 20,000, including the Gabiniani, could most likely defeat Caesar's army of 4,000 unsupported troops, Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra.
[142]
[139]
[144]
[note 36]
After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos, Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen, but soon afterward had her tutor
Ganymedes
kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army.
[145]
[146]
[147]
[note 37]
Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator, only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV.
[145]
[148]
[149]
The resulting
siege of the palace
, with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside, lasted into the following year of 47 BC.
[150]
[129]
[151]
[note 38]
Sometime between January and March of 47 BC, Caesar's reinforcements arrived, including those led by
Mithridates of Pergamon
and Antipater the Idumaean.
[145]
[129]
[152]
[note 39]
Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the
Nile
,
where Caesar attacked them
. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat, but it capsized, and he drowned.
[153]
[129]
[154]
[note 40]
Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia, by
Marcus Junius Brutus
, and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar's
triumph in Rome
before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.
[155]
[156]
[157]
Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace, most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesar's child since September 48 BC.
[158]
[159]
[160]
Caesar's term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC.
[155]
However, Antony, an officer of his, helped to secure Caesar's appointment as
dictator
lasting for a year, until October 47 BC, providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt.
[155]
Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatra's sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler, Caesar appointed Cleopatra's 12-year-old brother, Ptolemy XIV, as joint ruler with the 22-year-old Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage, but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar.
[161]
[129]
[152]
[note 41]
The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known, although she had a governor there by 42 BC.
[162]
[152]
Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of
Egyptian monuments
,
[129]
[163]
[164]
although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historical event.
[165]
The historian
Suetonius
provided considerable details about the voyage, including use of
Thalamegos
, the
pleasure barge
constructed by
Ptolemy IV
, which during his reign measured 90 metres (300 ft) in length and 24 metres (80 ft) in height and was complete with dining rooms, state rooms, holy shrines, and
promenades
along its two decks, resembling a floating villa.
[165]
[166]
Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography; he was well-read in the works of
Eratosthenes
and
Pytheas
, and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river, but turned back before reaching
Ethiopia
.
[167]
[168]
Caesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC, allegedly to confront
Pharnaces II of Pontus
, the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia.
[169]
It is possible that Caesar, married to the prominent Roman woman
Calpurnia
, also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son.
[169]
[163]
He left three legions in Egypt, later increased to four, under the command of the
freedman
Rufio
, to secure Cleopatra's tenuous position, but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.
[169]
[170]
[171]
Caesarion
, Cleopatra's alleged child with Caesar, was born 23 June 47 BC and was originally named "Pharaoh Caesar", as preserved on a
stele
at the
Serapeum of Saqqara
.
[172]
[129]
[173]
[note 42]
Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia, Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion (but perhaps accepted his parentage in private).
[174]
[note 43]
Cleopatra, on the other hand, made repeated official declarations about Caesarion's parentage, naming Caesar as the father.
[174]
[175]
[176]
Cleopatra and her nominal joint ruler Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC, presumably without Caesarion, and were given lodging in Caesar's villa within the
Horti Caesaris
.
[177]
[173]
[178]
[note 44]
As with their father Ptolemy XII, Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of "friend and ally of the Roman people" (
Latin
:
socius et amicus populi Romani
), in effect client rulers loyal to Rome.
[179]
[180]
[181]
Cleopatra's visitors at Caesar's villa across the
Tiber
included the senator
Cicero
, who found her arrogant.
[182]
[183]
Sosigenes of Alexandria
, one of the members of Cleopatra's court, aided Caesar in the calculations for the new
Julian calendar
, put into effect 1
January 45 BC.
[184]
[185]
[186]
The
Temple of Venus Genetrix
, established in the
Forum of Caesar
on 25 September 46 BC, contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which stood there at least until the 3rd century AD), associating the mother of Caesar's child directly with the goddess
Venus
, mother of the Romans.
[187]
[185]
[188]
The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess
Isis
with the
Roman religion
.
[182]
Cleopatra's presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the
Lupercalia
festival a month before Caesar's assassination.
[189]
[190]
Antony attempted to place a royal
diadem
on Caesar's head, but the latter refused in what was most likely a staged performance, perhaps to gauge the Roman public's mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship.
[189]
[190]
Cicero, who was present at the festival, mockingly asked where the diadem came from, an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred.
[189]
[190]
Caesar was assassinated
on the
Ides of March
(15 March 44 BC), but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April, in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar's heir.
[191]
[192]
[193]
However, Caesar's will named his grandnephew
Octavian
as the primary heir, and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt.
[191]
[192]
[194]
A few months later, Cleopatra had Ptolemy XIV killed by poisoning, elevating her son Caesarion as her co-ruler.

Cleopatra's Gate
in Tarsos (now
Tarsus, Mersin
, Turkey), the site where she met
Mark Antony
in 41 BC
[197]
Octavian, Antony, and
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus
formed the
Second Triumvirate
in 43 BC, in which they were each
elected
for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and
bring Caesar's assassins to justice
.
[198]
[199]
Cleopatra received messages from both
Gaius Cassius Longinus
, one of Caesar's assassins, and
Publius Cornelius Dolabella
, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid.
[198]
She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella.
[198]
[200]
These troops were captured by Cassius in
Palestine
.
[198]
[200]
While
Serapion
, Cleopatra's governor of Cyprus, defected to Cassius and provided him with ships, Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting.
[198]
[201]
By the autumn of 42 BC, Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins at the
Battle of Philippi
in Greece, leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.
[198]
[202]
By the end of 42 BC, Octavian had gained control over much of
the western half
of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half, with Lepidus largely marginalized.
[203]
In the summer of 41 BC, Antony established his headquarters at
Tarsos
in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters, which she rebuffed until Antony's envoy
Quintus Dellius
convinced her to come.
[204]
[205]
The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the
Levant
, but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal, romantic relationship with the queen.
[206]
[205]
Cleopatra sailed up the
Kydnos River
to Tarsos in
Thalamegos
, hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship.
[207]
[208]
[note 46]
Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius, arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria, and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister, Arsinoe IV, executed at Ephesus.
[209]
[210]
Cleopatra's former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.
[209]
[211]
Relationship with Mark Antony
Main article:
Reign of Cleopatra

Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC.
[209]
[212]
Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done.
[213]
[214]
In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos.
[215]
[211]
He also had his subordinates, such as
Publius Ventidius Bassus
,
drive the Parthians out
of Anatolia and Syria.
[214]
[216]
[217]
[note 47]
Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise.
[218]
With his powers as a triumvir, Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands, which were currently in Roman hands, to Cleopatra.
[219]
[220]
While it is clear that both
Cilicia
and Cyprus were under Cleopatra's control by 19 November 38 BC, the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41-40 BC, during her time spent with Antony.
[219]
By the spring of 40 BC, Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria, where his governor
Lucius Decidius Saxa
was killed and his army taken by
Quintus Labienus
, a former officer under Cassius who now served the
Parthian Empire
.
[221]
Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories.
[221]
She would not see Antony again until 37 BC, but she maintained correspondence, and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp.
[221]
By the end of 40 BC, Cleopatra had given birth to twins, a boy named
Alexander Helios
and a girl named
Cleopatra Selene II
, both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children.
[222]
[223]
Helios
(the Sun) and
Selene
(the Moon) were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation,
[224]
as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the
exploits of Alexander the Great
by conquering the
Parthians
.
[214]
The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra
(1885), by
Lawrence Alma-Tadema
Mark Antony's Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the
Perusine War
(41-40 BC), initiated by his ambitious wife
Fulvia
against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome.
[224]
[225]
It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra, but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra's meeting with Antony at Tarsos.
[226]
Fulvia and Antony's brother
Lucius Antonius
were eventually besieged by Octavian at
Perusia
(modern
Perugia
, Italy) and then exiled from Italy, after which Fulvia died at
Sicyon
in Greece while attempting to reach Antony.
[227]
Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at
Brundisium
in Italy in September 40 BC.
[227]
[214]
Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony's control of the Roman Republic's territories east of the
Ionian Sea
, it also stipulated that he concede
Italia
,
Hispania
, and
Gaul
, and marry Octavian's sister
Octavia the Younger
, a potential rival for Cleopatra.
[228]
[229]
In December 40 BC Cleopatra received
Herod
in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in
Judea
.
[230]
Herod had been installed as a
tetrarch
there by Antony, but he was soon at odds with
Antigonus II Mattathias
of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty.
[230]
The latter had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch
Phasael
, who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra's court.
[230]
Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declined and traveled to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him
king of Judea
.
[231]
[232]
This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new
Herodian kingdom
.

Relations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia, but also sired her two children,
Antonia the Elder
in 39 BC and
Antonia Minor
in 36 BC, and moved his headquarters to Athens.
[236]
However, Cleopatra's position in Egypt was secure.
[214]
Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance, but received none from Cleopatra.
[236]
Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1
January 37 BC, Octavia arranged for a meeting at
Tarentum
, where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC.
[237]
With two
legions
granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia, Antony traveled to
Antioch
, where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.
[238]
Antony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues, such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign.
[238]
[239]
Cleopatra brought her now three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatra's ambitious plans for the future.
[240]
[241]
In order to stabilize the east, Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra's domain,
[239]
he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him, yet would ultimately outlast him.
[242]
[220]
[note 49]
In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant, including nearly all of
Phoenicia
(
Lebanon
) minus
Tyre
and
Sidon
, which remained in Roman hands.
[243]
[220]
[239]
She also received
Ptolemais Akko
(modern
Acre, Israel
), a city that was established by Ptolemy II.
[243]
Given her
ancestral relations with the Seleucids
, she was granted the region of
Coele-Syria
along the upper
Orontes River
.
[244]
[239]
She was even given the region surrounding
Jericho
in Palestine, but she leased this territory back to Herod.
[245]
[232]
At the expense of the
Nabataean king
Malichus I
(a cousin of Herod), Cleopatra was also given a portion of the
Nabataean Kingdom
around the
Gulf of Aqaba
on the
Red Sea
, including Ailana (modern
Aqaba
, Jordan).
[246]
[232]
To the west Cleopatra was handed
Cyrene
along the Libyan coast, as well as
Itanos
and
Olous
in
Roman Crete
.
[247]
[239]
Although still administered by Roman officials, these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating
her coinage
in 36 BC.
[248]

(right), issued in 41 BC to celebrate the establishment of the
Second Triumvirate
by Octavian, Antony and
Marcus Aemilius Lepidus
in 43 BC
Antony's enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian, who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic.
[250]
Octavian, fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia, granted both her and
Livia
, his own wife, extraordinary privileges of
sacrosanctity
.
[250]
Some 50 years before,
Cornelia Africana
, daughter of
Scipio Africanus
, had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her.
[248]
She was now followed by Octavia and Livia, whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra's, erected by Caesar.
[248]
In 36 BC, Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the
Euphrates
in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire.
[251]
She then returned to Egypt, perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy.
[252]
By the summer of 36 BC, she had given birth to
Ptolemy Philadelphus
, her second son with Antony.
[252]
[239]
Antony's Parthian campaign
in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons, in particular the betrayal of
Artavasdes II of Armenia
, who defected to the Parthian side.
[253]
[220]
[254]
After losing some 30,000 men, more than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge), Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near
Berytus
(modern
Beirut
, Lebanon) in December, engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops.
[253]
[255]
Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome, and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.
[253]
Donations of Alexandria

Antony
in 34 BC with his portrait on the
obverse
, which bears the inscription reading "ANTONIVS ARMENIA DEVICTA", alluding to his Armenian campaign. The reverse features Cleopatra, with the inscription "CLEOPATR[AE] REGINAE REGVM FILIORVM REGVM". The mention of her children on the reverse refers to the Donations of Alexandria.
[256]
[257]
As Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally
Armenia
, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses.
[258]
[259]
[note 50]
Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria.
[258]
[259]
When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household.
[260]
[220]
Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including
Sextus Pompeius
and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.
[260]
[220]
[255]
Dellius was sent as Antony's envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential
marriage alliance
that would wed the Armenian king's daughter to Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra.
[261]
[262]
When this was declined, Antony marched his army into Armenia, defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family.
[261]
[263]
Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph, dressed as
Dionysus
and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra, who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais.
[261]
[264]
News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.

) added in Greek, likely by the queen's own hand
[265]
[266]
[267]
In an event held at the
gymnasium
soon after the triumph, Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the
Queen of Kings
with her son Caesarion,
King of Kings
, while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia,
Media
, and Parthia, and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphos was declared king of Syria and Cilicia.
[268]
[269]
[270]
Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene.
[271]
[272]
Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony.
[271]
[270]
[note 51]
Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims, now known as the
Donations of Alexandria
. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes, but the two consuls, both supporters of Antony, had it censored from public view.
[273]
[272]
In late 34 BC, Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years.
[274]
[272]
[176]
[note 52]
Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy, while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia, marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia, and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian.
[274]
[272]
The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from
Augustan-period literature
through to various media in modern times.
[275]
[276]
Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with
witchcraft and sorcery
and was as dangerous as
Homer
's
Helen of Troy
in destroying civilization.
[277]
Pliny the Elder
claims in his
Natural History
that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinner-party bet.
[278]
[279]
The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the
Library of Pergamum
to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by
Gaius Calvisius Sabinus
.
[280]

, contains the signature of Cleopatra, probably written by an official authorized to sign for her.

[266]
It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or
Publius Canidius Crassus

this is likely the autograph of the queen, as it was Ptolemaic practice to
countersign
documents to avoid forgery.

Battle of Actium
Main articles:
Battle of Actium
and
Reign of Cleopatra
A reconstructed statue of
Augustus
as a younger Octavian, dated
c.
30 BC
In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1
January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen.
[282]
Before Antony and Octavian's joint
imperium
expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian.
[282]
In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists
Gaius Sosius
and
Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus
became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him.
[281]
[283]
During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls.
[281]
[284]
Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.
[281]
[284]
[285]
Antony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC, where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire.
[281]
Ahenobarbus, wary of having Octavian's propaganda confirmed to the public, attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian.
[286]
[287]
Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch.
[286]
[287]
Cleopatra refused Antony's requests that she return to Egypt, judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt.
[286]
[287]
Cleopatra's insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans, such as Ahenobarbus and
Lucius Munatius Plancus
.
[286]
[284]
During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens, where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce.
[286]
[284]
[270]
This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony's will, invested with the
Vestal Virgins
.
[286]
[284]
[272]
Although a violation of sacred and legal rights, Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the
Temple of Vesta
, and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra.
[286]
[272]
Octavian highlighted parts of the will, such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar, that the Donations of Alexandria were legal, that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome, and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic.
[288]
[284]
[272]
In a show of loyalty to Rome, Octavian decided to begin construction of
his own mausoleum
at the
Campus Martius
.
[284]
Octavian's legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC.
[284]
With Antony's will made public, Octavian had his
casus belli
, and Rome declared war on Cleopatra,
[288]
[289]
[290]
not Antony.
[note 55]
The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra's territorial acquisitions, with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony, and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony's triumviral authority had expired.
[291]

Antony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian, but the crews of Antony and Cleopatra's navy were not all well-trained, some of them perhaps from merchant vessels, whereas Octavian had a fully professional force.
[292]
[287]
Antony wanted to cross the
Adriatic Sea
and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium,
[293]
but Cleopatra, concerned primarily with defending Egypt, overrode the decision to attack Italy directly.
[294]
[287]
Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at
Patrai
in Greece, and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium, on the southern side of the
Ambracian Gulf
.
[294]
[293]
Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings, but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod, and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign.
[295]
They also lost the support of Malichus I, which would prove to have strategic consequences.
[296]
Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC, while defections to Octavian's camp continued, including Antony's long-time companion Dellius
[296]
and the allied kings
Amyntas of Galatia
and
Deiotaros of Paphlagonia
.
[296]
While some in Antony's camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland, Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation, to keep Octavian's fleet away from Egypt.
[297]
On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian, led by
Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa
, met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the
Battle of Actium
.
[297]
[293]
[289]
Cleopatra, aboard her flagship, the
Antonias
, commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the rear of the fleet, in what was likely a move by Antony's officers to marginalize her during the battle.
[297]
Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy, which Cleopatra, ever concerned about defending Egypt, used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the
Peloponnese
.
[298]
[299]
[300]
Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony, but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible.
[300]
Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship, identified by its
distinctive purple
sails, as the two escaped the battle and headed for
Tainaron
.
[298]
Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage, until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her.
[301]
The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3
September, and was followed by massive defections of officers, troops, and allied kings to Octavian's side.

and consuming poison in an act of suicide, while her son
Caesarion
, also wearing a royal diadem, stands behind her.
[303]
[304]
While Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at
Paraitonion
in Egypt.
[301]
[305]
The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory.
[301]
She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion.
[306]
It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival,
Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene
, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.
[307]
[308]
Lucius Pinarius
, Mark Antony's appointed governor of Cyrene, received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony's messengers could arrive at his court.
[307]
Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavian's side, surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain.
[307]
Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers.
[307]
In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of
Pharos
that he nicknamed the
Timoneion
, after the philosopher
Timon of Athens
, who was famous for his cynicism and
misanthropy
.
[307]
Herod, who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra, traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony.
[309]
Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty, so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea, further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.
[309]
Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC, when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion.
[310]
Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him, take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea, and then set sail to a foreign port, perhaps in
India
, where she could spend time recuperating.
[310]
[308]
However, these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I, as advised by Octavian's governor of Syria,
Quintus Didius
, managed to burn Cleopatra's fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated.
[310]
[308]
Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian.
[310]
Although most likely later pro-Octavian propaganda, it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.
[311]
The Death of Cleopatra
(1658), by
Guido Cagnacci
Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the
ephebi
, which, along with reliefs on a stele from
Koptos
dated 21 September 31 BC, demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt.
[312]
In a show of solidarity, Antony also had
Marcus Antonius Antyllus
, his son with Fulvia, enter the
ephebi
at the same time.
[310]
Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian, still stationed at Rhodes, although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra.
[311]
Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt, offered Octavian money in the future, and immediately sent him lavish gifts.
[311]
[308]
Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction.
[313]
Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared, but when Antony suspected foul intent, he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.
[314]
After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results, Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC,
[315]
stopping at
Ptolemais in Phoenicia
, where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies.
[316]
Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion, while
Cornelius Gallus
, marching eastward from Cyrene, defeated Antony's forces near Paraitonion.
[317]
[318]
Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria, but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian's tired troops outside the city's
hippodrome
.
[317]
[318]
However, on 1 August 30 BC, Antony's naval fleet surrendered to Octavian, followed by Antony's cavalry.
[317]
[299]
[319]
Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide.
[317]
[320]
[321]
In despair, Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 53.
[317]
[299]
[308]
According to Plutarch, he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb, telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavian's companion
Gaius Proculeius
over anyone else in his entourage.
[317]
[322]
[323]
It was Proculeius, however, who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen, denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures.
[324]
[325]
Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.
[324]
[308]
The Death of Cleopatra
(1796-1797), by
Jean-Baptiste Regnault
Octavian entered Alexandria, occupied the palace, and seized Cleopatra's three youngest children.
[324]
[326]
When she met with Octavian, Cleopatra told him bluntly, "I will not be led in a triumph" (
Ancient Greek
:
οὑ θριαμβεύσομαι
,
romanized
:
ou thriambéusomai
), according to
Livy
, a rare recording of her exact words.
[327]
[328]
Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom.
[329]
When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days, she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV.
[329]
[299]
[308]
It is unclear if
Cleopatra's suicide
on 10 August 30 BC, at age 39, took place within the palace or her tomb.
[330]
[331]
[note 4]
It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and
Charmion
, who also took their own lives.
[329]
[332]
Octavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in
her tomb
.
[329]
[333]
[334]
Cleopatra's physician Olympos did not explain her cause of death, although the popular belief is that she allowed an
asp
or
Egyptian cobra
to bite and poison her.
[335]
[336]
[308]
Plutarch relates this tale, but then suggests an implement (
κνῆστις
,
knêstis
,
lit.
'spine, cheese-grater') was used to introduce the toxin by scratching, while Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (
βελόνη
,
belónē
), and
Strabo
argued for an ointment of some kind.
[337]
[336]
[338]
[note 56]
No venomous snake was found with her body, but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.
[335]
[338]
[334]
Cleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt, perhaps with plans to flee to
Kushite
Nubia
, Ethiopia, or India.
[339]
[340]
[318]
Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC, after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king.
[341]
[342]
[343]
[note 2]
Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher
Arius Didymus
that there was room for only one Caesar in the world.
[344]
[note 57]
With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the
Roman province
of
Egypt
was established,
[345]
[299]
[346]
[note 58]
marking the end of the Hellenistic period.
[347]
[348]
[note 8]
In January of 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus ("the revered") and
amassed constitutional powers
that established him as the first
Roman emperor
, inaugurating the
Principate
era of the
Roman Empire
.

Reign of Cleopatra § Egypt under the monarchy of Cleopatra
Further information:
Ptolemaic coinage
and
Ancient Greek coinage
Following the tradition of
Macedonian rulers
, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an
absolute monarch
, serving as the
sole lawgiver
of her kingdom.
[350]
She was the
chief religious authority
in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the
Egyptian
and
Greek
polytheistic faiths.
[351]
She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods,
[352]
a synagogue for the
Jews in Egypt
, and even built the
Caesareum of Alexandria
, dedicated to the
cult worship
of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.
[353]
[354]
Cleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain,
[355]
tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign.
[356]
Although the
command economy
that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality,
[357]
the government attempted to impose
price controls
,
tariffs
, and
state monopolies
for certain goods, fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies, and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons.
[358]
[359]
[360]
Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to
debase
her coinage, which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.
[361]

Children and successors

Right: A likely depiction of Cleopatra Selene II, wearing an elephant skin cap, raised relief image on a
gilded
silver dish from the
Boscoreale Treasure
, dated to the early 1st century AD
[364]
[365]
[note 59]
After her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphos, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister
Octavia the Younger
, a former wife of their father, as their guardian.
[366]
[367]
Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC.
[366]
[241]
The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point.
[366]
[241]
Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to
Juba II
, son of
Juba I
, whose North African
kingdom of Numidia
had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey.
[368]
[367]
[326]
The emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, after their wedding in 25 BC, as the new rulers of
Mauretania
, where they transformed the old
Carthaginian
city of
Iol
into their new capital, renamed
Caesarea Mauretaniae
(modern
Cherchell
, Algeria).
[368]
[241]
Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars, artists, and advisers from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea, now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture.
[369]
She also named her son
Ptolemy of Mauretania
, in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.
[370]
[371]
Cleopatra Selene II died
c.
5 BC
, and when Juba II died in 23/24 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy.
[370]
[372]
However, Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor
Caligula
in 40 AD, perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized
regalia
reserved for the Roman emperor.
[373]
[374]
Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty, although Queen
Zenobia
, of the short-lived
Palmyrene Empire
during the
Crisis of the Third Century
, would claim descent from Cleopatra.
[375]
[376]
A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe, an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis, explained that he "overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold."
[377]
Roman literature and historiography

Cleopatra Testing Poisons on Condemned Prisoners
(1887), by
Alexandre Cabanel
[378]
Although almost 50 ancient works of
Roman historiography
mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies.
[379]
Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the
Life of Antonius
written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life.
[380]
[381]
[382]
Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on
primary sources
, such as
Philotas of Amphissa
, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.
[383]
Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports.
[380]
[382]
The
Jewish Roman
historian
Josephus
, writing in the 1st century AD, provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great.
[384]
[385]
However, this work relies largely on Herod's memoirs and the biased account of
Nicolaus of Damascus
, the tutor of Cleopatra's children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herod's court.
[384]
[385]
The
Roman History
published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century AD, while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world, nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatra's reign.
[384]
A restructured marble
Roman statue

diadem
and 'melon' hairstyle similar to coinage portraits, found along the
Via Cassia
near the
Tomba di Nerone
[

, Rome, and now located in the
Museo Pio-Clementino
[1]
[386]
[387]
Cleopatra is barely mentioned in
De Bello Alexandrino
, the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar.
[388]
[389]
[390]
[note 60]
The
writings of Cicero
, who knew her personally, provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra.
[388]
The Augustan-period authors
Virgil
,
Horace
,
Propertius
, and
Ovid
perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime,
[388]
[391]
although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic
melodrama
.
[392]
[note 61]
Horace also viewed Cleopatra's suicide as a positive choice,
[393]
[391]
an idea that found acceptance by the
Late Middle Ages
with
Geoffrey Chaucer
.
[394]
[395]
The historians
Strabo
,
Velleius
,
Valerius Maximus
,
Pliny the Elder
, and
Appian
, while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch, Josephus, or Dio, provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records.
[388]
[note 62]
Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some
Egyptian papyrus documents
demonstrate Cleopatra's point of view, but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works.
[388]
[396]
[note 63]
The fragmentary
Libyka
commissioned by Cleopatra's son-in-law Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatra's perspective.
[388]
Cleopatra's gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient, medieval, and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the
Greco-Roman world
.
[397]
For instance, the historian
Ronald Syme
asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree.
[397]
Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress, she had only two known sexual partners, Caesar and Antony, the two most prominent Romans of the time period, who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty.
[398]
[399]
Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.

[403]
located in the
Capitoline Museums
, Rome
Cleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the
Egyptian
as well as
Hellenistic-Greek
and
Roman
styles.
[2]
Surviving works include statues,
busts
,
reliefs
, and minted coins,
[2]
[378]
as well as ancient
carved cameos
,
[404]
such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the
Altes Museum
, Berlin.
[1]
Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance, there was once a large
gilded
bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the
Temple of Venus Genetrix
in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a
Roman temple
.
[3]
[187]
[405]
It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.
[406]
[407]
A life-sized Roman-style statue of Cleopatra
was found near the
Tomba di Nerone
[
it
]
, Rome, along the
Via Cassia
, and is now housed in the
Museo Pio-Clementino
, part of the
Vatican Museums
.
[1]
[386]
[387]
Plutarch, in his
Life of Antonius
, said that the public statues of Antony were
torn down
by Augustus, but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2,000
talents
to dissuade him from destroying hers.
[408]
[377]
[333]
Since the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the
Esquiline Venus
—discovered in 1874 on the
Esquiline Hill
in Rome and housed in the
Palazzo dei Conservatori
of the
Capitoline Museums
—is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the statue's
hairstyle and facial features
, apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the
uraeus
Egyptian cobra
wrapped around the base.
[403]
[409]
[410]
Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on
the Berlin portrait
and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess
Venus
(or the Greek
Aphrodite
).
[403]
[409]
[410]
However, she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess
Isis
,
[411]
while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite.
[412]
[413]
She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos.
[208]
The
Esquiline Venus
is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD
Roman copy
of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of
Pasiteles
.
[409]
Coinage portraits

,
Roman currency
, and
Ancient Greek coinage
Cleopatra and
Mark Antony
on the
obverse
and reverse, respectively, of a silver
tetradrachm
struck at the
Antioch
mint in 36 BC, with Greek legends: BACIΛΙCCA KΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ ΘΕΑ ΝΕΩΤΕΡΑ, ANTΩNIOC AYTOKPATΩP TPITON TPIΩN ANΔPΩN.
Surviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign include specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC.
[414]
Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins.
[412]
[note 65]
Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on
Roman currency
.
[415]
Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar
aquiline nose
and prominent chin as that of her husband.
[3]
[416]
These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple.
[3]
[2]
Her strong, almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother, softer, and perhaps idealized
sculpted images
of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles.
[2]
[417]
[418]
Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father,
Ptolemy XII Auletes
,
[419]
[117]
and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor
Arsinoe II
(316-260 BC)
[2]
[420]
and even depictions of earlier queens such as
Hatshepsut
and
Nefertiti
.
[418]
It is likely, due to political expediency, that Antony's visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her
Macedonian Greek
ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty, to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.
[2]
The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek, but also in the
nominative case
of Roman coins rather than the
genitive case
of Greek coins, in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones.
[2]
These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and
Hellenistic culture
, and perhaps also a statement to their subjects, however ambiguous to modern scholars, about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other.
[2]
Diana Kleiner
argues that Cleopatra, in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony, made herself more masculine-looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable
Roman client queen
than a Hellenistic ruler.
[417]
Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony, such as the coins struck at the
Ascalon
mint during her brief period of exile to
Syria
and the
Levant
, which
Joann Fletcher
explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.
[117]
[421]
Various coins, such as a silver
tetradrachm
minted sometime after Cleopatra's marriage with Antony in 37 BC, depict her wearing a royal diadem and a
'melon' hairstyle
.
[3]
[421]
The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads.
[422]
[378]
[423]
[note 66]
This hairstyle, with hair braided back into a bun, is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and
Berenice II
in their own coinage.
[3]
[424]
After her visit to Rome in 46-44 BC it became fashionable for
Roman women
to adopt it as one of
their hairstyles
, but it was abandoned for a more modest, austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.
[3]
[422]
[423]
Greco-Roman busts and heads
An ancient
Roman

c.
50-30 BC
, now located in the
British Museum
, London, that depicts a woman from Ptolemaic Egypt, either Queen Cleopatra or a member of her entourage during her 46-44 BC visit to Rome with her lover
Julius Caesar
[422]
Of the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra,
[note 67]
the sculpture known as the "
Berlin Cleopatra
", located in the
Antikensammlung Berlin
collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the "
Vatican Cleopatra
", located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose.
[425]
[426]
[427]
[note 68]
Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.
[426]
[428]
[427]
[note 69]
Both heads are dated to the mid-1st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the
Via Appia
in Italy, the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the
Villa of the Quintilii
.
[3]
[425]
[427]
[note 70]
Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose.
[429]
[note 71]
A third
sculpted portrait of Cleopatra
accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the
Archaeological Museum of Cherchell
, Algeria.
[407]
[362]
[363]
This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads, but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Cleopatra.
[363]
[430]
[235]
[note 48]
A possible
Parian-marble
sculpture of Cleopatra
wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums.
[431]
Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 1st century BC, it is either Roman or Hellenistic-Egyptian in origin.
[432]
Other possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the
British Museum
, London, made of limestone, which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome.
[1]
[422]
The woman in
this portrait
has facial features similar to others (including the pronounced aquiline nose), but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle.
[1]
[422]
However, the British Museum head, once belonging to a full statue, could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia (i.e. the diadem) to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome.
[422]
Duane W. Roller
speculates that the British Museum head, along with those in the
Egyptian Museum
, Cairo, the Capitoline Museums, and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen, while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem, most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatra's popular hairstyle.

as a

, mid-1st century BC
[409]
[434]
In the
House of Marcus Fabius Rufus
at
Pompeii
, Italy, a mid-1st century BC
Second Style
wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a
cupid
near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as
Venus Genetrix
with her son Caesarion.
[409]
[434]
The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the
Forum of Caesar
in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra.
[409]
[434]
This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as
this painting at Pompeii
.
[409]
[435]
The
woman in the painting
wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra, which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupid's arm may have been torn off.
[409]
[436]
[427]
[note 72]
The room with the painting was walled off by its owner, perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian, when public depictions of Cleopatra's son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.
[409]
[437]
Behind her golden diadem, crowned with a red jewel, is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the "melon" hairstyle favored by the queen.
[436]
[note 73]
Her
ivory-white skin
, round face, long aquiline nose, and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities.
[436]
Roller affirms that "there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and, as such, it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen."

Another painting from Pompeii
, dated to the early 1st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II, contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion, both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide.
[303]
[304]
[note 74]
The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman
Sophonisba
, who toward the end of the
Second Punic War
(218-201 BC) drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover
Masinissa
,
King of Numidia
.
[303]
Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family, Masinissa and
Ptolemy VIII Physcon
having been associates, and Cleopatra's own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.
[303]
Sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made, while Cleopatra's suicide was far more famous.
[303]
An asp is absent from the painting, but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite.
[441]
A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting, positioned very high above the people in it, suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria.
[303]
A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial
Egyptian crocodile
(possibly an elaborate tray handle), while another man standing by is

[303]
In 1818 a now lost
encaustic painting
was discovered in the Temple of
Serapis
at
Hadrian's Villa
, near
Tivoli, Lazio
, Italy, that
depicted Cleopatra committing suicide
with an asp biting her bare chest.
[438]
A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of one-third
wax
and two-thirds
resin
.
[438]
The thickness of the painting over Cleopatra's bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the
Fayum mummy portraits
.
[442]
A
steel engraving
published by
John Sartain
in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing
authentic clothing
and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period,
[443]
as well as the
radiant crown
of the Ptolemaic rulers, as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns.
[440]
After Cleopatra's suicide, Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake, parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome.
[442]
[339]
[315]
The portrait painting of Cleopatra's death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor
Hadrian
to decorate his private villa, where it was found in an
Egyptian temple
.

An ancient Roman fresco in the
Pompeian Third Style
possibly depicting Cleopatra, from the House of the Orchard at
Pompeii
, Italy, mid-1st century AD
[49]
A Roman
panel painting
from
Herculaneum
, Italy, dated to the 1st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra.
[49]
[50]
In it she wears a royal diadem, red or reddish-brown hair pulled back into a bun,
[note 76]
pearl-studded hairpins,
[444]
and earrings with ball-shaped pendants,
the white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background
.
[49]
Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage.
[49]
A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the
House of the Orchard
at Pompeii features Egyptian-style imagery, such as a Greek-style
sphinx
, and may have been created by the same artist.

Portland Vase

Portland Vase
A possible depiction of
Mark Antony
on the
Portland Vase
being lured by Cleopatra, straddling a serpent, while Anton, Antony's alleged ancestor, looks on and
Eros
flies above
[445]
[446]
The
Portland Vase
, a
Roman
cameo glass
vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony.
[445]
[447]
In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e. the asp) rises between her legs,
Eros
floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom.
[445]
[446]
The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus.
[445]
[446]
The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.

at the
Temple of Dendera
, Egypt, 1st century BC
The
Bust of Cleopatra
in the
Royal Ontario Museum
represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style.
[448]
Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt.
[448]
The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art.
[449]
The
Dendera Temple complex
, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of
Hathor
depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making
offerings to the gods
.
[450]
[451]
Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.
[450]
[452]
A large Ptolemaic black
basalt
statue measuring 104 centimetres (41 in) in height, now in the
Hermitage Museum
,
Saint Petersburg
, is thought to represent Arsinoe II, wife of
Ptolemy II
, but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress, an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over
Lower
and
Upper Egypt
.
[408]
[404]
[402]
The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided, double
cornucopia
(
dikeras
), which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra.
[408]
[402]
In his
Kleopatra und die Caesaren
(2006),
Bernard Andreae
[
de
]
contends that this basalt statue, like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen, does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance.
[453]
[note 77]
Adrian Goldsworthy
writes that, despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style, Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only "perhaps for certain rites" and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch, which would include the Greek headband seen in her Greco-Roman busts.

The Banquet of Cleopatra
(1744), by
Giovanni Battista Tiepolo
, now in the
National Gallery of Victoria
, Melbourne
[456]
In modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture,
[378]
a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films.
[457]
This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter.
[458]
The 14th-century English poet
Geoffrey Chaucer
, in
The Legend of Good Women
, contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the
Middle Ages
.
[459]
His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining
knight
engaged in
courtly love
, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.
[459]
Chaucer highlighted Cleopatra's relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in
De Mulieribus Claris
and
De Casibus Virorum Illustrium
, Latin works by the 14th-century Italian poet
Giovanni Boccaccio
.
[460]
[395]
The
Renaissance humanist
Bernardino Cacciante
[
it
]
, in his 1504
Libretto apologetico delle donne
, was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccio's works.
[461]
Works of Islamic historiography
written in Arabic
covered the reign of Cleopatra, such as the 10th-century
Meadows of Gold
by
Al-Masudi
,
[462]
although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatra's suicide.
[463]
Cleopatra appeared in
miniatures
for
illuminated manuscripts
, such as a
depiction of her and Antony
lying in a
Gothic-style
tomb by the
Boucicaut Master
in 1409.
[394]
In the visual arts, the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude figure committing suicide began with the 16th-century sculptors
Bartolommeo Bandinelli
and
Alessandro Vittoria
.
[464]
Early prints
depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists
Raphael
and
Michelangelo
, as well as 15th-century
woodcuts
in illustrated editions of Boccaccio's works.
[465]
In the performing arts, the death of
Elizabeth I of England
in 1603, and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra, inspired
Samuel Daniel
to alter and republish his 1594 play
Cleopatra
in 1607.
[466]
He was followed by
William Shakespeare
, whose
Antony and Cleopatra
, largely based on Plutarch, was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to England's own
Virgin Queen
.
[467]
Cleopatra was also featured in operas, such as
George Frideric Handel
's 1724
Giulio Cesare in Egitto
, which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra;
[468]
Domenico Cimarosa
wrote
Cleopatra
on a similar subject in 1789.

The Triumph of Cleopatra
(1821), by
William Etty
, now in the
Lady Lever Art Gallery
,
Port Sunlight
, England
In
Victorian Britain
, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient
Egyptian culture
and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps,
lithographs
, postcards and cigarettes.
[470]
Fictional novels
such as
H. Rider Haggard
's
Cleopatra
(1889) and
Théophile Gautier
's
One of Cleopatra's Nights
(1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist
Georg Ebers
's
Cleopatra
(1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy.
[470]
[471]
The French dramatist
Victorien Sardou
and Irish playwright
George Bernard Shaw
produced plays about Cleopatra, while
burlesque
shows such as
F. C. Burnand
's
Antony and Cleopatra
offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.
[472]
Shakespeare's
Antony and Cleopatra
was considered canonical by the Victorian era.
[473]
Its popularity led to the perception that
the 1885 painting
by
Lawrence Alma-Tadema
depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus, although Alma-Tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria.
[474]
Also based on Shakespeare's play was
Samuel Barber
's opera
Antony and Cleopatra
(1966), commissioned for the opening of the
Metropolitan Opera House
.
[475]
In his unfinished 1825 short story
The Egyptian Nights
,
Alexander Pushkin
popularized the claims of the 4th-century Roman historian
Aurelius Victor
, previously largely ignored, that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives.
[476]
[477]
Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East, as the
Qing-dynasty
Chinese scholar
Yan Fu
wrote an extensive biography of her.
[478]
Georges Méliès
's
Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb
(French:
Cléopâtre
), an 1899 French
silent
horror film, was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra.
[479]
Hollywood
films of the 20th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media, which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by
Theda Bara
in
Cleopatra
(1917),
Claudette Colbert
in
Cleopatra
(1934), and
Elizabeth Taylor
in
Cleopatra
(1963).
[480]
In addition to her portrayal as a "
vampire
" queen, Bara's Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th-century
Orientalist painting
, such as
despotic behavior
, mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality.
[481]
Colbert's character of Cleopatra served as a
glamour model
for selling Egyptian-themed products in department stores in the 1930s, targeting female moviegoers.
[482]
In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra,
women's magazines
of the early 1960s advertised how to use makeup, clothes, jewelry, and hairstyles to achieve the "Egyptian" look similar to the queens Cleopatra and
Nefertiti
.
[483]
By the end of the 20th century there were forty-three films, two hundred plays and novels, forty-five operas, and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.
[484]
Written works
Further information:
Ancient Greek literature
and
Ancient Egyptian literature
Whereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on
ancient Greek medicine
attributed to her are, likely to be the work of a
physician
by the same name writing in the late first century AD.
[485]
Ingrid D. Rowland, who highlights that the "Berenice called Cleopatra" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician
Metrodora
was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra.
[486]
Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings, such as those preserved by
Galen
, including remedies for
hair disease
, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of
weights and measures
for
pharmacological
purposes.
[487]
[20]
[488]
Aëtius of Amida
attributed a recipe for
perfumed
soap to Cleopatra, while
Paul of Aegina
preserved alleged instructions of hers for
dyeing and curling hair
.

dynasty of the
Ptolemies
,
[9]
[490]
[491]
[note 78]
their
European origins
tracing back to
northern Greece
.
[492]
Through her father,
Ptolemy XII Auletes
, she was a descendant of two
prominent companions
of
Alexander the Great
of
Macedon
: the general
Ptolemy I Soter
, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and
Seleucus I Nicator
, the Macedonian Greek founder of the
Seleucid Empire
of West Asia.
[9]
[493]
[494]
[note 79]
While Cleopatra's
paternal line
can be traced, the identity of her mother is uncertain.
[495]
[496]
[497]
[note 80]
She was presumably the daughter of
Cleopatra V Tryphaena
,
[note 3]
the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV.
[14]
[496]
[498]
[note 81]
Cleopatra I Syra
was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non-Greek ancestry.
[499]
[500]
Her mother
Laodice III
was a daughter born to King
Mithridates II of Pontus
, a Persian of the
Mithridatic dynasty
, and his wife
Laodice
who had a mixed Greek-Persian heritage.
[501]
Cleopatra I Syra
's father
Antiochus III the Great
was a descendant of Queen
Apama
, the
Sogdian
Iranian
wife of Seleucus I Nicator.
[499]
[500]
[502]
[note 82]
It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native
Egyptians
.
[41]
[503]
[note 83]
Michael Grant
asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and "would have described herself as Greek."
[499]
[note 84]
Stacy Schiff
writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress.
[504]
[note 85]
Duane W. Roller
speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from
Memphis
in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to
Ptah
(a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship),
[note 86]
but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most.
[505]
[note 87]
Ernle Bradford
writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman "but as a civilized Greek."
[506]
Claims that Cleopatra was an
illegitimate
child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her.
[36]
[507]
[note 88]
Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate.
[36]
[507]
[508]
Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife.
[42]
The high degree of
inbreeding
among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below.
[note 89]
The family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of
Ptolemy X Alexander I
and
Berenice III
. This would make her a cousin of her husband, Ptolemy XII, but she could have been a daughter of
Ptolemy IX Lathyros
, which would have made her a sister-wife of Ptolemy XII instead.
[509]
[36]
The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XII's wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI; the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a co-ruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC (during Ptolemy XII's exile in Rome).

Biography
[
edit
]
Rudi Španzel graduated from the
Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana
. He is one of the few contemporary painters who create on the principle of
Renaissance
artists, who have insisted on
realism
and deep symbolism. He has received many domestic and foreign awards for achievements, among them the
Prešeren Fund Award
in 1985. He painted portraits on
Slovenian tolar
banknotes, in circulation from October 1991 until the introduction of

[1]
Category B
: "buildings of regional or more than local importance; or major examples of some particular period, style or building type, which may have been altered."
[1]
Category C
: "buildings of local importance; lesser examples of any period, style, or building type, as originally constructed or moderately altered; and simple traditional buildings which group well with other listed buildings."

The "
World's Largest Dinosaur
", a roadside attraction in
Drumheller
,
Alberta
A
roadside attraction
is a feature along the side of a road meant to attract
tourists
. In general, these are places one might stop on the way to somewhere, rather than being a destination. They are frequently advertised with
billboards
. The modern tourist-oriented highway attraction originated as a
U.S.
and
Canadian
phenomenon in the 1940s to 1960s,
[1]
and subsequently caught on in
Australia
.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
When long-distance road travel became practical and famous in the 1920s, entrepreneurs began building restaurants, motels, coffee shops, cafes, and unusual businesses to attract travelers.
[3]
[4]
Many of the buildings were attractions in themselves in the form of
novelty architecture
, depicting everyday objects of enormous size, typically relating to the items sold there.
[5]
Some other types of roadside attractions include monuments and fictionalized-paranormal/illusionary amusements such as the
Mystery Spot
near Santa Cruz, California,
[6]
or curiosities such as
The Thing?
along
Interstate 10
in Arizona.
[7]
With the construction of the U.S.
Interstate Highway System
in the mid-1950s, many roadside attractions were bypassed and quickly went out of business.
[4]
Some remained attractive enough to divert travelers from the interstate for a brief respite and thus remain in business. The best example of this change is along
US Route 66
, where in the southwest,
Interstate 40
provided for non-stop travel.
[8]
[9]
In 2017, the publication
Best Life
listed 33 top roadside attractions in the U.S. Among those listed were
Lucy the Elephant
, Margate, NJ;
Cabazon Dinosaurs
, Cabazon, CA;
Oregon Vortex
, Gold Hill, OR;
Jolly Green Giant
, Blue Earth, MN; and Secret Caverns, Howes Cave, NY.

History
[
edit
]
Efforts to bring trade unionists together across Manchester go back to the eighteenth century.  In 1818 the cotton spinners persuaded other trades to join them in a successful but short lived Philanthropic Society. The first use of the name Trades Council was a meeting in 1837 of the United Trades Council of Manchester and Salford organising support for the Glasgow Cotton Spinners. A thousand people in the Corn Exchange  listened to speakers including J.R. Richardson, author of ‘The Rights of Women’ and
Joseph Rayner Stephens
, both of whom went on to be active
Chartists
.
[1]
Following a trade union conference in Sheffield in July 1866 called to discuss the use of the lockout weapon by employers, two delegates from the Manchester Typographical Association, William Henry Wood and Samuel Caldwell Nicholson, convened the inaugural meeting of the Manchester and Salford Trades Union Council in October 1866. A month later Wood was elected secretary and Nicholson president.
[2]
Wood and Nicholson were Conservative working men. Other members of the council included the radicals Peter Shorrocks of the Tailors, William MacDonald of the Operative Housepainters and Malcolm MacLeod, an engineer. When the Council decided to avoid identifying with any political movement, the radicals set up the Trade Unionists Political Association with MacDonald as president and MacLeod as secretary.
[3]
One of the Trades Council's first decisions was the proposal to form a court of arbitration.  Set up jointly with the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in 1868, it was short-lived, failing to arbitrate a single case.
[4]
More significantly in February that year, the council called a national conference of trade unionists which met in June and agreed to form what became the Trades Union Congress.  Woods was elected president and Shorrocks secretary.
[5]
This soon became the leading national association of trade unions.
Peter Shorrocks played a leading role in establishing the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and was an active supporter of the
International Workingmen's Association
, the First International.
[6]
He succeeded Wood to be secretary from 1877 to 1883. He was followed as secretary by
George Davy Kelley
, full-time secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers and a member of the General Council of the Manchester Liberal Association.
[7]
Kelley helped to greatly increase affiliations to the council. Many of the new affiliations were general unions of unskilled workers, a development which Kelley opposed as he felt the organisations would not endure, but they soon came to dominate the council. Despite this, Kelley remained the council's most prominent figure, being elected to Manchester City Council in 1891 as a Liberal-Labour representative.
[8]
In 1902, the council convened a meeting of local trade unionists and members of the
Independent Labour Party
and
Social Democratic Federation
, which renamed the council as the
Manchester Trades and Labour Council
, becoming the local affiliate of the
Labour Representation Committee
.
[9]
Two years later, Kelley broke his links with the Liberals, and in 1906 he was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament, standing down from his trades council posts.
[8]
In the 1920s, the council affiliated to the
Communist Party of Great Britain
-led
National Minority Movement
.
[10]
Although the
Labour Party
set up its own Manchester Borough organisation, the council continued to campaign on a wide range of labour issues, remaining the leading labour movement organisation in the city into the 1930s, and attracted the support of
John Maynard Keynes
for its proposals on local industrial policy.
[11]
In 1974, Salford District Trades Council was created, and the Manchester Trades Union Council adopted its present name.

The
Maya civilization
(
/
ˈ
m
aɪ
ə
/
) was a
Mesoamerican
civilization that existed from
antiquity
to the
early modern period
. It is known by
its ancient temples
and
glyphs
(script). The
Maya script
is the most sophisticated and highly developed
writing system
in the
pre-Columbian
Americas
. The civilization is also noted for
its art
,
architecture
,
mathematics
,
calendar
, and
astronomical system
.
The Maya civilization developed in the
Maya Region
, an area that today comprises southeastern
Mexico
, all of
Guatemala
and
Belize
, and the western portions of
Honduras
and
El Salvador
. It includes the
northern lowlands
of the
Yucatán Peninsula
and the
Guatemalan Highlands
of the
Sierra Madre
, the Mexican state of
Chiapas
, southern
Guatemala
, El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. Today, their descendants, known collectively as the Maya, number well over 6 million individuals, speak more than twenty-eight surviving
Mayan languages
, and reside in nearly the same area as their ancestors.
The
Archaic period
, before 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Preclassic period (
c.
2000 BC to 250 AD
) saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region, and the cultivation of the staple crops of the
Maya diet
, including
maize
,
beans
,
squashes
, and
chili peppers
. The first
Maya cities
developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture, including large temples with elaborate
stucco
façades. Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic, a number of large cities developed in the
Petén Basin
, and the city of
Kaminaljuyu
rose to prominence in the
Guatemalan Highlands
. Beginning around 250 AD, the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with
Long Count dates
. This period saw the Maya civilization develop many
city-states
linked by a complex
trade network
. In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of
Tikal
and
Calakmul
, became powerful. The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of
Teotihuacan
in Maya dynastic politics. In the 9th century, there was a widespread
political collapse
in the central Maya region, resulting in
civil wars
, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population. The Postclassic period saw the rise of
Chichen Itza
in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive
Kʼicheʼ kingdom
in the Guatemalan Highlands. In the 16th century, the
Spanish Empire
colonised the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of
Nojpetén
, the last Maya city, in 1697.
Rule during the Classic period centred on the concept of the "divine king", who was thought to act as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm. Kingship was usually (but not exclusively)
[1]
patrilineal
, and power normally
passed to the eldest son
. A prospective king was expected to be a successful war leader as well as a ruler. Closed patronage systems were the dominant force in Maya politics, although how patronage affected the political makeup of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Classic period, the aristocracy had grown in size, reducing the previously exclusive power of the king. The Maya developed sophisticated art forms using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including
wood
,
jade
,
obsidian
,
ceramics
, sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals.
Maya cities tended to expand organically. The city centers comprised ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregularly shaped sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city were often linked by
causeways
. Architecturally, city buildings included
palaces
,
pyramid-temples
,
ceremonial ballcourts
, and structures specially aligned for astronomical observation. The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing. Theirs was the most advanced writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in
screenfold books
, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. In addition, a great many examples of Maya texts can be found on
stelae
and ceramics. The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest known instances of the explicit
zero
in human history. As a part of their religion, the Maya practised
human sacrifice
.
Etymology
"Maya" is a modern term used to refer collectively to the various peoples that inhabited this area. They did not call themselves "Maya" and did not have a sense of common identity or political unity.
[2]
Geography
Main article:
Maya Region
Maya area
The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America. This area included the entire Yucatán Peninsula and all of the territory now in the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize, as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.
[3]
Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline.
[4]
The territory of the Maya covered a third of
Mesoamerica
,
[5]
and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the
Olmecs
,
Mixtecs
, Teotihuacan, and
Aztecs
.
[6]
During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended into the highlands of central Mexico;
[7]
there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan.
[8]
The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant
Toltec
capital of
Tula
had an especially
close relationship
.
[9]
The Petén region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain;
[10]
a chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén.
[11]
To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands.
[12]
The dense
Maya forest
covers northern Petén and Belize, most of
Quintana Roo
, southern
Campeche
, and a portion of the south of
Yucatán
state. Farther north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub.
[13]
The
littoral zone
of
Soconusco
lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas,
[14]
and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre.
[15]
The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the
Sierra de los Cuchumatanes
. Their major pre-Columbian population centres were in the largest highland valleys, such as the
Valley of Guatemala
and the
Quetzaltenango
Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into
Verapaz
, and gradually descend to the east.
[16]
History
Main article:
History of the Maya civilization
The history of Maya civilization is divided into three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic.
[17]
These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged.
[18]
Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline.
[19]
Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.

Main article:
Preclassic Maya
Kaminaljuyu
, in the highlands, and
El Mirador
, in the lowlands, were both important cities in the Late Preclassic.
The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period.
[24]
Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at
Cuello
(modern Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC.
[25]
Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper.
[26]
This period was characterised by
sedentary
communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.
[27]
During the
Middle Preclassic Period
, small villages began to grow to form cities.
[28]
Nakbe
in the Petén department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands,
[29]
where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC.
[28]
The northern lowlands of Yucatán were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic.
[30]
By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae.
[31]
A developed script was already being used in Petén by the 3rd century BC.
[32]
In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of
El Mirador
grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi).
[33]
Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC.
[34]
In the highlands,
Kaminaljuyu
emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic.
[35]
Takalik Abaj
and
Chocolá
were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain,
[36]
and
Komchen
grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán.
[37]
The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.
[38]
Classic period (c. 250-900 AD)
Stela D from
Quiriguá
, representing king
Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat
[39]
The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar.
[40]
This period marked the peak of large-scale construction and
urbanism
, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions.
[40]
The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of
Renaissance Italy
or
Classical Greece
, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities.
[41]
The largest cities had 50,000 to 120,000 people and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.
[42]
During the Early Classic, cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of
Teotihuacan
in the distant
Valley of Mexico
.
[43]
In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty.
[44]
This intervention was led by
Siyaj Kʼakʼ
("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal,
Chak Tok Ichʼaak I
, died on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover.
[45]
A year later, Siyaj Kʼakʼ oversaw the installation of a new king,
Yax Nuun Ahiin I
.
[46]
This led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.
[46]
Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.
[47]
Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with members of the network.
[48]
Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.
[49]
Calakmul
was one of the most important Classic period cities.
In 629,
Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil
, a son of the Tikal king Kʼinich Muwaan Jol II, was sent to found a new city at
Dos Pilas
, in the
Petexbatún
region, apparently as an outpost to extend Tikal's power beyond the reach of Calakmul.
[50]
For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal. In 648, king
Yuknoom Chʼeen II
of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan Kʼawiil. Yuknoom Chʼeen II then reinstated Balaj Chan Kʼawiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal.
[51]
He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul.
[52]
In the southeast,
Copán
was the most important city.
[47]
Its Classic-period dynasty was founded in 426 by
Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ
. The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan.
[53]
Copán reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of
Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil
, who ruled from 695 to 738.
[54]
His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal, king
Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat
of
Quiriguá
.
[55]
The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual.
[56]
It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal.
[57]
Palenque
and
Yaxchilan
were the most powerful cities in the
Usumacinta
region.
[47]
In the highlands,
Kaminaljuyu
in the
Valley of Guatemala
was already a sprawling city by 300.
[58]
In the north of the Maya area,
Coba
was the most important capital.
[59]
Classic Maya collapse
Main article:
Classic Maya collapse
Chichen Itza
was the most important city in the northern Maya region.
During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity.
[43]
No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe
environmental degradation
, and
drought
.
[60]
During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and
Uxmal
showed increased activity.
[43]
Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula were inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.
[61]
Classic Maya social organization was based on the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by
tradition
to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate systemic problems.
[62]
By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.
[63]
Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.
[64]
Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.
[42]
One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at
Toniná
in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.

League of Mayapan
Zaculeu
was capital of the Postclassic
Mam
kingdom in the
Guatemalan Highlands
.
[66]
Although much reduced, a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.
[67]
Unlike during previous cycles of contraction, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic.
[42]
Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths.
[68]
Chichen Itza and its
Puuc
neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of
Mayapan
in the 12th century. New cities arose near the
Caribbean
and
Gulf
coasts, and new trade networks were formed.
[69]
The Postclassic Period was marked by changes from the preceding Classic Period.
[70]
The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the
Valley of Guatemala
was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years.
[71]
Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of
warfare
.
[

Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the natural terrain.
[71]
One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was
Qʼumarkaj
, the capital of the aggressive
Kʼicheʼ kingdom
.
[70]
The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organised as joint rule by a council. However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors.
[72]
Mayapan
was an important Postclassic city in the northern
Yucatán Peninsula
.
Mayapan was abandoned around 1448, after a period of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the
southern Maya region
. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511.
[73]
Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces.
[69]
During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization.
[74]
On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states.
[75]
The
Kʼicheʼ
had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish conquest of the
Kaqchikel kingdom
had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the Kʼicheʼ.

In 1511, a Spanish
caravel
was wrecked in the Caribbean, and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of Yucatán. They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were
sacrificed
, although two escaped. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast, and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants.
[77]
After the Aztec capital
Tenochtitlan
fell to the Spanish in 1521,
Hernán Cortés
despatched
Pedro de Alvarado
to Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico;
[78]
they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.
[79]
The Kʼicheʼ capital, Qʼumarkaj, fell to Alvarado in 1524.
[80]
Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into
Iximche
, the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya.
[81]
Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later.
[82]
This was followed by the fall of
Zaculeu
, the Mam Maya capital, in 1525.
[83]
Francisco de Montejo
and his son,
Francisco de Montejo the Younger
, launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546.
[84]
This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent.

In 1697,
Martín de Ursúa
launched an assault on the
Itza
capital
Nojpetén
and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.

Persistence of Maya culture
Main article:
Maya peoples
The Spanish conquest stripped away most of the defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life.
[87]
The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by
Catholic
missionaries.
[88]
The 260-day
tzolkʼin
ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas,
[89]
and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.

Investigation of Maya civilization

The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at
Christianization
, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire.
[91]
This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America.
[92]
In 1839, American traveller and writer
John Lloyd Stephens
set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman
Frederick Catherwood
.
[93]
Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya to world attention.
[91]
The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.
[94]
The final two decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern scientific archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of
Alfred Maudslay
and
Teoberto Maler
.
[95]
By the early 20th century, the
Peabody Museum
was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula.
[96]
In the first two decades of the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts.
[97]
Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.
[98]

In the 1960s, Mayanist
J. Eric S. Thompson
promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests.
[99]
These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin,
Tatiana Proskouriakoff
, and
Yuri Knorozov
.
[100]
With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, undermining the view of the Maya as peaceful.
[101]
Politics
Unlike the
Aztecs
and the
Inca
, the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both
states
and
chiefdoms
. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul,
Caracol
, Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC.
[102]
During the Late Preclassic, the Maya political system coalesced into a
theopolitical
form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion.
[103]
The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army.
[104]
Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives.
[105]
Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict.
[106]
The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours.
[107]
In the Late Classic, some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over
Naranjo
for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city.
[108]
Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently.
[109]
Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres.
[110]
Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.
[111]
Society
Main article:
Maya society
See also:
Women in Maya society
From the Early Preclassic, Maya society was sharply divided between the elite and commoners. As population increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialised, and political organization increasingly complex.
[112]
By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied.
[113]
A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking
priests
and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves.
[114]
According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or
clans
. Such clans held that the land was the property of the ancestors, and ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.
[115]
King and court
Stela

Toniná
, representing the 6th-century king Bahlam Yaxuun Tihl
[116]
Classic Maya rule was centred in a royal culture that was displayed in all areas of Classic Maya art. The king was the supreme ruler and held a semi-divine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods. From very early times, kings were specifically identified with the
young maize god
, whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization. Maya royal succession was
patrilineal
, and royal power only passed to
queens
when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty. Typically, power was passed to the eldest son. A young prince was called a
chʼok
("youth"), although this word later came to refer to nobility in general. The royal heir was called
bʼaah chʼok
("head youth"). Various points in the prince's
childhood
were marked by ritual; the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six. Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance, the heir also had to be a successful war leader, as demonstrated by taking of captives. The enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony, involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a
jaguar-skin
cushion, human sacrifice, and receiving the symbols of royal power, such as a headband bearing a jade representation of the so-called "jester god", an elaborate headdress adorned with
quetzal
feathers, and a sceptre representing the god
Kʼawiil
.
[117]
Maya political administration, based around the royal court, was not bureaucratic in nature. Government was hierarchical, and official posts were sponsored by higher-ranking members of the aristocracy; officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office over their lives. Officials are referred to as being "owned" by their sponsor, and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor.
[118]
The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution.
[119]
There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court, instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context.
[120]
A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by
epigraphers
translating Classic Maya inscriptions.
Ajaw
is usually translated as "lord" or "king". In the Early Classic, an
ajaw
was the ruler of a city. Later, with increasing social complexity, the
ajaw
was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one, each ruling over different districts.
[121]
Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word
kʼuhul
to their
ajaw
title. A
kʼuhul ajaw
was "divine lord", originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines.
[122]
Kalomte
was a royal title, whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered, but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties. It indicated an overlord, or
high king
, and was only in use during the Classic period.
[123]
By the Late Classic, the absolute power of the
kʼuhul ajaw
had weakened, and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy, that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately.
[124]

[125]
A
sajal
was ranked below the
ajaw
, and indicated a subservient lord. A
sajal
would be lord of a second- or third-tier site, answering to an
ajaw
, who may himself have been subservient to a
kalomte
.
[121]
A
sajal
would often be a war captain or regional governor, and inscriptions often link the
sajal
title to warfare; they are often mentioned as the holders of war captives.
[126]
Sajal
meant "feared one".
[127]
The titles of
ah tzʼihb
and
ah chʼul hun
are both related to scribes. The
ah tzʼihb
was a royal scribe, usually a member of the royal family; the
ah chʼul hun
was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is closely associated with the
ajaw
title, indicating that an
ajaw
always held the
ah chʼul hun
title simultaneously.
[128]
Other courtly titles, the functions of which are not well understood, were
yajaw kʼahk'
("Lord of Fire"),
tiʼhuun
and
ti'sakhuun
. These last two may be variations on the same title,
[129]
and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler.
[130]
Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male-oriented, and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman, they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty.
[131]
Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities, indicating that such office holders either owned that structure, or that the structure was an important focus for their activities.
[132]
A
lakam
, or standard-bearer, was possibly the only non-elite post-holder in the royal court.
[118]
The
lakam
was only found in larger sites, and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts.
[118]
Different factions may have existed in the royal court. The
kʼuhul ahaw
and his household would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included
ritual dances
, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.
[133]
Commoners
Commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively little is known about them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive
remote-sensing
surveys of apparently empty terrain.
[134]
The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions.
[135]
Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as
cotton
and
cacao
, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools.
[136]
Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors.
[137]
Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize, flour and game.
[110]
It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.
[138]
Warfare

Warfare was prevalent in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions.
[139]
Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took.
[140]
In the 8th-9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén.
[140]
The rapid abandonment of
Aguateca
by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry
in situ
.
[141]
Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.
[142]
From as early as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with
trophy heads
hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives.
[139]
Right up to the end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed.
[137]
The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.
[143]
The outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on the defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca.
[144]
In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.
[145]
Warriors
During the Contact period, certain military positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialised knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances.
[137]
Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders.
[146]
Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare.
[147]
Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.
[148]
There is some evidence from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war, but they did not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens.
[149]
By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle.
[137]
Weapons

Yaxchilán
, depicting king

[150]
The
atlatl
(spear-thrower) was introduced to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic.
[151]
This was a 0.5-metre-long (1.6 ft) stick with a notched end to hold a
dart
or
javelin
.
[152]
The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than simply hurling it with the arm.
[151]
Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior.
[153]
Commoners used
blowguns
in war, which also served as their hunting weapon.
[151]
The
bow and arrow
was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting.
[140]
Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured;
[154]
it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic.
[151]
The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian,
[155]
similar to the Aztec
macuahuitl
. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region.
[156]
Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.
[147]
Trade
Main article:
Trade in Maya civilization
Trade was a key component of Maya society, and in the development of the Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Qʼumarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and
Chalchuapa
in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history.
[157]
The Maya were major producers of
cotton
, which was used to make the textiles to be traded throughout Mesoamerica.
[158]
The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt.
[157]
In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing
slave trade
with wider Mesoamerica.
[159]
The Maya engaged in long-distance trade across the Maya region, and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond. As an illustration, an Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.
[160]
Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast. In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from
Colombia
and
Panama
, and
turquoise
from
Los Cerrillos, New Mexico
. Long-distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family. Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies.
[157]
Trade routes not only supplied physical goods, they facilitated the movement of people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica.
[161]
Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse.
[157]
Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity;
[157]
for example, the Contact period
Manche Chʼol
traded the prestige crops of cacao,
annatto
and
vanilla
into colonial Verapaz.
[162]
Merchants
Little is known of Maya merchants, although they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress, so at least some were members of the elite. During the Contact period, Maya nobility took part in long-distance trading expeditions.
[163]
The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long-distance trading that was the preserve of the elite.
[164]
The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the
underworld
; the patron deities of merchants were two
underworld gods
carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.
[160]
The Maya had no pack animals, so all trade goods were carried on the backs of porters when going overland; if the trade route followed a river or the coast, then goods were transported in canoes.
[165]
A substantial Maya trading canoe made from a large hollowed-out tree trunk was encountered off Honduras on
Christopher Columbus
's
fourth voyage
. The canoe was 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) broad and was powered by 25 rowers. Trade goods carried included cacao, obsidian, ceramics, textiles, and copper bells and axes.
[166]
Cacao was used as currency (although not exclusively), and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod, and stuffing it with dirt or
avocado
rind.
[167]
Marketplaces
Marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically.
[168]
However, the Spanish reported a thriving
market economy
when they arrived in the region.
[169]
At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls.
[170]
A 2007 study compared soils from a modern Guatemalan market to a proposed ancient market at
Chunchucmil
; unusually high levels of
zinc
and
phosphorus
at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic.
[171]
Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis.
[172]
When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.

Maya art is essentially the art of the royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas.
[176]
Maya art has many regional
styles
, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text.
[177]
The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.
[178]
The Maya exhibited a preference for the colour green or blue-green, and used the same word for the colours blue and green. Correspondingly, they placed high value on apple-green jade, and other
greenstones
, associating them with the sun-god
Kʼinich Ajau
. They sculpted artefacts that included fine
tesserae
and beads, to carved heads weighing 4.42 kilograms (9.7 lb).
[179]
The Maya nobility practised
dental modification
, and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth. Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade, such as that of
Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal
, king of Palenque.

Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition, suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood.
[182]
Because of the
biodegradability
of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels.
[183]
Stone
Maya stelae
are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature.
[184]
Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone
relief
panels at Palenque and
Piedras Negras
.
[185]
At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture.
[186]
The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.
[187]
The largest Maya sculptures consisted of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted.
[188]
Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.
[189]
The Maya had a long tradition of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC.
[190]
Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol,
Río Azul
, and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at
Bonampak
.

Flint
,
chert
, and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture, but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools.
[193]
Eccentric flints
are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya.
[194]
They were technically very challenging to produce,
[195]
requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan. Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over 30 centimetres (12 in) in length.
[196]
Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human, animal and geometric forms associated with
Maya religion
.
[195]
Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms, such as crescents, crosses, snakes, and scorpions.
[197]
The largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads, with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one.
[198]
Maya textiles are very poorly represented in the archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the
Andean region
, it is likely that they were high-value items.
[199]
Scraps of textile have been recovered, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but
jaguar
pelts and deer hides are also shown.
[200]

Sacul
Ceramic figurine from
Jaina Island
, AD 650-800
Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art. The Maya had no knowledge of the
potter's wheel
, and Maya vessels were built up by
coiling rolled strips
of clay into the desired form. Maya pottery was not glazed, although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing. Maya ceramics were painted with clay
slips
blended with minerals and coloured clays. Ancient Maya
firing techniques
have yet to be replicated.
[201]
A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on
Jaina Island
, in northern Yucatán. They stand from 10 to 25 centimetres (3.9 to 9.8 in) high and were hand modelled, with exquisite detail.
[202]
The
Ik
-style
polychrome ceramic corpus, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, originated in Late Classic Motul de San José. It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic meetings, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.
[203]
Bone, both human and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors.
[182]
The Maya valued
Spondylus
shells, and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior.
[204]
Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the
lost-wax method
to
cast
small metal pieces.
[205]
One poorly studied area of Maya
folk art
is
graffiti
.
[206]
Additional graffiti, not part of the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of interior walls, floors, and benches, in a wide variety of buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.
[207]
Architecture
Main article:
Maya architecture
The Puuc-style
Labna
gateway. The passage is formed by a
corbel arch
, a common element in Maya architecture.
The Maya produced a vast array of structures, and have left an extensive architectural legacy. Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts. Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralised organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce. It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686
man-days
to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut.
[208]
It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster. Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers. A Classic-period city like Tikal was spread over 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi), with an urban core covering 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of man-days.
[209]
The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period.
[210]
Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic, and would have required planners and architects.
[209]
Urban design
Main article:
Maya city
Reconstruction of the
urban core
of
Tikal
in the 8th century AD
Maya cities were not formally planned, and were subject to irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings.
[211]
Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture.
[212]
Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes.
[211]
The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls.
[213]
These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools.
[214]
Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city.
[213]
Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art.
[214]
The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities.
[211]
Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.
[215]
Building materials and methods
Fired bricks
with animal designs from
Comalcalco
. Made from brick since there was a lack of readily available stone, it is unique among major Maya sites.
The Maya built their cities with
Neolithic
technology;
[216]
they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available.
[217]
The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety in the quality of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality.
[216]
Volcanic
tuff
was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed
sandstone
.
[217]
In
Comalcalco
, where suitable stone was not available locally,
[218]
fired bricks
were employed.
[217]
Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco.
[218]
Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.
[216]
Wood was used for beams, and for
lintels
, even in masonry structures.
[219]
Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch.
Adobe
was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.
[218]
Principal construction types
The great cities of the Maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples, palaces, ballcourts,
sacbeob
(causeways), patios and plazas. Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls. The exteriors of most buildings were painted, either in one or multiple colours, or with imagery. Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs.
[220]
Palaces and acropoleis
Terminal Classic palace complex at
Sayil
, in northern
Yucatán
[221]
These complexes were usually located in the site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term
acropolis
, in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported
roof combs
. Rooms often had stone benches for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex.
[222]
Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.
[223]
Palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; some examples are adorned with sculpture.
[224]
Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.
[225]
Pyramids and temples
Temple I
, at
Tikal
, was a funerary temple in honour of king
Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I
.
[226]
Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as
kʼuh nah
, meaning "god's house". Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, and the development of the
corbel arch
allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art. Temple shrines contained one to three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities. Such a deity might be one of the
patron gods
of the city, or a
deified ancestor
.
[227]
In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.
[228]
E-Groups and observatories
The Maya were keen observers of the sun, stars, and planets.
[229]
E-Groups
were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region;
[230]
they take their names from Group E at
Uaxactun
.
[231]
They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the
solstices
and
equinoxes
. The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period.
[230]
The
Lost World
complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built towards the end of the Middle Preclassic.
[232]
Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes.
[229]
E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.
[233]
As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other structures dedicated to observing the movements of celestial bodies.
[229]
Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet
Venus
, and various constellations.
[234]
[230]
The
Caracol
structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes.
[229]
Triadic pyramids
Model of a
triadic pyramid

Caracol
,
Belize
Triadic pyramids
first appeared in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal.
[235]
The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform.
[236]
No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes.
[237]
The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic.
[238]
Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites.
[239]
At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature.
[240]
At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures.
[241]
Examples of the triadic form are even known from
Dzibilchaltun
in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Qʼumarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala.
[242]
The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built;
[237]
it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol,
Seibal
,
Nakum
, Tikal and Palenque.
[243]
The Qʼumarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period.
[244]
The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to
Maya mythology
.
[245]
Ballcourts
Postclassic

Zaculeu
, in the
Guatemalan Highlands
The
Great Ballcourt
of
Chichen Itza
The
ballcourt
is a distinctive pan-Mesoamerican form of architecture. Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period,
[246]
the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatán, during the Middle Preclassic.
[247]
By the time of Spanish contact, ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands, at cities such as Qʼumarkaj and Iximche.
[246]
Throughout Maya history, ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an ɪ shape, with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones.
[248]
The central playing area usually measures between 20 and 30 metres (66 and 98 ft) long, and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to 3 or 4 metres (9.8 or 13.1 ft) high.
[249]
The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators.
[250]
The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza is the largest in Mesoamerica, measuring 83 metres (272 ft) long by 30 metres (98 ft) wide, with walls standing 8.2 metres (27 ft) high.
[251]
Regional architectural styles
Although Maya cities shared many common features, there was considerable variation in architectural style.
[252]
Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles.
[253]
Central Petén
The central Petén style of architecture is modelled after the great city of Tikal. The style is characterised by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods.
[253]
One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I.
[254]
Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include
Altun Ha
, Calakmul,
Holmul
,
Ixkun
, Nakum, Naranjo, and
Yaxhá
.
[255]
Puuc
The exemplar of Puuc-style architecture is Uxmal. The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula.
[253]
Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches;
[256]
this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god
Chaac
and the
Principal Bird Deity
. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland
Oaxaca
, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.
[257]
Chenes
Elaborate Chenes-style façade at
Hochob
False pyramids adorn the façade of a
Río Bec
palace.
The Chenes style is very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region. It featured fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures. Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm.
[258]
Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels.
[259]
The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula.
[258]
Examples of Chenes sites include
Dzibilnocac
,
Hochob
,
Santa Rosa Xtampak
, and
Tabasqueño
.
[259]
Río Bec
The
Río Bec
style forms a sub-region of the Chenes style,
[258]
and also features elements of the Central Petén style, such as prominent roof combs.
[260]
Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways and false doors.
[261]
These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function. Such false towers are only found in the Río Bec region.
[258]
Río Bec sites include
Chicanná
,
Hormiguero
, and
Xpuhil
.
[260]
Usumacinta
The Usumacinta style developed in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than
corbel vaulting
. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.
[253]
Language
Main article:
Mayan languages
Map of
Mayan language
migration routes
Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke a single language, dubbed
proto-Mayan
by linguists.
[262]
Linguistic analysis of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary suggests that the original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive.
[263]
Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family, including
Huastecan
,
Greater Kʼicheʼan
,
Greater Qʼanjobalan
,
Mamean
, Tzʼeltalan-Chʼolan, and
Yucatecan
.
[3]
These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times.
[264]
The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as
Chʼolan
;
[265]
Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, or related to, Chʼolan.
[266]
The use of Chʼolan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace - it may have been equivalent to
Medieval Latin
as a
ritual
or
prestige language
.
[267]
Classic Chʼolan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade.
[268]
By the Postclassic period,
Yucatec
was also being written in Maya codices alongside Chʼolan.

The Maya writing system is one of the outstanding achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas.
[271]
It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica.
[272]
The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300-200 BC, in the Petén Basin.
[273]
However, this is preceded by several other
Mesoamerican writing systems
, such as the
Epi-Olmec
and
Zapotec scripts
. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century.
[274]
Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem.
[275]
By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalised and consistent writing system.
[276]
The
Catholic Church
and colonial officials, notably
Bishop Diego de Landa
, destroyed Maya texts wherever they found them, and with them the knowledge of Maya writing, but by chance four uncontested
pre-Columbian books
dated to the Postclassic period have been preserved. These are known as the
Madrid Codex
, the
Dresden Codex
, the
Paris Codex
and the
Maya Codex of Mexico
(previously known as the
Grolier Codex
, which was of disputed authenticity until 2018).
[277]
[278]
Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments, rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices; these tantalizing remains are, however, too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived, most of the organic material having decayed.
[279]
In reference to the few extant Maya writings,
Michael D. Coe
stated:
[O]ur knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture, for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded, only four have survived to modern times (as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to be based upon three prayer books and 'Pilgrim's Progress').

Most surviving pre-Columbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites, such as stelae, or on ceramics vessels. Other media include the aforementioned codices, stucco façades, frescoes, wooden lintels, cave walls, and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials, including bone, shell, obsidian, and jade.

Writing system
Main article:
Maya script
The Maya word
Bʼalam
("
jaguar
") written twice in the Maya script. The first glyph writes the word logographicaly with the jaguar head standing for the entire word. The second glyph block writes the word phonetically using the three syllable signs
BA
,
LA
and
MA
.
The Maya writing system (often called
hieroglyphs
from a superficial resemblance to
Ancient Egyptian
writing)
[281]
is a
logosyllabic
writing system, combining a
syllabary
of
phonetic
signs representing syllables with
logogram
representing entire words.
[280]
[282]
Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language.
[283]
At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.
[280]
The Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period.
[284]
In excess of 10,000 individual texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics.
[280]
The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name
amatl
used to produce
codices
.
[285]
[286]
The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, as a result of the impact of the conquest on Maya society.
[287]
The decipherment and recovery of the knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process.
[288]
Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with
numbers
, the Maya calendar, and astronomy.
[289]
Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter.
[290]
By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.
[291]
[292]
Logosyllabic script
Reading order of
Maya hieroglyphic text
, consisting of twelve glyph blocks arranged in two double columns
The basic unit of Maya logosyllabic text is the glyph block, which transcribes a word or phrase. The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified. C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.
[293]
Although Mayan text may be laid out in varying manners, generally it is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column (C1). Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.
[293]
Individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements. These consist of the main sign, and any affixes. Main signs represent the major element of the block, and may be a
noun
,
verb
,
adverb
,
adjective
, or
phonetic sign
. Some main signs are abstract, some are pictures of the object they represent, and others are "head variants", personifications of the word they represent. Affixes are smaller rectangular elements, usually attached to a main sign, although a block may be composed entirely of affixes. Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements, including nouns, verbs, verbal suffixes, prepositions, and pronouns. Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign. Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements.

Although the archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair.
[286]
A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell.
[295]
Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and
mortars and pestles
.
[142]
Scribes and literacy
Commoners were illiterate; scribes were drawn from the elite. It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write, although at least some
women
could, since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art.
[296]
Maya scribes were called
aj tzʼib
, meaning "one who writes or paints".
[297]
There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write.
[298]
Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record; Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I, king of Tikal, was interred with his paint pot. Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements. A palace at Copán has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes; it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots.
[299]
Although not much is known about Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on ceramics and on stone sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.

Maya numerals
In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) system.
[301]
The bar-and-dot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC;
[302]
the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero.
[303]
This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide,
[304]
although it may have been later than the
Babylonian system
.
[305]
The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD.
[306]
In its earliest uses, the zero served as a
place holder
, indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count. This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation,
[307]
and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years, until the writing system was extinguished by the Spanish.
[308]
The basic number system consists of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five.
[309]
By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used.
[310]
The Maya numerals from 0 to 19 used repetitions of these symbols.
[309]
The value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4×1 + 4×20 + 2×400 = 884. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers.
[301]
Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.
[311]
Calendar
Main articles:
Maya calendar
and
Mesoamerican Long Count calendar
The Maya calendrical system, in common with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was the Maya that developed the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the
Old World
; for example, the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the
Julian year
. The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices.
[312]
The calendar combined a non-repeating
Long Count
with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day
tzolkʼin
,
[313]
the 365-day
haabʼ
,
[314]
and the 52-year
Calendar Round
, resulting from the combination of the
tzolkʼin
with the
haab'
.
[315]
There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god Kʼawiil.
[316]
The basic unit in the Maya calendar was one day, or
kʼin
, and 20
kʼin
grouped to form a
winal
. The next unit, instead of being multiplied by 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was multiplied by 18 in order to provide a rough approximation of the solar year (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a
tun
. Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.

The 260-day
tzolkʼin
provided the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and the foundations of Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, and it may be that the 260-day count is based on the
human gestation period
. This is reinforced by the use of the
tzolkʼin
to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.
[316]
The 365-day
haab
was produced by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day
winal
s, completed by the addition of a 5-day period called the
wayeb
.
[318]
The
wayeb
was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns.
[315]
In a similar way to the
tzʼolkin
, the named
winal
would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), in the case of the shorter
wayeb
period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the
tzʼolkin
had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the
haab
, producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by
Mayanists
as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.
[318]
As with any non-repeating calendar, the Maya measured time from a fixed start point. The Maya set the beginning of their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of
bakʼtun
s, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great
Piktun
cycle consisting of either 20
bakʼtun
s. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the
piktun
cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13
bakʼtun
s, but others used a cycle of 13 + 20
bakʼtun
in the current
piktun
.
[319]
Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.
[320]
A full long count date consisted of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off the number of
bakʼtun
s,
katʼun
s,
tun
s,
winal
s, and
kʼin
s since the start of the current creation. This would be followed by the
tzʼolkin
portion of the Calendar Round date, and after a number of intervening glyphs, the Long Count date would end with the
Haab
portion of the Calendar Round date.
[321]
Correlation of the Long Count calendar
Main article:
Mesoamerican Long Count calendar § Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count
Although the
Calendar Round
is still in use today,
[322]
the Maya started using an abbreviated
Short Count
during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 kʼatuns. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel
[323]
contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the
Gregorian
date of 12 November 1539.
[324]
Epigraphers
Simon Martin
and
Nikolai Grube
argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation.
[325]
The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems with the rest of the Maya region.
[324]
The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period.
[324]
Radiocarbon dating
of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.

J. Eric S. Thompson
, Maya Astronomy:
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
, 1974
[326]
Representation of an
astronomer
from the
Madrid Codex
[327]
The Maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies. This information was used for
divination
, so Maya astronomy was essentially for
astrological
purposes. Although Maya astronomy was mainly used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy, it also had some practical applications, such as providing aid in crop planting and harvesting.
[328]
The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed.
[329]
Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device.
[330]
Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.
[331]
The Maya measured the 584-day Venus cycle with an error of just two hours. Five cycles of Venus equated to eight 365-day
haab
calendrical cycles, and this period was recorded in the codices. The Maya also followed the movements of
Jupiter
,
Mars
and
Mercury
. When Venus rose as the Morning Star, this was associated with the rebirth of the
Maya Hero Twins
.
[332]
For the Maya, the
heliacal rising
of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval.
[330]
Venus was closely associated with warfare, and the hieroglyph meaning "war" incorporated the glyph-element symbolizing the planet.
[333]
Sight-lines through the windows of the Caracol building at
Chichen Itza
align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus' path.
[330]
Maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with the
heliacal
or cosmical rising of Venus, and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions.
[333]
Solar and lunar eclipses were considered to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the
Dresden Codex
, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the
kʼin
("day") hieroglyph.
[334]
Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.
[333]
Religion and mythology
Main articles:
Maya religion
and
Maya mythology
In common with the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices.
[335]
At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm.
[336]
The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were
shamans
.
[337]
Maya ritual included the use of
hallucinogens
for
chilan
, oracular priests. Visions for the
chilan
were likely facilitated by consumption of
water lilies
, which are hallucinogenic in high doses.
[338]
As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into
religious cults
that justified their right to rule.
[335]
In the Late Preclassic,
[339]
this process culminated in the institution of the divine king, the
kʼuhul ajaw,
endowed with ultimate political and religious power.
[337]
The Maya viewed the cosmos as highly structured. There were thirteen levels in the heavens and nine in the underworld, with the mortal world in between. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours.
[340]
Maya households interred their dead underneath the floors, with offerings appropriate to the social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasised, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.
[336]
Belief in supernatural forces pervaded Maya life, from the simplest day-to-day activities such as cooking, to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible and invisible.
[341]
The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning,
music
, ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.
[342]
Archaeologists painstakingly reconstruct these ritual practices and beliefs using several techniques. One important, though incomplete, resource is physical evidence, such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials with their associated
funerary offerings
.
[343]
Maya art, architecture, and writing are another resource, and these can be combined with
ethnographic
sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.
[341]
Human sacrifice
Main article:
Human sacrifice in Maya culture
Relief sculpture of a decapitated
ballplayer
, adorning the
Great Ballcourt

Chichen Itza
Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the
sacrifice
of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.
[344]
Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler, perhaps in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the death gods.
[344]
In AD 738, the
vassal
king Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil of Copán and a few days later ritually decapitated him.
[56]
Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled.
[345]
Another myth associated with decapitation was that of the Hero Twins recounted in the
Popol Vuh
: playing a ballgame against the gods of the underworld, the heroes achieved victory, but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents.
[346]
[344]
During the Postclassic period, the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the rites of the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico;
[344]
this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid.
[347]
In one ritual, the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet, and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life.
[347]
Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.
[348]

The Maya world was populated by a great variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of the sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate.
[350]
The Maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmology.
[351]
The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.
[340]
Itzamna
was the creator god, but he also embodied the cosmos, and was simultaneously a
sun god
;
[340]
Kʼinich Ahau, the day sun, was one of his aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with Kʼinich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the
Night Jaguar
, representing the sun in its journey through the underworld.
[352]
The four
Pawatuns
supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the
Bacabs
performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood.
[353]
The four Chaacs were
storm gods
, controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains.
[354]
The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms.
[353]
Other important deities included the
moon goddess
, the maize god, and the Hero Twins.
[355]
The
Popol Vuh
was written in the Latin script in early colonial times, and was probably transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown Kʼicheʼ Maya nobleman.
[356]
It is one of the most outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas.
[297]
The
Popul Vuh
recounts the
mythical creation
of the world, the legend of the Hero Twins, and the history of the Postclassic Kʼicheʼ kingdom.
[356]
Deities recorded in the
Popul Vuh
include
Hun Hunahpu
, believed by some to be the Kʼicheʼ maize god,
[357]
and a triad of deities led by the Kʼicheʼ patron
Tohil
, and also including the moon goddess
Awilix
, and the mountain god
Jacawitz
.
[358]
In common with other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped
feathered serpent deities
. Such worship was rare during the Classic period,
[359]
but by the Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was
Kukulkan
,
[360]
among the Kʼicheʼ it was
Qʼuqʼumatz
.
[361]
Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent,
Waxaklahun Ubah Kan
, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the
Vision Serpent
of Classic Maya art.
[362]
Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the
Quetzalcoatl
cult of central Mexico.
[363]
Likewise, Qʼuqʼumatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.
[364]
Agriculture
Main article:
Maya cuisine
See also:
Agriculture in Mesoamerica
Maize
was a
staple
of the
Maya diet
.
The ancient Maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production. It was believed that
shifting cultivation
(swidden) agriculture provided most of their food,
[365]
but it is now thought that permanent
raised fields
,
terracing
, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas.
[366]
Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs.
[367]
Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times,
[368]
and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize,
manioc
,
sunflower seeds
, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.
[369]
The basic staples of the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At
Joya de Cerén
, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and
tomatoes
. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed
chocolate beverages
.
[370]
Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.
[371]
The Maya had few domestic animals;
dogs
were domesticated by 3000 BC, and the
Muscovy duck
by the Late Postclassic.
[372]
Ocellated turkeys
were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded up in the wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.
[373]
Maya sites
See also:
List of Maya sites
There are hundreds of Maya sites spread across five countries: Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.
[374]
The six sites with particularly outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras. Other important, but difficult to reach, sites include Calakmul and El Mirador. The principal sites in the Puuc region, after Uxmal, are
Kabah
,
Labna
, and Sayil. In the east of the Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of
Tulum
.
[375]
The Río Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include
Becan
, Chicanná,
Kohunlich
, and Xpuhil. The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas, other than Palenque and Yaxchilan, are Bonampak and Toniná. In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche, Kaminaljuyu,
Mixco Viejo
, and Qʼumarkaj (also known as Utatlán).
[376]
In the northern Petén lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites, though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult. Some of the Petén sites are Dos Pilas, Seibal, and Uaxactún.
[377]
Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha, Caracol, and
Xunantunich
.

The

is a 42-acre (17 ha)
zoo
in
Queen Kapiʻolani Park
in
Honolulu
,
Hawaiʻi
. It is the only zoo in the United States to be established by grants made by a
sovereign monarch
and is built on part of the 300-acre (121 ha) royal
Queen Kapiʻolani Park
. The Honolulu Zoo features over 1,230 animals in specially designed habitats.
Over 601,510 people visit the zoo annually. The zoo is administered by the City & County of Honolulu through the Department of Enterprise Services. Its support agency, the Honolulu Zoo Society (HZS), provides program services for the zoo.

The zoo's accredited membership of the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums
(AZA) was dropped in 2016 but reinstated in 2020.

Queen Kapi‘olani Park
[
edit
]
In 1876, King
Kalākaua
made royal lands near the slopes of
Lē‘ahi
available for the establishment of a grand public park for the people of his
kingdom
. Two hundred subscribers to the king's project formed the Kapiʻolani Park Association for the purpose of pursuing the mission. In 1877, the marshes, ponds and lagoons in the area were beautified, and it was opened as Queen Kapiʻolani Park in honor of
Queen Kapiʻolani
, wife of Kalākaua.
Even as a public park, King Kalākaua continued using the park as a place for his personal collection of exotic birds and horses. The park brought more exotic animals as it staged the
Kamehameha Day
celebrations and various carnivals and fairs. In 1896, the City & County of Honolulu assumed control of Queen Kapiʻolani Park.
History
[
edit
]
A secretary bird, one of the many birds featured at the zoo
In 1914, the City & County of Honolulu appointed Ben Hollinger to be its Administrator of Parks and Recreation, and Queen Kapiʻolani Park came under his control. Hollinger maintained a fascination with animals and began collecting them to showcase at the park in Waikīkī. The park became home for a
monkey
, a
sun bear
and several
lion
cubs. In 1916, a steamship on its way from
Australia
to
Canada
pulled into port at
Honolulu Harbor
. On board was an
African elephant
named Daisy. Hollinger pleaded with the City & County of Honolulu to purchase the elephant, which they did. With the acquisition of the elephant, from live animal trader
Ellis S. Joseph
, Honolulu officially had a zoo. Daisy entertained visitors at the park until 1933, when Daisy was killed by
Honolulu Police Department
officers after she trampled her trainer, George Conradt, to death.
During the
Great Depression
, the Honolulu Zoo was almost shut down for lack of finances. Even through the difficulty, it expanded its collection on November 29, 1949, with the purchase of an elephant, a
Bactrian camel
,
sea lions
, several
bird
species,
spider monkeys
and a
tortoise
. The Honolulu Zoo continued to operate in disrepair.

In 1974, the Honolulu Zoo accepted a donation of a
camel
, an
elephant
,
chimpanzees
and
deer
. These donations renewed Honolulu's enthusiasm to revive their zoo. The City & County of Honolulu approved a master plan that determined the boundaries of the present 42-acre (17 ha) site at the north end of Queen Kapiʻolani Park. The animal collection, increased by purchase, trade and donations, was housed in newly constructed facilities, some of which still provide foundations for newer exhibits. The facility designs were influenced by the exhibits of the
San Diego Zoo
in
California
.
The Honolulu Zoo experienced another revival of enthusiasm in the 1990s as the exhibits were redesigned to feature more natural settings for the animals on display.

Reception
[
edit
]
On
Rotten Tomatoes
the film has an approval rating of 69% based on reviews from 13 critics.
[3]
Dennis Harvey in
Variety
found the film "a pleasant if slender affair reminiscent of
Before Sunrise
, with a little
Once
tossed in", that "moves gracefully toward a conclusion that will trigger tears from some viewers, though others may find it a bit too heavy a tragic load for the film to bear."
[4]
Tom Huddleston in
Time Out
, wrote that "A frequent criticism of ultra-low-budget independent movies is that they try to do too much. 'Forget Me Not' may even be guilty of doing too little - but what it does attempt, it largely pulls off" and concluded that "ambitious it ain't, but
Forget Me Not
is a modest, memorable and rather moving slice of DIY cinema."
[1]
Patrick Smith in
The Daily Telegraph
compared the film to
Richard Linklater
's
Before Sunrise
and
Before Sunset
, but found that although it "isn't quite as accomplished", Menzies and O'Reilly
have enough chemistry for the climax to be surprisingly poignant."
[5]
Roger Ebert
concluded that the film resembles Linklater's films, but "moves along too deliberately", and although the ending "conceals an emotional impact, sad and carefully orchestrated...the film isn't very compelling."
[6]
Awards
[
edit
]
The film won Best UK Film and Best Editing at the 2015 London Independent Film Festival
[7]
and the Golden Ace at the Las Vegas Film Festival.

[1]
[2]
Family and education
[
edit
]
Preston was born in
Bournemouth
,
Dorset
, to John Preston, an architectural draughtsman, and Doreen Lane,
[3]
and was introduced to music at an early age. His uncle played the organ at the church that his family attended, and he was inspired to take up the instrument at the age of 5 after hearing a recording of
George Thalben-Ball
.
[1]
He attended
Canford School
in
Wimborne
,
Dorset
, and was also a
chorister
at
King's College, Cambridge
, where he sang as a
treble
.
[3]
He approached the college's music director,
Boris Ord
, for
organ
lessons but was referred to
Hugh McLean
.
[4]
He later studied under
Caleb Henry Trevor
at the
Royal Academy of Music
before returning to King's College as

under
David Willcocks
. He first came to attention when he accompanied the college choir at the service of
Nine Lessons and Carols

[3]
In 2012 he married Elizabeth Hays.
[1]

Westminster Abbey
in London, where Preston served as sub-organist in the 1960s and organist in the 1980s.
Preston was sub-organist of
Westminster Abbey
from 1962 to 1967 and, after a brief period covering for
Peter Hurford
at

Magnificat
and a
Nunc Dimittis
for the same festival.
Preston made over 100 recordings, beginning in the early 1960s.
[3]
His recordings include the complete organ works of
Johann Sebastian Bach

(CD BBC Music Magazine 2010).
He contributed music to the 1975 film

For the Beauty of the Earth
Genre
Hymn
Written
1864
Text
Folliott S. Pierpoint
Based on
Ephesians 5:20
Meter
7.7.7.7.7.7
Melody
"Dix" by
Conrad Kocher
[
de
]
"
For the Beauty of the Earth
" is a
Christian
hymn
by
Folliott S. Pierpoint
(1835-1917).
History
[
edit
]
Pierpoint was 29 at the time he wrote this hymn; he was mesmerized by the beauty of the countryside that surrounded him. It first appeared in 1864 in a book of Eucharistic Hymns and Poems entitled "Lyra Eucharistica, Hymns and Verses on The Holy Communion, Ancient and Modern, with other Poems."
[1]
It was written as a Eucharistic hymn - hence the title of "The Sacrifice of Praise", the refrain "Christ, our God, to Thee we raise, This, our sacrifice of praise", and as is seen throughout the original text of 1864, especially the last two lines which had replaced the Refrain in verse 8. This is how it appears in the 'English Hymnal' of 1933,
[2]
with the two exceptions, that Pierpoint's last two lines which had replaced the Refrain after verse 8, were omitted and the Refrain sung instead, and the first two words of the last line in verse (three) "sinking sense", in common with all other hymnbooks was modified to "linking sense".
[3]
The text was more radically modified by the publishers of "Hymns Ancient and Modern" for the 1916 Hymnbook,
[4]
so it could serve as a general hymn.

tune
most widely used for this hymn is the same tune used for
William Chatterton Dix
's "
As with Gladness Men of Old
," a
Christmas carol
composed five years prior but not released publicly until three years after Pierpont. (Although the tune is known traditionally as "Dix" in deference to William Dix, it was originally composed by
Conrad Kocher
[
de
]
in 1838.)
Recently, one of the most popular tunes to which this hymn is sung is
Lucerna Laudoniæ
by
David Evans ("E.Arthur")
[1874-1948].
[5]
This is the set tune, for example, in The Hymnal 1982 of the Protestant Episcopal Church and Australia's 1999 Together in Song, the first set tune in the Church of Ireland's 2000 Church Hymnal and the Church of Scotland's 2005 Church Hymnary 4th Edition (Moseley the other), and the second set tune in England's 2000 Common Praise.
Other tunes used are: "Warden" by James Turle (1802-1882) - as appeared in the 1916 Hymns A&M Standard, and
England’s Lane
by
Geoffrey Turton Shaw
(1879-1943) as it appeared in the English Hymnal.

Original text of 1864:
For the beauty of the earth,
For the beauty of the skies,
For the Love which from our birth
Over and around us lies:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For the beauty of each hour
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flower,
Sun and moon and stars of light:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For the joy of ear and eye,
For the heart and brain's delight,
For the mystic harmony
Linking sense to sound and sight:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth, and friends above;
For all gentle thoughts and mild:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For each perfect Gift of Thine
To our race so freely given,
Graces human and Divine,
Flowers of earth, and buds of Heaven:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For Thy Bride that evermore
Lifteth holy hands above,
Offering up on every shore
This Pure Sacrifice of Love:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For Thy Martyrs' crown of light,
For Thy Prophets' eagle eye,
For Thy bold Confessors' might,
For the lips of Infancy:
Christ
, our
God
, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.
For Thy Virgins' robes of snow,
For Thy Maiden Mother mild,
For Thyself, with hearts aglow,
Jesu
, Victim undefiled,
Offer we at Thine own Shrine
Thyself, sweet Sacrament Divine.
[6]
NOTE: Some versions of the hymn used by different Christian denominations omit some verses and change the phrase "Christ, our God, to Thee we raise this our sacrifice of praise" to "Lord of all, to Thee we raise This our hymn of grateful praise",
[7]
or "Lord of all, to thee we raise This our grateful psalm of praise" (Book of Common Praise), or "Father, unto thee we raise This our sacrifice of praise" (Songs of Praise). More recent alternatives include "Holy God, to thee we raise This our sacrifice of praise", "God creative, here we raise This our offering of praise", and "Holy Spirit, all our days, We would offer songs of praise". The Unitarian Universalist hymnal,
Singing the Living Tradition
(1993), has "Source of all, to thee we raise this, our hymn of grateful praise."

Lush Life
is an album by
jazz musician
John Coltrane
, released in early 1961 on
Prestige Records
.
[2]
[1]
It was assembled from previously unissued tracks from three recording sessions at
Van Gelder Studio
in
Hackensack, New Jersey
in 1957 and 1958. As Coltrane's profile increased during the 1960s, some years after the end of his Prestige contract, the label used unissued recordings to create new albums without Coltrane's input or approval.

[7]
In a review for
AllMusic
, Lindsay Planer called the album "among John Coltrane's best endeavors on the Prestige label," and praised the title track, stating that "it is rightfully considered as one of Coltrane's unqualified masterworks," and commenting: "Coltrane handles the tune's delicate complexities with infinite style and finesse. Garland similarly sparkles at the 88s, while Byrd's solo offers a bit of a tonal alternative."
[5]
DownBeat
'
s Dave Cantor also singled out the title track for praise, stating that it "punctuates the bandleader's ability to transcend time and place," with Coltrane "display[ing] an ability to synthesize the tune's lyrical content while still personalizing its message."
[8]
Regarding the trio tracks, the authors of
The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings
noted that bassist Earl May "is too anonymous a player to go the extra yard required for this exacting discipline," and warned that "there are unexpected inconsistencies of register and articulation in Coltrane's own performances."
[6]
David Rickert of
All About Jazz
stated that the album "is as good a place as any to start exploring the early days of Trane," and commented: "the record documents Coltrane's rapid growth over a short period of time while also showcasing how great a talent Coltrane was, even at this early stage."
[9]
In an article for
The Absolute Sound
, Wayne Garcia described the album as "consistently fabulous," and remarked: "The sound is exceptionally detailed, present, and airy, with gorgeously rich instrumental tones and textures, excellent dynamic scaling, and a notable lack of groove noise that brings these performances to goose bump-raising life."
[4]
Flophouse Magazine'
s François van de Linde wrote: "Prestige didn't have the decency to consult Coltrane in the matters of organising a record release. However, as both a longtime Coltrane fan and vinyl freak, I'm glad those 'crumbs' of Coltrane saw the light of day in 1961."
[10]
Matt Fripp of
JazzFuel
stated that the album "documents a pivotal point in [Coltrane's] development," and commented: "Whilst it may have been an exercise in money-making from the label... it is still a highly valuable and exciting insight into the career of a jazz great... an essential addition to any Coltrane collection."

The
Toleration Act 1688
(
1 Will. & Mar.
c. 18), also referred to as the
Act of Toleration
,
[3]
was an
Act
of the
Parliament of England
. Passed in the aftermath of the
Glorious Revolution
, it received
royal assent
on 24 May 1689.
[4]
The Act allowed for freedom of worship to
nonconformists
who had pledged to the oaths of
Allegiance
and
Supremacy
and rejected
transubstantiation
, i.e., to
Protestants
who dissented from the
Church of England
such as
Baptists
,
Congregationalists
or
English Presbyterians
, but not to
Roman Catholics
. Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own schoolteachers, so long as they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.
The Act intentionally did not apply to Roman Catholics, Jews,
nontrinitarians
,
[5]
and atheists.
[6]
It continued the existing social and political disabilities for
dissenters
, including their exclusion from holding political offices and also from the universities. Dissenters were required to register their meeting houses and were forbidden from meeting in private homes. Any preachers who dissented had to be licensed.
Between 1772 and 1774,
Edward Pickard
gathered together dissenting ministers, to campaign for the terms of the Toleration Act for dissenting clergy to be modified. Under his leadership, Parliament twice considered bills to modify the law, but both were unsuccessful and it was not until Pickard and many others had ended their efforts that a new attempt was made in 1779.
[7]
The Act was amended in 1779 by substituting belief in Scripture for belief in the
Thirty-Nine Articles
of the Anglican churches, but some penalties on holding property remained. Penalties against
Unitarians
were finally removed in the
Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813
.
Background
[
edit
]
William III. giving his royal assent to the Toleration Act.
During both the
English Commonwealth
and the reign of
Charles II
, nonconforming
dissenters
including
Roman Catholics
, were subject to religious persecution and precluded from holding official office. Following the restoration of Charles II, Anglican leaders debated in correspondence and public sermon the extent to which the Anglican church should allow doctrinal latitude; this debate was related to the corresponding debate on broadening church membership and tolerating dissenters.
[8]
The succession of the Roman Catholic
James II
was challenged on religious grounds prior to his accession in what became known as the
Exclusion Crisis
and after he took the crown in 1686  in the
Monmouth Rebellion
. However, the Tory leadership of the Anglican church initially supported his right to rule based on the theology of active obedience to the monarch. James II sought a repeal of the
Test Acts
, which imposed various civil disabilities on both Catholics and Protestant non-conformists, to broaden his political support and allow for the appointment of Roman Catholics to civilian and military roles. Failing to secure parliamentary support, James II's attempt to dispense with the Test Acts through the 1687 and 1688
Declarations of Indulgence
helped spark the constitutional crises that culminated in the
Glorious Revolution
and the accession of
William
and
Mary
, who became joint sovereigns. A series of Acts of parliament assured a new constitutional settlement of this situation; these include the
Bill of Rights 1689
, the
Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689
, the
Mutiny Act 1689
, the Toleration Act 1688, and later the
Act of Settlement 1701
and the
Act of Union 1707
.
[9]
The historian Kenneth Pearl sees the Act of Toleration as "in many ways a compromise bill. To get nonconformists' (Protestants who were not members of the Church of England) support in the crucial months of 1688".
[9]
Both the
Whig
and
Tory
parties that had rallied around William and Mary had promised nonconformists that such an act would be enacted if the revolution succeeded. James II had himself issued an act of toleration, but nonconformists believed James II's efforts to undermine their civil liberties and circumvent parliament placed the religious liberties provided via the Declarations of Indulgence at risk.
[10]
Catholics and Unitarians were not hunted down after the Act was passed but they still had no right to assemble and pray.
[9]
As there still remained a
Test Act
, non-Anglicans (including all Protestant non-Conformists, Jews, Catholics, and Unitarians) could not sit in Parliament even following the passage of the Toleration Act 1688.
[11]
The Toleration Act of 1712, passed following the
union between Scotland and England
, granted limited toleration, specifically the right to worship for Scottish Episcopalians who prayed for the monarch and used the English
Book of Common Prayer
.
[12]
Unitarians were only granted toleration after the
Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813
;
[11]
prior to that time, denying the Trinity was a capital offence in Scotland.
[11]
The Test Act remained in force until the nineteenth century.
[9]
Influences
[
edit
]
Historians (such as John J. Patrick) see
John Locke
's
A Letter Concerning Toleration
advocating religious toleration (written in 1685 and published in 1689) as "the philosophical foundation for the English Act of Toleration of 1689".
[6]
While Locke had advocated coexistence between the Church of England (the
established church
) and dissenting Protestant denominations (including Congregationalists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Quakers) he had excluded Catholics from toleration - the same policy that the Act of Toleration enacted.
[6]
Implementation in the overseas colonies
[
edit
]
The terms of the Act of Toleration within the English colonies in America were applied either by charter or by acts by the royal governors.
[6]
The ideas of toleration as advocated by Locke (which excluded Roman Catholics) became accepted through most of the colonies, even in the Congregational strongholds within New England which had previously punished or excluded dissenters.
[6]
The colonies of
Pennsylvania
,
Rhode Island
,
Delaware
, and
New Jersey
went further than the Act of Toleration by outlawing the establishment of any church and allowing a greater religious diversity.
[6]
Within the colonies in the year 1700 Roman Catholics were allowed to practise their religion freely only in Rhode Island.
[13]

Later developments
[
edit
]
Toleration of worship was later extended to Protestants who did not believe in Trinitarian doctrine in the
Unitarians Relief Act 1813
. Catholics were allowed to worship under strict conditions through the
Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791
. As time went on, oaths and tests that barred non-conformists and Roman Catholics from holding public offices, keeping schools, and owning land were rescinded by laws such as
Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1778
, the Roman Catholic Charities Act 1832, the Test Abolition Act 1867, the Promissory Oaths Act 1868, the
Promissory Oaths Act 1871
and the
Oaths Act 1978
. The
Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829
allowed followers of that religion to be elected to Parliament and to hold most offices under the Crown, while the
Jews Relief Act 1858
had a similar effect for adherents of Judaism. The Religious Disabilities Act 1846 ended restrictions on Roman Catholics for education, charities, and owning property, although Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham universities were allowed to continue to exclude Roman Catholics until
Universities Tests Act 1871
took effect. By the passage of the
Places of Worship Registration Act 1855
, an optional system of registration for non-Anglican places of worship was passed which gave certain legal and fiscal advantages for those that registered, and "alternative religion was not only lawful, but was often facilitated by the law."

Quasillites
is a
fossil
genus
of
ostracod
from the
Devonian
and
Carboniferous Periods
.
[1]
[2]
Description
[
edit
]
Quasillites
is distinguished from other ostracodes by the presence of a "medial spot" on each valve.
[2]
The surface of each valve is covered in longitudinal, bifurcating ridges, which curve and resemble a
finger print
.
[2]
[3]
The ribs and
spines
on the
carapace
are in front of the posterior margin, and are similar to those of other ostracods such as
Bufina
,
Parabufina
, and
Healdia
.
[4]
In fact, this comparison can also be drawn for all Quasillitids to other Healdiids.
[4]
The muscle scars on each valve is circular in shape, and some specimens have smaller secondary scars.

Knowledge
is a form of
awareness
or familiarity. It is often understood as
awareness of facts
or as
practical skills
, and may also mean
familiarity with objects or situations
. Knowledge of facts, also called
propositional
knowledge, is often defined as
true
belief
that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of
justification
. While there is wide agreement among philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies in philosophy focus on justification. This includes questions like whether justification is needed at all, how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed. These controversies intensified due to a series of
thought experiments by Edmund Gettier
and have provoked various alternative definitions. Some of them deny that justification is necessary and suggest alternative criteria. Others accept that justification is an essential aspect and formulate additional requirements.
Knowledge can be produced in many ways. The most important source of
empirical knowledge
is
perception
, which is the usage of the
senses
. Many theorists also include
introspection
as a source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of one's own
mental states
. Other sources often discussed include
memory
,
rational intuition
,
inference
, and
testimony
. According to
foundationalism
, some of these sources are basic in the sense that they can justify beliefs without depending on other mental states. This claim is rejected by
coherentists
, who contend that a sufficient degree of coherence among all the mental states of the believer is necessary for knowledge. According to infinitism, an infinite chain of beliefs is needed.
Many aspects of knowledge are investigated, and it plays a role in various disciplines. It is the primary subject of the field of
epistemology
, which studies what someone knows, how they come to know it, and what it means to know something. The problem of the
value of knowledge
concerns the question of why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief.
Philosophical skepticism
is the thesis that humans lack any form of knowledge or that knowledge is impossible.
Formal epistemology
studies, among other things, the rules governing how knowledge and related states behave and in what relations they stand to each other.
Science
tries to acquire knowledge using the
scientific method
, which is based on repeatable
experimentation
,
observation
, and
measurement
. Many religions hold that humans should seek knowledge and that God or the divine is the source of knowledge.
Definitions
Main article:
Definitions of knowledge
Numerous definitions of knowledge have been suggested.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Most definitions of knowledge in
analytic philosophy
recognize three basic types. "Knowledge-that", also called propositional knowledge, can be expressed using that-clauses as in "I know that Dave is at home".
[4]
[5]
[6]
"Knowledge-how" (
know-how
) expresses practical
competence
, as in "she knows how to swim". Finally, "
knowledge by acquaintance
" refers to a familiarity with the known object based on previous direct
experience
.
[5]
[7]
[8]
Analytical philosophers usually aim to identify the
essential features
of propositional knowledge in their definitions.
[9]
There is wide, though not universal, agreement among philosophers that knowledge involves a
cognitive
success or an epistemic contact with
reality
, like making a discovery. It is also widely accepted that
propositional
knowledge is a form of true belief.
[10]
[11]
Despite the agreement about these general characteristics of knowledge, its exact definition is disputed. The disagreements relate to the goals and methods within epistemology and other fields. They also concern disputes about the standards of knowledge that people intend to uphold, for example, what degree of certainty is needed. One approach is to focus on knowledge's most salient features in order to give a practically useful definition.
[12]
[5]
Another is to try to provide a theoretically precise definition by listing the conditions that are
individually necessary and jointly sufficient
. The term "analysis of knowledge" (or equivalently, "conception of knowledge" or "theory of knowledge") is often used for this approach.
[1]
[13]
[14]
It can be understood in analogy to how
chemists
analyze a sample by seeking a list of all the chemical elements composing it.
[1]
[15]
[16]
An example of this approach is characterizing knowledge as
justified true belief
(JTB), which is seen by many as the standard definition.
[4]
[17]
Others seek a common core among diverse forms of knowledge, for example, that they all involve some kind of awareness or that they all belong to a special type of successful performance.
[11]
[18]
[19]
[20]
Methodological differences
concern whether scholars base their inquiry on abstract and general intuitions or on concrete and specific cases. These two positions are known as
methodism
and
particularism
.
[21]
[22]
[23]
Another source of disagreement is the role of
ordinary language
in one's inquiry: the weight given to how the term "knowledge" is used in everyday discourse.
[6]
[14]
According to
Ludwig Wittgenstein
, for example, there is no clear-cut definition of knowledge since it is just a cluster of concepts related through
family resemblance
.
[24]
[25]
Different conceptions of the standards of knowledge are also responsible for disagreements. Some epistemologists, like
René Descartes
, hold that knowledge demands very high requirements, like
certainty
, and is therefore quite rare. Others see knowledge as a rather common phenomenon, prevalent in many everyday situations, without excessively high standards.
[1]
[5]
[26]
In analytic philosophy, knowledge is usually seen as a mental state possessed by an individual person. But the term is sometimes used to refer to a characteristic of a group of people as group knowledge, social knowledge, or collective knowledge.
[27]
[28]
In a slightly different sense, it can also mean knowledge stored in documents, as in "knowledge housed in the library"
[29]
[30]
or the
knowledge base
of an
expert system
.
[31]
[32]
The English word
knowledge
is a broad term. It includes various meanings that some other languages distinguish using several words. For example, Latin uses the words
cognitio
and
scientia
for "knowledge" while Spanish uses the words
conocer
and
saber
for "to know".
[11]
In ancient Greek, four important terms for knowledge were used:
epistēmē
(unchanging theoretical knowledge),
technē
(expert technical knowledge),
mētis
(strategic knowledge), and
gnōsis
(personal intellectual knowledge).
[20]
Knowledge is often contrasted with
ignorance
, which is linked to a lack of understanding, education, and true beliefs.
[33]
[34]
[35]
Epistemology, also referred to as the theory of knowledge, is the philosophical discipline studying knowledge. It studies topics like the nature of knowledge and justification, how knowledge arises, and what value it has. Further issues include the different types of knowledge and the extent to which the beliefs of most people amount to knowledge as well as the limits of what can be known.
[36]
[37]
[11]
Justified true belief
See also:
Belief § Justified true belief
, and
Definitions of knowledge § Justified true belief
Knowledge is often defined as justified true belief.
Many philosophers define knowledge as
justified true belief
(JTB). This definition characterizes knowledge through three essential features: as (1) a
belief
that is (2)
true
and (3)
justified
.
[4]
[17]
In the dialogue
Theaetetus
by the
ancient Greek philosopher
Plato
,
Socrates
pondered the distinction between knowledge and true belief but rejected the JTB definition of knowledge.
[38]
[39]
The most widely accepted feature is truth: one can believe something false but one cannot know something false.
[5]
[6]
A few
ordinary language philosophers
have raised doubts that knowledge is a form of belief based on everyday expressions like "I do not believe that; I know it".
[4]
[5]
[40]
Most theorists reject this distinction and explain such expressions through ambiguities of
natural language
.
[4]
[5]
The main controversy surrounding the JTB definition concerns its third feature: justification.
[1]
[4]
[41]
This component is often included because of the impression that some true beliefs are not forms of knowledge. Specifically, this covers cases of
superstition
,
lucky
guesses, or erroneous
reasoning
. The corresponding beliefs may even be true but it seems there is more to knowledge than just being right about something.
[4]
[5]
[14]
The JTB definition solves this problem by identifying proper justification as the additional component needed. This component is absent in the above-mentioned cases. Many philosophers understand justification internalistically (
internalism
): a belief is justified if it is supported by another
mental state
of the person, such as a
sensory experience
, a
memory
, or a second belief. This mental state has to constitute a sufficiently strong
evidence
or reason for the believed claim. Some modern versions modify the JTB definition by using an
externalist
conception of justification instead. This means that justification depends not just on factors internal to the subject but also on external factors. According to reliabilist theories of justification, justified beliefs are produced by a reliable process. According to causal theories, justification requires that the believed fact causes the belief. This is the case, for example, when a bird sits on a tree and a person forms a belief about this fact because they see the bird.
[1]
[4]
[5]
Gettier problem and alternatives
Main article:
Gettier problem
The Gettier problem is motivated by the idea that some justified true beliefs do not amount to knowledge.
The JTB definition came under severe criticism in the 20th century, when
Edmund Gettier
gave a series of counterexamples.
[42]
They purport to present concrete cases of justified true beliefs that fail to constitute knowledge. The reason for their failure is usually a form of epistemic luck: the justification is not relevant to the truth.
[4]
[5]
[41]
In a well-known example, there is a country road with many
barn facades
and only one real barn. The person driving is not aware of this, stops in front of the real barn by a lucky coincidence, and forms the belief that he is in front of a barn. It has been argued that this justified true belief does not constitute knowledge since the person would not have been able to tell the difference without the fortuitous accident.
[43]
[44]
[45]
So even though the belief is justified, it is a lucky coincidence that it is also true.
[1]
The responses to these counterexamples have been diverse. According to some, they show that the JTB definition of knowledge is deeply flawed and that a radical reconceptualization of knowledge is necessary, often by denying justification a role.
[1]
This can happen, for example, by replacing it with reliability or by seeing knowledge as the manifestation of
cognitive virtues
. Another approach is to define it in regard to the cognitive role it plays. For example, one role of knowledge is to provide reasons for thinking something or for doing something.
[11]
Various theorists are diametrically opposed to the radical reconceptualization. They either deny that Gettier cases pose problems or try to solve them by making smaller modifications to how justification is defined. Such approaches result in a minimal modification of the JTB definition.
[1]
Between these two extremes, some philosophers have suggested moderate departures. They agree that the JTB definition includes some correct claims: justified true belief is a necessary condition of knowledge. However, they disagree that it is a sufficient condition. They hold instead that an additional criterion, some feature
X
, is necessary for knowledge. For this reason, they are often referred to as
JTB+X
definitions of knowledge.
[1]
[46]
A closely related approach speaks not of justification but of warrant and defines warrant as justification together with whatever else is necessary to arrive at knowledge.
[4]
[47]
Many candidates for the fourth feature have been suggested. In this regard, knowledge may be defined as justified true belief that does not depend on any false beliefs, that there are no
defeaters
[a]
present, or that the person would not have the belief if it was false.
[14]
[45]
Such and similar definitions are successful at avoiding many of the original Gettier cases. However, they are often undermined by newly conceived counterexamples.
[49]
To avoid all possible cases, it may be necessary to find a criterion that excludes all forms of epistemic luck. It has been argued that such a criterion would set the required standards of knowledge very high: the belief has to be infallible to succeed in all cases.
[5]
[50]
This would mean that very few of our beliefs amount to knowledge, if any.
[5]
[51]
[52]
For example,
Richard Kirkham
suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth.
[53]
There is still very little consensus in the academic discourse as to which of the proposed modifications or reconceptualizations is correct.
[1]
[54]
[11]
Types
A common distinction among types of knowledge is between propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that, and non-propositional knowledge in the form of practical skills or acquaintance.
[5]
[55]
[56]
The distinctions between these major types are usually drawn based on the linguistic formulations used to express them.
[1]
Propositional knowledge
Main article:
Declarative knowledge
Propositional knowledge, also referred to as
descriptive knowledge
, is a form of theoretical knowledge about facts, like knowing that "2 + 2 = 4". It is the paradigmatic type of knowledge in analytic philosophy.
[4]
[5]
[6]
Propositional knowledge is
propositional
in the sense that it involves a relation to a proposition. Since propositions are often expressed through that-clauses, it is also referred to as
knowledge-that
, as in "Akari knows that kangaroos hop".
[5]
[6]
[8]
In this case, Akari stands in the
relation
of knowing to the proposition "kangaroos hop". Closely related types of knowledge are
know-wh
, for example,
knowing who
is coming to dinner and
knowing why
they are coming.
[5]
These expressions are normally understood as types of propositional knowledge since they usually can be paraphrased using a that-clause.
[5]
[6]
It is usually held that the capacity for propositional knowledge is exclusive to relatively sophisticated creatures, such as humans. This is based on the claim that advanced intellectual capacities are needed to believe a proposition that expresses what the world is like.
[57]
Propositional knowledge is either occurrent or dispositional. Occurrent knowledge is knowledge that is active, for example, because a person is currently thinking about it. Dispositional knowledge, on the other hand, is stored in the back of a person's mind without being involved in cognitive processes at the moment. In this regard, it refers to the mere ability to access the relevant information. For example, a person may know for most of their life that cats have
whiskers
. This knowledge is dispositional most of the time. It becomes occurrent when the person actively thinks about the whiskers of cats. A similar classification is often discussed in relation to beliefs as the difference between
occurrent and dispositional beliefs
.
[6]
[58]
[59]
Non-propositional knowledge
Knowing how to ride a bicycle is one form of non-propositional knowledge.
Non-propositional knowledge is knowledge in which no essential relation to a proposition is involved. The two most well-known forms are knowledge-how (know-how or
procedural knowledge
) and knowledge by acquaintance.
[5]
[6]
[7]
The term "know-how" refers to some form of practical ability or skill. It can be defined as having the corresponding competence.
[5]
[57]
Examples include knowing how to ride a bicycle or knowing how to swim. Some of the abilities responsible for know-how may also involve forms of knowledge-that, as in knowing how to prove a
mathematical
theorem, but this is not generally the case.
[11]
Some forms of practical knowledge do not require a highly developed mind, in contrast to propositional knowledge. In this regard, practical knowledge is more common in the animal kingdom. For example, an
ant
knows how to walk even though it presumably lacks a mind sufficiently developed enough to stand in a relation to the corresponding proposition by representing it.
[57]
Knowledge-how is closely related to
tacit knowledge
. Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be fully articulated or explained, in contrast to
explicit knowledge
.
[60]
[61]
Knowledge by acquaintance is familiarity with an individual that results from direct experiential contact with this individual.
[5]
[6]
[8]
This individual can be a person or a regular object. On the linguistic level, it is usually expressed without a that-clause by using using a
direct object
. So when someone claims that they know Wladimir Klitschko personally, they are expressing that they had a certain kind of contact with him and not that they know a certain fact about him. In this regard, it is a relation to a concrete individual and not a relation to a proposition. Knowledge by acquaintance plays a central role in
Bertrand Russell
's epistemology. He contrasts it with knowledge by description, which is a form of propositional knowledge not based on direct perceptual experience.
[62]
[63]
[5]
However, there is some controversy about whether it is possible to acquire knowledge by acquaintance in its pure non-propositional form. In this regard, some theorists, like
Peter D. Klein
, have suggested that it can be understood as one type of propositional knowledge that is only expressed in a grammatically different way.
[4]
Other distinctions
A priori
and
a posteriori
Main article:
A priori and a posteriori
The distinction between
a priori
and
a posteriori
knowledge came to prominence in
Immanuel Kant
's philosophy and is often discussed in the academic literature. To which of these two categories a knowledge attitude belongs depends on the role of experience in its formation and justification.
[6]
[64]
[65]
To know something
a posteriori
means to know it on the basis of experience.
[66]
[67]
For example, to know that it is currently raining or that the baby is crying belongs to
a posteriori
knowledge since it is based on some form of experience, like visual or auditory experience.
[64]
A priori
knowledge, however, is possible without any experience to justify or support the known proposition.
[65]
[68]
Mathematical knowledge, such as that 2 + 2 = 4, is a paradigmatic case of
a priori
knowledge since no empirical investigation is necessary to confirm this fact.
[67]
[68]
The contrast between
a posteriori
and
a priori
knowledge is usually equated with the contrast between empirical and non-empirical knowledge.
[67]
This distinction pertains primarily to knowledge but it can also be applied to propositions or arguments. For example, an
a priori
proposition is a proposition that can be known independently of experience.
[64]
The relevant experience in question is primarily identified with
sensory experience
. However, some non-sensory experiences, like memory and introspection, are often included as well. But some conscious phenomena are excluded in this context. For example, the conscious phenomenon of a rational insight into the solution of a mathematical problem does not make the resulting knowledge
a posteriori
.
[64]
[65]
It is sometimes argued that, in a trivial sense, some form of experience is needed even for
a priori
knowledge: the experience to learn the language in which the claim is expressed. For
a priori
knowledge, this is the only form of experience required. For this reason, knowing that "all bachelors are unmarried" is considered a form of
a priori
knowledge. The reason is that for a person who understands the terms "bachelor" and "unmarried", no further experience is necessary to know that it is true.
[64]
[65]
One difficulty for
a priori
knowledge is to explain how it is possible. It is usually seen as unproblematic that one can come to know things through experience but it is not clear how knowledge is possible without experience. One of the earliest solutions to this problem is due to Plato. He argues that, in the context of
geometry
, the soul already possesses the knowledge and just needs to recollect or remember it to access it again.
[68]
[69]
A similar explanation is given by René Descartes, who holds that
a priori
knowledge exists as
innate knowledge
present in the
mind
of each human.
[68]
A further approach is to posit a special mental faculty responsible for this type of knowledge, often referred to as
rational insight
or
rational intuition
.
[64]
Self-knowledge
Main article:
Self-knowledge (psychology)
In philosophy, "self-knowledge" usually refers to a person's knowledge of their own
sensations
,
thoughts
, beliefs, and other mental states. Many hold that it is a special type of knowledge since it is more direct than knowledge of the external world, which is mediated through the senses. Traditionally, it was often claimed that self-knowledge is indubitable. For example, when someone is in pain, they cannot be wrong about this fact. However, various contemporary theorists reject this position. A closely related issue is to explain how self-knowledge works. Some philosophers, like Russell, understand it as a form of knowledge by acquaintance while others, like John Locke, claim that there is an inner sense that works in analogy to how the external
five senses
work. According to a different view, self-knowledge is indirect. This means that a person has to interpret their internal and external behavior in order to learn about their mental states. It is similar to how one can learn about the
mental states of other people
by interpreting their external behavior.
[70]
[71]
[72]
In a slightly different sense, the term
self-knowledge
can also refer to the knowledge of the
self
as a persisting entity. This entity has
personality traits
,
preferences
, physical attributes, relationships, goals, and
social identities
. This sense of self-knowledge is of particular interest to
psychology
and refers to a person's awareness of their own characteristics.
[73]
[74]
[75]
Self-knowledge is closely related to
self-concept
, the difference being that the self-concept also includes unrealistic aspects of how a person sees themselves. In this regard, self-knowledge is often measured by comparing a person's self-assessment of their character traits with how other people assess this person's traits.
[74]
Situated knowledge
"Situated knowledges" redirects here. For the Donna Haraway essay, see
Situated Knowledges
.
Situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation.
[76]
[77]
It is closely related to practical or tacit knowledge, which is learned and applied in specific circumstances. This especially concerns certain forms of acquiring knowledge, such as
trial and error
or learning from experience.
[78]
In this regard, situated knowledge usually lacks a more explicit structure and is not articulated in terms of universal ideas.
[77]
The term is often used in
feminism
and
postmodernism
to argue that many forms of knowledge are not absolute but depend on the concrete historical, cultural, and linguistic context.
[76]
[77]
Understood in this way, it is frequently used to argue against absolute or universal knowledge claims stated in the scientific discourse.
Donna Haraway
is a prominent defender of this position.
[78]
[79]
One of her arguments is based on the idea that perception is embodied and is not a universal "gaze from nowhere".
[78]
Higher and lower knowledge
Many forms of eastern spirituality and religion distinguish between
higher
and
lower knowledge
. They are also referred to as
para vidya
and
apara vidya
in
Hinduism
or the
two truths doctrine
in
Buddhism
. Lower knowledge is based on the senses and the intellect. In this regard, all forms of empirical and objective knowledge belong to this category.
[80]
[81]
Most of the knowledge needed in one's everyday functioning is lower knowledge. It is about mundane or conventional things that are in tune with common sense. It includes the body of knowledge belonging to the empirical sciences.
[80]
[82]
[83]
Higher knowledge, on the other hand, is understood as knowledge of
God
,
the absolute
, the
true self
, or the
ultimate reality
. It belongs neither to the external world of physical objects nor to the internal world of the experience of emotions and concepts. Many spiritual teachings stress the increased importance, or sometimes even exclusive importance, of higher knowledge in comparison to lower knowledge. This is usually based on the idea that achieving higher knowledge is one of the central steps on the spiritual path. In this regard, higher knowledge is seen as what frees the individual from ignorance, helps them realize God, or liberates them from the cycle of rebirth.
[81]
[82]
This is often combined with the view that lower knowledge is in some way based on a delusion: it belongs to the realm of mere appearances or
Maya
, while higher knowledge manages to view the reality underlying these appearances.
[83]
In the Buddhist tradition, the attainment of higher knowledge or ultimate truth is often linked to seeing the world from the perspective of
sunyata
, i.e. as a form of
emptiness
lacking inherent existence or intrinsic nature.
[80]

Common knowledge
This section is an excerpt from
Common knowledge
.
[
]
Common knowledge
is knowledge that is publicly known by everyone or nearly everyone, usually with reference to the
community
in which the knowledge is referenced.
[86]
Common knowledge can be about a broad range of subjects, such as science,
literature
, history, or
entertainment
.
[86]
Since individuals often have different knowledge bases, common knowledge can vary and may sometimes take large-scale studies to know for certain what is common knowledge amongst large groups of people.
[87]
Often, common knowledge does not need to be
cited.
[88]
Common knowledge is distinct from
general knowledge
.
In broader terms, common knowledge is used to refer to information that an agent would accept as valid, such as information that multiple users may know.
[87]
Assigning something the label of common knowledge requires certain considerations about the involved community, group, society and/or individuals, the time period, and the location.
[86]
Domain knowledge
This section is an excerpt from
Domain knowledge
.
[
]
Domain knowledge
is knowledge of a specific, specialised discipline or field, in contrast to
general
(or domain-independent) knowledge.  The term is often used in reference to a more general discipline—for example, in describing a software engineer who has general knowledge of computer programming as well as domain knowledge about developing programs for a particular industry. People with domain knowledge are often regarded as
specialists or experts
in their field.
Metaknowledge
This section is an excerpt from
Meta-knowledge
.
[
]
Meta-knowledge
or metaknowledge is knowledge about knowledge.
[89]
Some authors divide meta-knowledge into orders:
zero order meta-knowledge
is knowledge whose domain is not knowledge (and hence zero order meta-knowledge is not meta-knowledge
per se
)
first order meta-knowledge
is knowledge whose domain is zero order meta-knowledge
second order meta-knowledge
is knowledge whose domain is first order meta-knowledge

Other authors call zero order meta-knowledge

Meta-knowledge is a fundamental conceptual instrument in such research and scientific domains as,
knowledge engineering
,
knowledge management
, and others dealing with study and operations on knowledge, seen as a unified
object
/entities, abstracted from local conceptualizations and terminologies.
Examples of the first-level individual meta-knowledge are methods of planning, modeling,
tagging
, learning and every modification of a
domain knowledge
. 
Indeed, universal meta-knowledge frameworks have to be valid for the organization of meta-levels of individual meta-knowledge.
Meta-Knowledge may be automatically harvested from electronic publication archives, to reveal patterns in research, relationships between researchers and institutions  and to identify contradictory results.

Sources of knowledge
Sources of knowledge are ways how people come to know things. According to Andrea Kern, they can be understood as rational capacities that are exercised when a person acquires new knowledge.
[92]
Various sources of knowledge are discussed in the academic literature, often in terms of the mental faculties responsible. They include perception, introspection, memory, inference, and testimony. However, not everyone agrees that all of them actually lead to knowledge. Usually,
perception
or observation, i.e. using one of the
senses
, is identified as the most important source of empirical knowledge.
[5]
[6]
[93]
So knowing that the baby is sleeping is observational knowledge if it was caused by a perception of the snoring baby. But this would not be the case if one learned about this fact through a telephone conversation with one's spouse.
Direct realists
explain observational knowledge by holding that perception is a direct contact with the perceived object.
Indirect realists
, on the other hand, contend that this contact happens indirectly: people can only directly perceive
sense data
, which are then interpreted as representing external objects. This contrast affects whether the knowledge of external objects is direct or indirect and may thus have an impact on how certain perceptual knowledge is.
[11]
Introspection
is often seen in analogy to perception as a source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of internal
mental states
. Traditionally, various theorists have ascribed a special epistemic status to introspection by claiming that it is infallible or that there is no introspective difference between appearance and reality. However, this claim has been contested in the contemporary discourse. Critics argue that it may be possible, for example, to mistake an unpleasant itch for a pain or to confuse the experience of a slight ellipse for the experience of a circle.
[11]
Perceptual and introspective knowledge often act as a form of fundamental or basic knowledge. According to some
empiricists
, perceptual knowledge is the only source of basic knowledge and provides the foundation for all other knowledge.
[5]
[6]
Memory is usually identified as another source of knowledge. It differs from perception and introspection in that it is not as independent or basic as they are since it depends on other previous experiences.
[11]
[94]
The faculty of memory retains knowledge acquired in the past and makes it accessible in the present, as when remembering a past event or a friend's phone number.
[95]
[96]
It is generally seen a reliable source of knowledge. But it can be deceptive at times nonetheless, either because the original experience was unreliable or because the memory degraded and does not accurately represent the original experience anymore.
[11]
Knowledge based on perception, introspection, or memory may also give rise to
inferential knowledge
, which comes about when reasoning is applied to draw inferences from another known fact.
[5]
[6]
[11]
In this regard, the perceptual knowledge of a Czech stamp on a postcard may give rise to the inferential knowledge that one's friend is visiting the Czech Republic. According to
rationalists
, some forms of knowledge are completely independent of observation and introspection. They are needed to explain how certain a priori beliefs, like the mathematical belief that 2 + 2 = 4, constitute knowledge. Some theorists, like
Robert Audi
, hold that the faculty of
pure reason
or
rational intuition
is responsible in these cases. This faculty can be used to explain why such general and abstract beliefs amount to knowledge even though there seem to be no sensory perceptions that could justify.
[94]
[97]
However, difficulties in providing a clear account of pure reason or rational intuition have led some empirically minded epistemologists to doubt that they constitute independent sources of knowledge.
[5]
[6]
[11]
A closely related approach is to hold that this type of knowledge is
innate
. According to Plato's theory of recollection, for example, it is accessed through a
special form of remembering
.
[5]
[6]
Testimony is an important source of knowledge for many everyday purposes. The testimony given at a trial is one special case.
Testimony
is often included as an additional source of knowledge. Unlike the other sources, it is not tied to one specific cognitive faculty. Instead, it is based on the idea that one person can come to know a fact because another person talks about this fact. Testimony can happen in numerous ways, like regular speech, a letter, the newspaper, or an online blog. The problem of testimony consists in clarifying under what circumstances and why it is a source of knowledge. A popular response is that it depends on the reliability of the person pronouncing the testimony: only testimony from reliable sources can lead to knowledge.
[11]
[98]
[99]
Structure of knowledge
The structure of knowledge is the way in which the mental states of a person need to be related to each other for knowledge to arise.
[100]
[101]
Most theorists hold that, among other things, an agent has to have good reasons for holding a belief if this belief is to amount to knowledge. So when challenged, the agent may justify their belief by referring to their reason for holding it. In many cases, this reason is itself a belief that may as well be challenged. So when the agent believes that Ford cars are cheaper than BMWs because they believe to have heard this from a reliable source, they may be challenged to justify why they believe that their source is reliable. Whatever support they present may also be challenged.
[4]
[11]
[14]
This threatens to lead to an
infinite regress
since the epistemic status at each step depends on the epistemic status of the previous step.
[102]
[103]
Theories of the structure of knowledge offer responses for how to solve this problem.
[4]
[11]
[14]
Foundationalism, coherentism, and infinitism are theories of the structure of knowledge. The black arrows symbolize how one belief supports another belief.
The three most common theories are
foundationalism
,
coherentism
, and
infinitism
. Foundationalists and coherentists deny the existence of this infinite regress, in contrast to infinitists.
[4]
[11]
[14]
According to foundationalists, some
basic reasons
have their epistemic status independent of other reasons and thereby constitute the endpoint of the regress. Against this view, it has been argued that the concept of "basic reason" is contradictory. This criticism is based on the idea that there should be a reason for why some reasons are basic and others are non-basic. This would imply that "basic" reasons themselves depend on other reasons and are therefore not basic. An additional problem consists in finding plausible candidates for basic reasons.
[4]
[11]
[14]
Coherentists and infinitists avoid these problems by denying the contrast between basic and non-basic reasons. Coherentists argue that there is only a finite number of reasons, which mutually support each other and thereby ensure each other's epistemic status.
[4]
[11]
Their critics contend that this is the fallacy of
circular reasoning
.
[104]
[105]
For example, if belief
b1
supports belief
b2
and belief
b2
supports belief
b1
, the agent has a reason for accepting one belief if they already have the other. However, their mutual support alone is not a good reason for newly accepting both beliefs at once. A closely related issue is that there can be distinct sets of coherent beliefs. Coherentists face the problem of explaining why someone should accept one coherent set rather than another.
[4]
[11]
For infinitists, in contrast to foundationalists and coherentists, there is an infinite number of reasons. This position faces the problem of explaining how human knowledge is possible at all, as it seems that the human mind is limited and cannot possess an infinite number of reasons.
[4]
In their traditional forms, both foundationalists and coherentists face the
Gettier problem
, i.e. that having a reason or justification for a true belief is not sufficient for knowledge in cases where cognitive luck is responsible for the success.
[4]
[106]
Value of knowledge
Los portadores de la antorcha (The Torch-Bearers)
- sculpture by
Anna Hyatt Huntington
symbolizing the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next (
Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain
)
Knowledge may be valuable either because it is useful or because it is good in itself. Knowledge can be useful by helping a person achieve their goals. An example of this form of
instrumental value
is knowledge of a disease, which can be beneficial because it enables a person to identify and treat the disease. Or to reach an important job interview, knowledge of where and when it takes place helps the person arrive there on time.
[107]
[108]
[109]
However, this does not imply that knowledge is always useful. In this regard, many true beliefs about trivial matters have neither positive nor negative value. This concerns, for example, knowing how many grains of sand are on a specific beach or memorizing phone numbers one never intends to call. In a few cases, knowledge may even have a negative value. For example, if a person's life depends on gathering the courage to jump over a ravine, then having a true belief about the involved dangers may hinder the person to do so.
[108]
Besides having instrumental value, knowledge may also have
intrinsic value
. This means that some forms of knowledge are good in themselves even if they do not provide any practical benefits. According to Duncan Pritchard, this applies to forms of knowledge linked to
wisdom
.
[108]
[107]
The value of knowledge is relevant to the field of
education
, specifically to the issue of choosing which knowledge should be passed on to the student.
[107]
A more specific issue in epistemology concerns the question of whether or why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief.
[110]
[109]
There is wide agreement that knowledge is good in some sense but the thesis that knowledge is better than true belief is controversial. An early discussion of this problem is found in Plato's
Meno
in relation to the claim that both knowledge and true belief can successfully guide
action
and, therefore, have apparently the same value. For example, it seems that mere true belief is as effective as knowledge when trying to find the way to
Larissa
.
[109]
[110]
[111]
According to Plato, knowledge is better because it is more stable.
[109]
A further approach is to hold that knowledge gets its additional value from justification. However, if the value in question is understood primarily as an instrumental value, it is not clear in what sense knowledge is better than mere true belief since they are usually equally useful.
[110]
The problem of the value of knowledge is often discussed in relation to
reliabilism
and
virtue epistemology
.
[110]
[109]
[112]
Reliabilism can be defined as the thesis that knowledge is reliably-formed true belief. On this view, it is difficult to explain how a reliable belief-forming process adds additional value.
[110]
According to an analogy by
Linda Zagzebski
, a cup of coffee made by a reliable coffee machine has the same value as an equally good cup of coffee made by an unreliable coffee machine.
[113]
This difficulty in solving the value problem is sometimes used as an argument against reliabilism. Virtue epistemologists see knowledge as the manifestation of cognitive virtues and can thus argue that knowledge has additional value due to its association with virtue. However, not everyone agrees that knowledge actually has additional value over true belief. A similar view is defended by
Jonathan Kvanvig
, who argues that the main epistemic value resides not in knowledge but in
understanding
, which implies grasping how one's beliefs cohere with each other.
[110]
[109]
[114]
Philosophical skepticism
Pyrrho of Elis
was one of the first philosophical skeptics.
Philosophical skepticism
in its strongest form, also referred to as
global skepticism
, is the thesis that humans lack any form of knowledge or that knowledge is impossible. Very few philosophers have explicitly defended this position. However, it has been influential nonetheless, usually in a negative sense: many scholars see it as a serious challenge to any epistemological theory and often try to show how their preferred theory overcomes it.
[4]
[5]
[11]
For example, it is commonly accepted that perceptual experience is a source of knowledge. However, according to the
dream argument
, this is not the case since dreaming provides unreliable information and since the agent could be dreaming without knowing it. Because of this inability to discriminate between dream and perception, it is argued that there is no perceptual knowledge.
[4]
[5]
[6]
A similar often cited
thought experiment
assumes that the agent is actually a
brain in a vat
that is just fed electrical stimuli. Such a brain would have the false impression of having a body and interacting with the external world. The basic argument is the same: since the agent is unable to tell the difference, they do not know that they have a body responsible for reliable perceptions.
[11]
One issue revealed through these thought experiments is the problem of
underdetermination
: that the evidence available is not sufficient to make a rational decision between competing theories. And if two contrary hypotheses explain the appearances equally well, then the agent is not justified in believing one of those hypotheses rather than the other. Based on this premise, the general skeptic has to argue that this is true for all our knowledge, that there is always an alternative and very different explanation.
[11]
Another skeptic argument is based on the idea that human cognition is fallible and therefore lacks absolute certainty. More specific arguments target particular theories of knowledge, such as foundationalism or coherentism, and try to show that their concept of knowledge is deeply flawed.
[4]
[11]
An important argument against global skepticism is that it seems to contradict itself: the claim that there is no knowledge appears to constitute a knowledge-claim itself.
[6]
Other responses come from common sense philosophy and reject global skepticism based on the fact that it contradicts many plausible ordinary beliefs. It is then argued against skepticism by seeing common sense as more reliable than the abstract reasoning cited in favor of skepticism.
[11]
[115]
Less radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge exists within a specific area or discipline, sometimes referred to as
local
or
selective skepticism
.
[5]
[6]
[11]
It is often motivated by the idea that certain phenomena do not accurately represent their subject matter. They may thus lead to false impressions concerning its nature. External world skeptics hold that one can only know about one's own sensory impressions and experiences but not about the external world. This is based on the idea that beliefs about the external world are mediated through
the senses
. The senses are faulty at times and may thus show things that are not really there. This problem is avoided on the level of
sensory impressions
, which are given to the experiencer directly without an intermediary. In this sense, the person may be wrong about seeing a red Ferrari in the street since it might have been a Maserati or a mere light reflection. But they cannot be wrong about having a sensory impression of the color red.
[5]
[6]
[11]
The inverse path is taken by some materialists, who accept the existence of the external physical world but deny the existence of the internal realm of mind and consciousness. One reason for taking this position is the difficulty of explaining how the two realms can exist together.
[14]
Other forms of local skepticism accept scientific knowledge but deny the possibility of moral knowledge, for example, because there is no reliable way to empirically measure whether a moral claim is true or false.
[5]
The issue of the definition and standards of knowledge is central to the question of whether skepticism in its different forms is true. If very high standards are used, for example, that knowledge implies infallibility, then skepticism becomes more plausible. In this case, the skeptic only has to show that no belief is absolutely certain; that while the actual belief is true, it could have been false. However, the more these standards are weakened to how the term is used in everyday language, the less plausible skepticism becomes.
[6]
[116]
[11]
For example, such a position is defended in the
pragmatist
epistemology, which sees all beliefs and theories as fallible hypotheses and holds that they may need to be revised as new evidence is acquired.
[117]
[118]
[119]
In various disciplines
Formal epistemology
Formal epistemology
studies knowledge using formal tools, such as mathematics and logic.
[120]
An important issue in this field concerns the epistemic principles of knowledge. These are rules governing how knowledge and related states behave and in what relations they stand to each other. The transparency principle, also referred to as the
luminosity of knowledge
, is an often discussed principle. It states that knowing something implies the second-order knowledge that one knows it. This principle implies that if Heike knows that today is Monday, then she also knows that she knows that today is Monday.
[11]
[121]
[122]
Other commonly discussed principles are the
conjunction principle
, the
closure principle
, and the
evidence transfer principle
. For example, the conjunction principle states that having two justified beliefs in two separate propositions implies that the agent is also justified in believing the
conjunction
of these two propositions. In this regard, if Bob knows that dogs are animals and he also knows that cats are animals, then he knows the conjunction of these two propositions, i.e. he knows that dogs and cats are animals.
[4]
Science
Main article:
Philosophy of science
The scientific approach is usually regarded as an exemplary process for how to gain knowledge about empirical facts.
[123]
[124]
Scientific knowledge includes mundane knowledge about easily observable facts, for example,
chemical
knowledge that certain reactants become hot when mixed together. But it also encompasses knowledge of less tangible issues, like claims about the behavior of
genes
,
neutrinos
, and
black holes
.
[125]
A key aspect of most forms of science is that they seek natural laws that explain empirical observations.
[123]
[124]
Scientific knowledge is discovered and tested using the
scientific method
. This method aims to arrive at reliable knowledge by formulating the problem in a clear way and by ensuring that the evidence used to support or refute a specific theory is public, reliable, and replicable. This way, other researchers can repeat the experiments and observations in the initial study to confirm or disconfirm it.
[126]
The scientific method is often analyzed as a series of steps. According to some formulations, it begins with regular observation and data collection. Based on these insights, the scientists then try to find a
hypothesis
that explains the observations. The hypothesis is then tested using a controlled
experiment
to compare whether predictions based on the hypothesis match the actual results. As a last step, the results are interpreted and a conclusion is reached whether and to what degree the findings confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis.
[127]
[128]
[129]
The progress of scientific knowledge is traditionally seen as a gradual and continuous process in which the existing body of knowledge is increased in each step. However, this view has been challenged by some philosophers of science, such as
Thomas Kuhn
. He holds that between phases of incremental progress, there are so-called scientific revolutions in which a
paradigm shift
occurs. According to this view, some basic assumptions are changed due to the paradigm shift. This results in a radically new perspective on the body of scientific knowledge that is incommensurable with the previous outlook.
[130]
[131]
Religion
See also:
Desacralization of knowledge
and
Resacralization of knowledge
Knowledge plays a central role in many
religions
. Knowledge claims about the
existence of God
or
religious doctrines
about how each one should live their lives are found in almost every culture.
[132]
However, such knowledge claims are often controversial and are commonly rejected by
religious skeptics
and
atheists
.
[133]
The
epistemology of religion
is the field of inquiry studying whether
belief in God
and in other religious doctrines is
rational
and amounts to knowledge.
[132]
[134]
One important view in this field is
evidentialism
. It states that belief in religious doctrines is justified if it is supported by sufficient evidence. Suggested examples of evidence for religious doctrines include
religious experiences
such as direct contact with the divine or inner testimony as when hearing God's voice.
[132]
[134]
[135]
However, evidentialists often reject that belief in religious doctrines amount to knowledge based on the claim that there is not sufficient evidence.
[132]
[134]
A famous saying in this regard is due to Bertrand Russell. When asked how he would justify his lack of belief in God when facing his judgment after death, he replied "Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence."
[132]
However, religious teachings about the existence and nature of God are not always seen as knowledge claims by their defenders. Some explicitly state that the proper attitude towards such doctrines is not knowledge but
faith
. This is often combined with the assumption that these doctrines are true but cannot be fully understood by reason or verified through rational inquiry. For this reason, it is claimed that one should accept them even though they do not amount to knowledge.
[133]
Such a view is reflected in a famous saying by Immanuel Kant where he claims that he "had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith."
[136]
Distinct religions often differ from each other concerning the doctrines they proclaim as well as their understanding of the role of knowledge in religious practice.
[137]
[138]
In both the Jewish and the Christian tradition, knowledge plays a role in the
fall of man
in which Adam and Eve were expelled from the
Garden of Eden
. Responsible for this fall was that they ignored God's command and ate from the
tree of knowledge
, which gave them the knowledge of good and evil. This is seen as a rebellion against God since this knowledge belongs to God and it is not for humans to decide what is right or wrong.
[139]
[140]
[141]
In the Christian literature, knowledge is seen as one of the
seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
.
[142]
In
Islam
, "the Knowing" (
al-ʿAlīm
) is one of the
99 names
reflecting distinct attributes of
God
. The
Qur'an
asserts that knowledge comes from God and the acquisition of knowledge is encouraged in the
teachings of Muhammad
.
[143]
[144]
Saraswati
is the goddess of knowledge and the arts in Hinduism.
In Buddhism, knowledge that leads to
liberation
is called
vijjā
. It contrasts with
avijjā
or ignorance, which is understood as the root of all
suffering
. This is often explained in relation to the claim that humans suffer because they crave things that are
impermanent
. The ignorance of the impermanent nature of things is seen as the factor responsible for this craving.
[145]
[146]
[147]
The central goal of Buddhist practice is to stop suffering. This aim is to be achieved by understanding and practicing the teaching known as the
Four Noble Truths
and thereby overcoming ignorance.
[146]
[147]
Knowledge plays a key role in the classical path of Hinduism known as
jñāna yoga
or "path of knowledge". Its aim is to achieve oneness with the divine by fostering an understanding of the self and its relation to
Brahman
or ultimate reality.
[148]
[149]
Anthropology
The
anthropology of knowledge
is a multi-disciplinary field of inquiry.
[150]
[151]
It studies how knowledge is acquired, stored, retrieved, and communicated.
[152]
Special interest is given to how knowledge is reproduced and undergoes changes in relation to social and cultural circumstances.
[150]
In this context, the term
knowledge
is used in a very broad sense, roughly equivalent to terms like
understanding
and
culture
.
[150]
[153]
This means that the forms and reproduction of understanding are studied irrespective of their
truth value
. In epistemology, on the other hand, knowledge is usually restricted to forms of true belief. The main focus in
anthropology
is on
empirical observations
of how people ascribe truth values to meaning contents, like when affirming an assertion, even if these contents are false.
[150]
But it also includes practical components: knowledge is what is employed when interpreting and acting on the world and involves diverse phenomena, such as feelings, embodied skills, information, and concepts. It is used to understand and anticipate events in order to prepare and react accordingly.
[153]
The reproduction of knowledge and its changes often happen through some form of
communication
.
[150]
[152]
This includes face-to-face discussions and online communications as well as seminars and rituals. An important role in this context falls to
institutions
, like university departments or scientific journals in the academic context.
[150]
A
tradition
or
traditional knowledge
may be defined as knowledge that has been reproduced within a
society
or geographic region over several generations. However, societies also respond to external influences, such as other societies. The knowledge claims found in them are interpreted and incorporated in a modified form.
[150]
[153]
[154]
People belonging to the same social group usually understand things and organize knowledge in similar ways to one another. In this regard, social identities play a significant role: people who associate themselves with similar identities, like age-influenced, professional, religious, and ethnic identities, tend to embody similar forms of knowledge. Such identities concern both how a person sees themselves, for example, in terms of the ideals they pursue, as well as how other people see them, such as the expectations they have toward the person.
[150]
[155]
Sociology
Main article:
Sociology of knowledge
The sociology of knowledge is closely related to the anthropology of knowledge.
[156]
[153]
[157]
It is the subfield of
sociology
that studies how thought and society are related to each other. In it, the term "knowledge" is understood in a very wide sense that encompasses many types of mental products. It includes philosophical and political ideas as well as religious and ideological doctrines and can also be applied to folklore, law, and technology. In this regard, knowledge is sometimes treated as a synonym for culture. The sociology of knowledge studies in what sociohistorical circumstances knowledge arises and on what existential conditions it depends. The examined conditions can include physical, demographic, economic, and sociocultural factors. The sociology of knowledge differs from most forms of epistemology since its main focus is on the question of how ideas originate and what consequences they have. In this regard, it does not ask whether the ideas are coherent or correct. An example of a theory in this field is due to
Karl Marx
, who claims that the dominant ideology in a society is a product of and changes with the underlying socioeconomic conditions.
[158]
[159]
[160]
A related view is found in forms of decolonial scholarship that claim that colonial powers are responsible for the
hegemony
of western knowledge systems. They seek a
decolonization of knowledge
to undermine this hegemony.
[161]

Knowledge representation and reasoning
(KRR, KR&R, KR²) is the field of
artificial intelligence
(AI) dedicated to representing
information
about the world in a form that a computer system can use to solve complex tasks such as
diagnosing a medical condition
or
having a dialog in a natural language
. Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology
[163]
about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design
formalisms
that will make complex systems easier to design and build.  Knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from
logic
to automate various kinds of
reasoning
, such as the application of rules or the relations of
sets
and
subsets
.
Examples of knowledge representation formalisms include
semantic nets
,
systems architecture
,
frames
, rules, and
ontologies
. Examples of
automated reasoning
engines include
inference engines
,
theorem provers
, and classifiers.

Anjua Loeak
(died September 2016) was one of the
Iroijlaplap
(or paramount chief) of
Ailinglaplap
, and one of four paramount chiefs in the
Ralik Chain
. Loeak shared his domain with the Iroijlaplap of
Kwajalein
, formerly
Imata Kabua
.
Court case
[
edit
]
After a controversial court case utilizing the westernized American court system, Loeak rose to legitimacy after defeating his relative Melon Loeak who stood in line according to the natural line of patrilineal succession and existing records.
[1]
In the most controversial sense of this case, Iroijlaplap Kabua Kabua testified on Anjua's behalf stating that Marshallese customs only allowed blue blooded royals being the blood son of the male chief to inherit the Iroijlaplap title despite there being an existing precedent with the Loeak's exercising such authority despite not being direct patrilineal descendants. The court case transcripts, particularly the summary judgment of this case, reveal that it was Kabua Kabua's testimony that won the case on behalf of Iroijlaplap Anjua Loeak who was the son ofiroojlaplap
Albert Loeak
. In the most surprising defeat, Melon Loeak, who was deemed the rightful heir by Iroijlaplap Lejolan Kabua, lost his legitimacy due to the prevailing reasoning of the American Trust Territory court system built on the most convincing arguments that neglected mentioning of sensitive issues prevalent in Marshallese customs.
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
[6]
The court transcript revealed that blood was the main criteria despite there being existing evidence from the landowners (Alaps) of Kabinmeto where Albert Loeak grew up revealing that this was literally the pot calling the kettle black as Albert Loeak himself was not the biological son of Iroijlaplap Lobokij Loeak.

This showcased a clear degree of racism even in Marshallese society as the reigns of money have taken over the conscience of the
Marshallese people
particularly in Kwajlein and in Majuro despite the Marshallese Constitution under the Equal Protection Clause, specifically Section 12.2 stating otherwise.
[7]
This is especially true considering the
Compact of Free Association
between the United States and Marshall Islands as its preamble was built on the foundation of Human Rights.

Loeak was a staunch supporter of community-based organizations, such as the Women United Together of the Marshall Islands.

List of episodes
"
Heroic Origins
" is the twelfth and penultimate episode of the
fourth season
of the
NBC
sitcom
Community
, which originally aired on May 2, 2013.
In this episode, Abed pieces together the past timelines of the group to show their lives have always been intertwined.
The episode was written by Steve Basilone, Annie Mebane, and
Maggie Bandur
, and directed by
Victor Nelli Jr.
Plot
[
edit
]
As the group studies for their history final, Abed (
Danny Pudi
) reveals he is actually studying the group's history. Abed believes the group was destined to meet, and had crossed paths before meeting at Greendale. Abed explains in 2008, the group had several coincidental meetings between its members. Annie (
Alison Brie
) and Troy (
Donald Glover
) had attended the same high school; Annie had a crush on Troy, but he didn’t even seem to notice. Troy reveals he actually did notice, as it was her words that made Troy fake an injury so he wouldn’t have to deal with the pressures of being recruited for college football. At a party, Troy was deemed "most likely to succeed," enraging Annie, who was also addicted to prescription drugs at the time. She screamed at Troy that he wouldn't amount to anything, then charged through a glass door (the broken glass popped two balloons, inspiring Magnitude's catch phrase).
Abed and Shirley (
Yvette Nicole Brown
) had both been at the mall one day. Shirley was buying lingerie for a romantic date with her husband, Andre (
Malcolm-Jamal Warner
), while Abed had been standing outside a movie theater to warn moviegoers to not see
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
. Abed accosts two little boys who attempt to go see the movie (who happen to be Shirley's children), causing Abed to get a restraining order from the theater and attend therapy sessions. As Abed is heading to meet the therapist, he spots Annie stealing the doctor's prescription pad, and warns the doctor, and presumably leads to Annie getting caught. In order to pick up her kids, Shirley is forced to leave her husband on a date at the same restaurant where Jeff (
Joel McHale
) and his client, a stripper, are also eating. Jeff had successfully defended her in a case, where Britta (
Gillian Jacobs
) had been staging a rally to support the case. The stripper tells Jeff that she was talking to a married man, implied to be Andre. Having just received news that he is to be disbarred due to a lack of a college degree, Jeff encourages her to pursue him.
In the present, Abed believes himself to be the villain of the group, as he had caused Shirley to leave the restaurant to get her kids and get Annie in trouble for drugs. Jeff, however, believes he is responsible after encouraging the stripper to have an affair with Andre. The group then disbands, feeling awkward about their past meetings. Later, the group all independently meet up at the same place for frozen yogurt. Jeff realizes that perhaps it was fate they all met, and the group then realizes they all decided in this very place that they would attend Greendale. Chang (
Ken Jeong
) had been passing out fliers for Greendale that day, and the group had also observed an old man (implied to be Pierce Hawthorne (
Chevy Chase
)) break a frozen yogurt machine and then fake a heart attack.
Meanwhile, Chang, who is still faking his amnesia and secretly working with the dean of City College, offers to mail an envelope from Dean Pelton (
Jim Rash
) containing the lease renewal for the college. Chang initially plans to steal the envelope, but Abed meets with him later, telling him he is the reason the group had all attended Greendale, and deserves to be one of them. Chang is touched, and decides to join the group and mails the envelope. He later calls Steven Spreck (
Jordan Black
), the dean of City College, telling him he is out, but the dean decides to switch to "Plan B", and laughs maniacally while viewing a blueprint of a giant robot spider.
Continuity
[
edit
]
During the flashback of the group independently being at the mall for frozen yogurt, the song "
Don't You (Forget About Me)
" by
Simple Minds
can be heard in the background. This song was featured in the
pilot episode
of the series which was dedicated to
John Hughes
, the director of the film
The Breakfast Club
, for which the song was the main anthem.
Early in the episode, Abed asks Britta if she has ever taken photos of her feet and put them on the internet for money. Britta replies "No" in a laughing and defensive way, implying that she actually had done so. In the pilot episode, Britta tells Jeff she did "a little foot modeling." (Counting the episodes "Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism" and "Intro to Felt Surrogacy," it is the fourth indirect reference to foot fetishism of the series.)
Reception
[
edit
]
In its original broadcast, "Heroic Origins" was seen by 2.67 million American viewers and achieved a 1.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic. It placed fourth in overall viewership in its time slot, behind
The Big Bang Theory
,
American Idol
, and
Wife Swap
.

Grose Vale
is a
suburb
of
Sydney
, in the state of
New South Wales
,
Australia
. It is located in the
City of Hawkesbury
.  It was previously known as South Kurrajong. Many historic properties are located in Grose Vale including "Lemon Forest" originally owned by the Lamrock family as well as a number of homes owned by the Dunston and Ezzy families.
Population
[
edit
]
In the
2016 census
, Grose Vale recorded a population of 1,265 people. 83.0% of people were born in Australia and 90.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion in Grose Vale were Catholic 31.4%, Anglican 25.7% and No Religion 21.6%,
[1]
Geography
[
edit
]
The suburb consists of mostly semi-rural properties around 5 to 10 acres (40,000 m
2
) in size.  Entry into the suburb is via Grose Vale Road running from Grose Wold to the East, and the village of Kurrajong to the North.
Amenities
[
edit
]
The suburb has no footpaths and only sparse street-lighting.
The parts of Grose Vale nearest Kurrajong have town water and/or sewer lines.  The majority of residents use tank water, either from rainfall or trucked in using tankers.  Waste is disposed of using septic tanks and absorption trenches.
Amenities are provided at the junction of Grose Vale Road and Grose Wold Road (West) in the form of a small general store and petrol station (gas station), a post office, a hairdresser, a bus-stop and a public telephone. NB: as of April 2013, the general store and gas station were closed  and the premises on the market.  The new owners have completely redeveloped the store and installed new petrol tanks and established a brand new petrol station that now trades as Lucky 7. The new store has also integrated the post office inside. The nearest grocery stores are now approximately a 7-minute-drive away at either Kurrajong (small family-owned supermarket) or North Richmond (Aldi and Coles)
Grose Vale has a government primary (elementary) school, Grose View Public School, a community centre hall, a rural fire station located on Cabbage Tree Road, and is served by a Cub and Scout Pack.
Telephone and power lines run above ground, and due to the hilly somewhat-exposed terrain and number of trees, power failures are not uncommon during stormy weather.  Broadband internet supply uses ADSL2, with the Telstra telephone exchange located near the general store.
Subscription television is by satellite only.  Cable television does not yet run to Grose Vale.
Wildlife
[
edit
]
The
Blue Mountains
national park opens to the south and west of the suburb, and brings many forms of native fauna to the residents.  Wallabies are common, as are the
Australian king parrot
, the
kookaburra
, the
rosella
, the
rainbow lorikeet
, the bellbird, the
galah
, and the
cockatoo
.
Climate
[
edit
]
Winters can drop to below zero (32 °F) but this is not common.  Daytime summer temperatures can reach into the mid 40s (110 + F) and if coupled with low humidity and a strong NW wind the suburb is exposed to an extreme risk of
bushfires
.

Remko Jan Hendrik Scha
(15 September 1945 - 9 November 2015)
[1]
was a
professor
of
computational linguistics
at the faculty of humanities and
Institute for Logic, Language and Computation
at the
University of Amsterdam
. He made important contributions to semantics, in particular the treatment of plurals, and to discourse analysis, and laid the foundations for what became an important research paradigm in computational linguistics, Data Oriented Parsing.
[2]
He was a
composer
and performer of
algorithmic art
.
[3]
He made recordings of music which has been generated by motor-driven machines. One notable example of this type of music is his 1982 album of
electric guitar
music, "Machine Guitars", on which all guitars are played by
saber saws
without human intervention, except for one in which the guitar is played by a rotating
wire brush
, again with no human intervention. Recorded in Eindhoven and New York, it was described by Byron Coley in
The Wire
231 as one of "the definitive modern NYC guitar work[s]", and its influence can be heard in the music of Eli Keszler, Alan Courtis and many more. Performances by The Machines took place in Amsterdam, Brussels, London, Berlin, New York, San Francisco. The most recent performance was in Leiden (2015).
[4]
Scha had a longrunning involvement in the arts in the Netherlands. Alongside
Paul Panhuysen
he founded
Het Apollohuis
, a former cigar factory in Eindhoven which became a space for performance, art and music in 1980. It played host to performers such as Ellen Fullman, whose
The Long String Instrument
LP was recorded there in the venue's first year. Scha also founded the Institute of Artificial Art Amsterdam. In IAAA he brought together machines, computers, algorithms and human persons to work together toward the complete automatization of art production. With IAAA collaborators Remko developed machines and algorithms for the production of random artworks in a range of fields: music, drawing, architecture, graphical and product design, facial expressions.
[5]
On the radicalart.info site
[6]
he created an extensive analytical anthology of anti-art and meta-art that lists and discusses the art historical sources that informed his artistic views. Maciunas Ensemble was an ensemble founded in 1968 by Paul Panhuysen, Remko Scha and
Jan van Riet
. Scha left the ensemble in 1982. In 2012 a set of eleven CDs was released of the period Scha was involved in the ensemble.

Signature
John Smith
(baptized 6 January 1580 - 21 June 1631) was an English soldier, explorer, colonial governor, admiral of
New England
, and author. He played an important role in the establishment of the colony at
Jamestown, Virginia
, the first permanent
English settlement
in North America, in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the
Virginia Colony
between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the
Chesapeake Bay
, during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to
Sigismund Báthory
, Prince of
Transylvania
, and his friend
Mózes Székely
.
Jamestown was established on May 14, 1607.
[1]
Smith trained the first settlers to work at farming and fishing, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, "
He that will not work, shall not eat
", alluding to
2 Thessalonians 3:10
.
[2]
Harsh weather, a lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and attacks from
Native Americans
almost destroyed the colony. With Smith's leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.
Smith's books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the
New World
. Having named the region of New England, he stated: "Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land. ...If he have nothing but his hands, he may...by industries quickly grow rich."
[3]
Smith died in London in 1631.
Early life
[
edit
]
Window in St Helena's Church,
Willoughby
, displaying Smith's coat of arms
Smith's exact birth date is unclear. He was baptized on 6 January 1580 at
Willoughby
,
[4]
near
Alford, Lincolnshire
, where his parents rented a farm from
Lord Willoughby
. He claimed descent from the ancient Smith family of
Cuerdley
, Lancashire,
[5]
and was educated at
King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth
, from 1592 to 1595.
[6]
Smith set off to sea at age 16 after his father died. He served as a mercenary in the army of
Henry IV of France
against the Spaniards, fighting for
Dutch independence
from King
Philip II of Spain
. He then went to the Mediterranean where he engaged in trade and piracy, and later fought against the
Ottoman Turks
in the
Long Turkish War
. He was promoted to a cavalry captain while fighting for the Austrian
Habsburgs
in Hungary in the campaign of
Michael the Brave
in 1600 and 1601. After the death of Michael the Brave, he fought for
Radu Șerban
in
Wallachia
against Ottoman vassal
Ieremia Movilă
.
[7]
Smith reputedly killed and beheaded three Ottoman challengers in single-combat duels, for which he was knighted by the
Prince of Transylvania
and given a horse and a coat of arms showing three Turks' heads.
[8]
However, in 1602 he was wounded in a skirmish with the
Crimean Tatars
, captured, and sold as a slave.
[9]
He claimed that his master was a Turkish nobleman who sent him as a gift to his Greek mistress in Constantinople, Charatza Tragabigzanda, who fell in love with Smith. He then was taken to the
Crimea
, where he escaped from Ottoman lands into
Muscovy
, then on to the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
before travelling through Europe and North Africa, returning to England in 1604.

In Jamestown
[
edit
]
Statue at
Historic Jamestown
In 1606, Smith became involved with the
Virginia Company of London
's plan to
colonize Virginia
for profit, and
King James
had already granted a charter. The expedition set sail on
Discovery
,
Susan Constant
, and
Godspeed
on 20 December 1606. His page was a 12-year-old boy named Samuel Collier.
[2]
During the voyage, Smith was charged with mutiny, and Captain
Christopher Newport
(in charge of the three ships) had planned to execute him. These events happened approximately when the expedition stopped in the
Canary Islands
[10]
[11]
for resupply of water and provisions. Smith was under arrest for most of the trip. However, they landed at
Cape Henry
on 26 April 1607 and unsealed orders from the Virginia Company designating Smith as one of the leaders of the new colony, thus sparing him from the gallows.
[2]
[12]
By the summer of 1607, the colonists were still living in temporary housing. The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain
Edward Maria Wingfield
, president of the council, chose the
Jamestown
site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day, and someone died almost every day due to swampy conditions and widespread disease. By September, more than 60 had died of the 104 who left England.
[13]
In early January 1608, nearly 100 new settlers arrived with Captain Newport on the
First Supply
, but the village was set on fire through carelessness. That winter, the
James River
froze over, and the settlers were forced to live in the burned ruins. During this time, they wasted much of the three months that Newport and his crew were in port loading their ships with iron pyrite (fool's gold). Food supplies ran low, although the Native Americans brought some food, and Smith wrote that "more than half of us died".
[14]
Smith spent the following summer exploring Chesapeake Bay waterways and producing a map that was of great value to Virginia explorers for more than a century.
[14]
In October 1608, Newport brought a second shipment of supplies along with 70 new settlers, including the first women. Some German, Polish, and Slovak craftsmen also arrived,
[15]
[16]
[17]
[18]
but they brought no food supplies. Newport brought a list of counterfeit Virginia Company orders which angered Smith greatly. One of the orders was to crown Indian leader
Powhatan
emperor and give him a fancy bedstead. The Company wanted Smith to pay for Newport's voyage with pitch, tar, sawed boards, soap ashes, and glass.
[13]
After that, Smith tried to obtain food from the local Indians, but it required threats of military force for them to comply.
[13]
Smith discovered that there were those among both the settlers and the Indians who were planning to take his life, and he was warned about the plan by
Pocahontas
. He called a meeting and threatened those who were not working "that he that will not work shall not eat." After that, the situation improved and the settlers worked with more industry.
[19]
[20]
Encounter with the Powhatan tribe
[
edit
]
Inside a longhouse with Chief Powhatan (detail of John Smith map, 1612)
Native Americans led by
Opechancanough
captured Smith in December 1607 while he was seeking food along the
Chickahominy River
, and they took him to meet
Chief Powhatan
(Opechancanough's older brother) at
Werowocomoco
, the main village of the
Powhatan Confederacy
. The village was on the north shore of the
York River
about 15 miles north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the
Pamunkey River
and the
Mattaponi River
at
West Point, Virginia
. Smith was removed to the hunters' camp, where Opechancanough and his men feasted him and otherwise treated him like an honoured guest. Protocol demanded that Opechancanough inform Chief Powhatan of Smith's capture, but the paramount chief also was on a hunt and therefore unreachable. Absent interpreters or any other means of effectively interviewing the Englishman, Opechancanough summoned his seven highest-ranking kwiocosuk, or shamans, and convened an elaborate, three-day divining ritual to determine whether Smith's intentions were friendly. Finding it a good time to leave camp, Opechancanough took Smith and went in search of his brother, at one point visiting the
Rappahannock
tribe
who had been attacked by a European ship captain a few years earlier.
[21]
[22]
In 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and scepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating
Queen Anne
to treat Pocahontas with dignity.
[23]
The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.
[24]
Henry Brooks Adams
attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of "falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times". There is consensus among historians that Smith tended to exaggerate, but his account is consistent with the basic facts of his life.
[25]
Some have suggested that Smith believed that he had been rescued, when he had in fact been involved in a ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe.
[26]
[27]
David A. Price notes in
Love and Hate in Jamestown
that this is purely speculation, since little is known of Powhatan rituals and there is no evidence for any similar rituals among other Native American tribes.
[28]
Smith told a similar story in
True Travels
(1630) of having been rescued by the intervention of a young girl after being captured in 1602 by
Turks
in Hungary.
Karen Kupperman
suggests that he "presented those remembered events from decades earlier" when telling the story of Pocahontas.
[29]
Whatever really happened, the encounter initiated a friendly relationship between the Native Americans and colonists near
Jamestown
. As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.
In 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came.
[30]
Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop. Smith wrote that two Poles rescued him when he was attacked by an Algonquian tribesman.
[31]
Smith's explorations of the Chesapeake Bay
[
edit
]
In the summer of 1608, Smith left Jamestown to explore the
Chesapeake Bay
region and search for badly needed food, covering an estimated 3,000 miles. These explorations are commemorated in the
Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail
, established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend
Matthew Scrivener
as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton
Suffolk
who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.

Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.
[19]
Influx of settlers
[
edit
]
Some of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of "he who works not, eats not". This lasted "till they were near starved indeed", in Smith's words, and they returned home.
[2]
In the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.
[20]
The weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by
Samuel Argall
. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was
sending more supplies and settlers
to Jamestown, along with
Lord De la Warr
to become the new governor.
[20]
John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)
In a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer
Sir Thomas Smith
arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the
Sea Venture
wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir
George Somers
aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the
Deliverance
and
Patience
to take most of the passengers and crew of the
Sea Venture
off Bermuda, with the new governor
Thomas Gates
on board.
[32]
In August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support.
[2]
Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the
Sea Venture
. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.
[2]
Somers returned to Bermuda with the
Patience
to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The
Patience
then sailed for England instead of Virginia, captained by his nephew.
Smith was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion in his canoe, and he sailed to England for treatment in mid-October 1609. He never returned to Virginia.
[2]
Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir
Thomas Dale
continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send.
[33]
New England
[
edit
]
Smith's 1616 Map of New England
In 1614, Smith returned to America in a voyage to the coasts of
Maine
and
Massachusetts Bay
. He named the region "
New England
".
[34]
The commercial purpose was to take whales for fins and oil and to seek out mines of gold or copper, but both of these proved impractical so the voyage turned to collecting fish and furs to defray the expense.
[35]
Most of the crew spent their time fishing, while Smith and eight others took a small boat on a coasting expedition during which he traded rifles for 11,000 beaver skins and 100 each of martins and otters.
[36]
Smith collected a ship's cargo worth of "Furres… traine Oile and Cor-fish" and returned to England. The expedition's second vessel under the command of Thomas Hunt stayed behind and captured a number of Indians as slaves,
[36]
including
Squanto
of the
Patuxet
. Smith was convinced that Hunt's actions were directed at him; by inflaming the local population, Smith said, he could "prevent that intent I had to make a plantation there", keeping the country in "obscuritie" so that Hunt and a few merchants could monopolize it.
[36]
According to Smith, Hunt had taken his maps and notes of the area to defeat's Smith's settlement plans.
[37]
He could not believe that Hunt was driven by greed since there was "little private gaine" to be gotten; Hunt "sold those silly Salvages for Rials of eight."
[38]
Smith published a map in 1616 based on the expedition which was the first to bear the label "New England", though the Indian place names were replaced by the names of English cities at the request of
Prince Charles
.
[39]
The settlers of
Plymouth Colony
adopted the name that Smith gave to that area,
[39]
and other place names on the map survive today, such as the
Charles River
(marked as The River Charles) and
Cape Ann
(Cape Anna).
Title page of
A Description of New England
(1616)
Smith made two attempts in 1614 and 1615 to return to the same coast. On the first trip, a storm dismasted his ship. In the second attempt, he was captured by French pirates off the coast of the
Azores
. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he published an account of his two voyages as
A Description of New England
. He remained in England for the rest of his life.
Smith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control. The people inhabiting the coasts from Maine to Cape Cod had "large corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people", but the French had obtained everything that they had to offer in trade within six weeks.
[40]
This was due to the fact that the French had created a great trading network which they could exploit, and the English had not cultivated these relations. Where once there was inter-tribal warfare, the French had created peace in the name of the fur trade. Former enemies such as the Massachuset and the Abenaki "are all friends, and have each trade with other, so farre as they have society on each others frontiers."
[41]
Smith believed that it was too late to reverse this reality even with diplomacy, and that what was needed was military force. He suggested that English adventurers should rely on his own experience in wars around the world
[42]
and his experience in New England where his few men could engage in "silly encounters" without injury or long term hostility.
[43]
He also compared the experience of the Spaniards in determining how many armed men were necessary to effect Indian compliance.
[44]
Death and burial
[
edit
]
John Smith died on 21 June 1631 in London. He was buried in 1633 in the south aisle of
Saint Sepulchre-without-Newgate Church
, Holborn Viaduct, London. The church is the largest parish church in the City of London, dating from 1137. Captain Smith is commemorated in the south wall of the church by a stained glass window.

Capt. John Smith Monument as it appeared c. 1914, Isles of Shoals
The Captain John Smith Monument currently lies in disrepair off the coast of
New Hampshire
on
Star Island
, part of the
Isles of Shoals
. The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a series of square granite slabs atop one another, with a small granite pillar at the top (see image at right). The pillar featured three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.
[46]
In 1914, the New Hampshire Society of Colonial Wars partially restored and rededicated the monument for the 300th anniversary celebration of his visit.
[47]
The monument had weathered so badly in the harsh coastal winters that the inscription in the granite had worn away.
[48]

Contemporary newspapers reported dedication of "a bronze tablet" honouring Smith, and dedication of the

In 2014, a new monument honouring Smith was dedicated at

, an 18-ton
obelisk
measuring "16 feet 14 inches"—in commemoration of the year 1614; 17 feet 2 inches (5.23 m)—in height.

1624 John Smith's
The Generall Historie of Virginia
The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles
by Capt. John Smith, 1624
Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing
St. George's Town
and related fortifications, including the
Castle Islands Fortifications
Many critics judge Smith's character and credibility as an author based solely on his description of Pocahontas saving his life from the hand of Powhatan. Most of the scepticism results from the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is
A True Relation of Virginia
, submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was
The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles
, which was published in 1624. The publication of letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that the communications must go "directly to the company" because no one was to "write any letter of anything that may discourage others". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing
A True Relation
as an unknown author.
[52]
Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of
The Generall Historie
might have cut out "references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.
[53]
The Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it is missing from
A True Relation
but it does appear in
The Generall Historie
. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that "no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt" about the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth "were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen", including Pocahontas herself.
[54]
Smith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the presumed fate of the
Roanoke Colony
.
Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.

Smith's map of Virginia from
The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles
, 1624
One of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.
[56]
Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from "their ease and humours at home".
[57]
"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading".
[58]
Smith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to "live and succeed in America" in the face of such dangers.
[59]
Additional works
[
edit
]
A Map of Virginia
is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony.
A Map of Virginia
was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, "maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness," promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.
[60]
Many "naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he "lacked a formal education in cartography".
[61]
That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a "master in his chosen fields of experience".
[61]
was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident. The writing style of
The Proceedings
is thought to be better constructed than
A Map of Virginia
.

Beuvry
(
French pronunciation:
[bøvʁi]
) is a
commune
in the
Pas-de-Calais
department in the
Hauts-de-France
region in northern France.
[3]
Geography
[
edit
]
A suburban town immediately southwest of Béthune, 23 miles (37 km) southwest of
Lille
, at the junction of the D945, D72 and N41 roads. Light industry and a little farming have replaced the coal mining of the past.
History
[
edit
]
The town's name comes from
beaver
(in Old French,
bièvre
) and underwent variations on this over the centuries: Berri; Beuvri; Bevery; Bouvry and finally Beuvry.
Meusnier's dirigible built and flown by the Robert brothers from Paris to Beuvry in 1784
On September 19, 1784, the
Robert brothers (Anne-Jean Robert and Marie-Noël Robert)
plus M. Collin-Hullin flew their hydrogen balloon,
La Caroline
, on request of
Philippe III Alexandre, 1st Prince de Ghistelles
for 6 hours 40 minutes, covering 186 km from Paris to Beuvry.
La Caroline
owed its design to the work of professor
Jacques Charles
and
Jean Baptiste Meusnier
and achieved the world's first ever flight over 100 km.
[4]
[5]
In the Ville de Beuvry a stone monument was erected to commemorate the 200th anniversary landing of the brothers in
La Caroline
on September 19, 1784.
[6]
A celebration ball
la ducasse "du Ballon"
is now held at the end of every September.
[6]
The town has been awarded the
Croix de Guerre
twice: after World War I and again, after World War II.
A
coal-mining
town for about 100 years, the last pit closed in the 1960s.
The town was merged with the nearby city of
Béthune
at the end of 1993. However, many of the Beuvrygeois voiced their dissatisfaction with the decision at the time, which resulted in the municipal elections of 1995, petitions in 1995 and 1996 and the creation, in October 1996, of a special commission to give an opinion on draft amendments to the territorial limits of the city of Béthune for the re-creation of a separate town of Beuvry. The municipal election in September 1997 led to a de-merger and Beuvry became an independent full-fledged town again in November 1997.

John Watts Jr.
(August 27, 1749 - September 3, 1836) was an American lawyer and politician from
New York City
who represented
New York
in the
U.S. House of Representatives
.
[1]
Life
[
edit
]
Statue of John Watts
in the
Trinity Church Cemetery
in New York
John Watts was born on August 27, 1749, in
New York City
. He was the son of
John Watts
(1715-1789), a Scottish immigrant from a wealthy family, and Ann DeLancey (1723-1784), a descendant of the
Schuyler family
and
Van Cortlandt family
. His elder brother, Robert Watts (1743-1814), was married to Mary Alexander, the daughter of
Lord Stirling
.  His younger siblings included Anne Watts (1744-1783), who was married to
Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis
(the parents of
Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa
), Susannah Watts (1749-1823), who was married to Phillip Kearney, Mary Nicoll Watts (1751-1815), who was married to
Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet
, Stephen Watts, who was married to Sarah Nugent, and Margaret Watts, who was married to Robert Leake.
[2]
His maternal grandparents were the French born
Etienne de Lancy
(1663-1741), a minor member of the French nobility,
[2]
and Anne van Cortlandt (1676-1724), the third child of
Gertrude Schuyler
(b. 1654) and
Stephanus van Cortlandt
(1643-1700), the
Chief Justice
of the
Province of New York
.
[3]
He completed preparatory studies, graduated with an
A.M.
degree from
King's College
in May 1769, and studied law.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
In 1774, he was appointed the
Recorder of New York City
under Mayor
David Mathews
, and was the last to serve in this role under the English Crown.
[4]
The role included serving as a "mayoral assistant, judge, and in sundry administrative and judicial functions."
[5]
His father, a
Loyalist
, fled the colonies to England during the
Revolutionary War
.  In 1779, his properties, including his "Rose Hill" estate (which is now occupied by
Fordham University
), were seized by the
New York State Legislature
.  Watts and his brother Robert petitioned for the
attainder
to be overturned. They were unable to have it overturned but were allowed to buy back their father's properties.
Post Revolutionary War
[
edit
]
From 1788 to 1789 and again from 1791 to 1793, Watts was a member of the
New York State Assembly
serving as
Speaker of the Assembly
from 1791 to 1793. He was a member of the commission to build
Newgate Prison
in New York City, in use between 1797 and 1829.
In 1793, he was elected as a
Pro-Administration Party
representative to the
3rd United States Congress
succeeding
John Laurance
to represent
New York's 2nd congressional district
. He served in the U.S. Congress from March 4, 1793, until March 3, 1795.  He was defeated in his run for re-election by
Edward Livingston
.
He was a judge of
Westchester County, New York
from 1802 to 1807.
Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum
[
edit
]
In 1831, Watts organized the
Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum
after his friend (who was also his sister Margaret's brother-in-law), John George Leake (1752-1827), died with no children or living siblings.
[6]
Leake and Watts Services is now called
Rising Ground
. Leakes had left his personal property (valued at about $300,000) and real estate (worth an additional $86,000),
[7]
to Watts' son provided he change his name to "Robert Leake."
[8]
While Watts son made the change, he died a few months later, leaving no will.  The real estate was
escheated
to the State because of technical problems of the "will", however, the personal property passed to Watts who used it to found the Orphan Asylum.
[8]
Personal life
[
edit
]
In 1775, Watts married Jane Delancey (1750-1809)
[9]
in a double wedding, along with her sister, Susannah Delancey (1754-1837), who married
Thomas Henry Barclay
.
[10]
The sisters were daughters of Peter DeLancey (who served in the
New York Provincial Assembly
for many years) and Elizabeth Colden (daughter of
Cadwallader Colden
), and granddaughters of
Stephen Delancey
making them first cousins to John.
[11]
Together, John and Jane were the parents of eleven children. His grandson would later write that "Watts was a monument of affliction, in that he had seen his wife, six handsome, gifted, and gallant sons, and four daughters precede him to the grave. One childless daughter survived him and three grandchildren."
[5]
The children included:
[11]
George Watts, a First Lt. and
aide-de-camp
to General
Winfield Scott
from 1814 to 1815.
[11]
Robert J. Watts, a captain in the
41st Infantry
to whom John G. Leake left his extensive properties. Robert inherited Leake's estate but died very soon after.
[5]
John Watts III.
[11]
Ann Watts.
[11]
Susan Watts (1795-1823), who married her cousin Philip Kearny (1780-1849).
[11]
Elizabeth Watts (d. 1866),
[12]
who married Henry Laight.
[11]
Mary Justina Watts (1801-1821),
[12]
who married
Frederic de Peyster
(1796-1882) in 1820.
[11]
John Watts died at his longtime home, 3 Broadway in New York City, on September 3, 1836.  He was interred in a vault in
Trinity Churchyard
.
[1]
In 1839, his family's Rose Hill estate and manor house were purchased by the Catholic Church to establish
St. John's College
.
[9]
Descendants
[
edit
]
Through his daughter Susan, he was the grandfather of Gen.
Philip Kearny
(1815-1862), a
United States Army
officer notable for his leadership in the
Mexican-American War
and

; 23 months ago

Platforms
NCS 5x0, NCS 5x00, 8000, ASR 9000 and XRv 9000 Series Routers

IOS XR
is a
release train
of
Cisco Systems
' widely deployed
Internetwork Operating System (IOS)
, used on their high-end Network Convergence System (NCS) and carrier-grade
routers
such as the
ASR 9000
series and
Carrier Routing System
series of routers.
Architecture
[
edit
]
According to Cisco's product literature, IOS XR shares very little infrastructure with the other IOS trains, and is instead built upon a "
preemptive
,
memory protected
,
multitasking
,
microkernel-based
operating system
".
[1]
The microkernel was formerly provided by
QNX
;
[2]
versions 6.0 onwards use the
Wind River Linux
distribution.
[3]
IOS XR aims to provide the following advantages over the earlier IOS trains:
Improved
high availability
(largely through support for
hardware redundancy
and fault containment methods such as protected memory spaces for individual processes and process restartability)
Better scalability for large hardware configurations (through a
distributed
software infrastructure and a two-stage
forwarding
architecture)
A
package
based software distribution model (allowing optional features such as
multicast routing
and
MPLS
to be installed and removed while the router is in service)
The ability to install package upgrades and
patches
(potentially while the router remains in service)
A web-based
GUI
for system management (making use of a generic,
XML
management interface)
History
[
edit
]
IOS XR was announced along with the
CRS-1
in May 2004.
[4]
The first generally available version was 2.0.
Some significant releases include the following.
3.2
- first generally available version for the
12000
router series
3.9
- first generally available version for the
ASR 9000
router series
5.0
- first generally available version for the NCS6000 series, which is based upon a
Linux kernel
instead of QNX, and was released in September 2013
[5]
6.1.1
-  Introduces support for the 64-bit Linux-based IOS XR operating system on ASR 9000 series

Website
Answers.com
, formerly known as
WikiAnswers
, is an
Internet-based knowledge exchange
. The Answers.com domain name was purchased by entrepreneurs
Bill Gross
and Henrik Jones at
idealab
in 1996.
[1]
The domain name was acquired by NetShepard and subsequently sold to GuruNet and then AFCV Holdings. The website is now the primary product of the
Answers Corporation
. It has tens of millions of user-generated questions and answers, and provides a website where registered users can interact with one another.
History
[
edit
]
GuruNet was founded in
Jerusalem
during 1999 to develop technology that intelligently and automatically integrates and retrieves information from disparate sources and delivers the result in a single consolidated view to the user. GuruNet initially displayed its information through a downloadable software product, today known as
1-Click Answers
. The product was launched as a free product in 1999. Beginning in 2003 it was sold to users on a
perpetual license
base and later as an annual subscription.
[2]
In October 2004, GuruNet had an
IPO
on the
American Stock Exchange
(AMEX) under the symbol "GRU" and also acquired the Answers.com domain name early the same year for $80,000.
[3]
In January 2005, the company began a new business model of free-to-customer product. Answers.com and
1-Click Answers
software, containing practically all the content that was sold via subscriptions. The new model was based on generating advertising revenue.
[2]
On August 2, 2005, the company's shares started trading on
NASDAQ
instead of AMEX under the symbol "ANSW".
[3]
On October 17, 2005, GuruNet changed its corporate name to Answers Corporation, unifying the company's name and its website, Answers.com.
[3]
From 2005 to late 2009, the
Google
search engine definitions feature, in the top-right corner of the site, was linked to Answers.com.
[4]
On July 2, 2006, Answers.com released a trivia game known as
blufr
.
[

]
In November 2006, Answers.com acquired the question and answer site FAQ Farm.
[5]
Following the acquisition, the product was renamed WikiAnswers.
[6]
In the fall of 2009, Answers.com launched a revamped version of their website that fully integrated WikiAnswers.
[7]
At
Jeff Pulver
's 140 Characters Conference in New York City in April 2010, Answers.com launched its alpha version of a
Twitter
-answering service nicknamed 'Hoopoe.' When tweeting a question to the site's official Twitter account, @AnswersDotCom, an automatic reply is given with a snippet of the answer and a link to the full answer page on Answers.com.
[8]
Aside from providing community-generated Q&A and reference information for published titles, Answers.com began offering videos as part of its VideoAnswers library, in July 2010. This was part of a partnership with video site 5min.
[9]
In September 2010,
blufr
was relaunched as an iPhone/iPod Touch app with new design, game modes, and social features.
[10]
It was announced in November 2010 that the Answers.com Q&A wiki community reached its 10 millionth answer.
[11]
At the start of 2011, the site surpassed 11 million answers. Shortly after, on February 3, Answers.com announced in a press release that it had agreed to be acquired by AFCV Holdings for $127 million in cash. AFCV Holdings, LLC, is a portfolio company of growth equity investor
Summit Partners
.
Bob Rosenschein
was quoted: "The acquisition price of $10.50 per share represents a significant cash premium of approximately 33% over our 90-day volume-weighted average closing stock price."
[12]
[13]
[14]
On April 23, 2012,
TA Associates
announced that it was joining as an additional private investor in Answers.com and on May 1, 2012, laid off the remaining development staff in the Jerusalem office as a first step in fully assimilating the company.
[15]
On August 8, 2012, reports surfaced that Answers.com had reached a preliminary agreement to acquire
About.com
from
The New York Times Company
for $270 million of debt and equity.
[16]
However, it was thwarted by
IAC
, who countered with a $300 million "clean cash" offer.
[17]
On December 23, 2013, Answers.com acquired ForeSee Results, Inc., a customer experience & customer survey analytics company based in
Ann Arbor, Michigan
, USA.
[18]
Answers.com proceeded to lay off between 50 and 75 employees one month after the acquisition, followed by another 100 layoffs 18 months later.
[19]
In August 2014,
Apax Partners
acquired Answers Corp. for $900 million. The terms of the deal were that Apax would own 91% of the company while Answers’ founders and management team will own the remaining 9% stake.
[20]
In March 2017, Answers.com parent company, Answers Corp, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
[21]
As of May 3, 2018, Answers.com abandoned their wiki format, according to Chris Hawkins, Vice President, Business Operations. The entire user database was purged, and users can no longer edit questions or answers on the site; however, the site's content will remain available to read.
[22]
In October 2019, Answers.com re-launched
user-generated content
enabling new user registrations, questions, multiple answers, reactions, and comments.
In September 2020, Answers.com launched native iOS and Android apps focused on Homework Help Q&A.
In May 2022, Answers.com was purchased by System1.

Website
Sollana
is a
municipality
in the
comarca
of
Ribera Baixa
in the
Valencian Community
, Spain. The municipality includes a second village:
El Romaní
.
Situated on the floodplain of the
Júcar River
,
[2]
the Sollana region is where rice was first grown in Spain 1,200 years ago,
[3]
and is also the heartland of the famous Spanish dish
paella
.
[4]
The economy of the area is still based mainly on agriculture: rice, oranges and livestock.
The Sisters of Mercy Convent in Sollana
In the early
Middle Ages
, Sollana was a small
Visigothic
settlement. Later, records from the
al-Andalus
period name it Sulyanah, chief village of a region including the hamlets of Romaní, Alcahecia and Trullás. After the
Reconquista
in the thirteenth century,
James I of Aragon
gave it to his vassal Ximén d'Urrea, and it eventually ended up part of the
Dukedom of Híjar
. In January 1932, during the
Second Spanish Republic
, anarchists briefly declared a Soviet Republic of Sollana.
[5]
The patron saint of Sollana is
Mary Magdalene
. She is celebrated annually in the summer festivities, which begin on her feast day, July 22, and continue through August 14, when the city council throws a "night of the paellas" in the city centre, and end in late August with a traditional
bullring
.

Chariot of the Gods
is the tenth studio album by Australian
rock
group
Hoodoo Gurus
, released on 11 March 2022. It is the first studio album by the band since
Purity of Essence
in 2010.
Upon announcement
Dave Faulkner
said:
[8]
[9]
The last two years have been frustrating and nerve-racking for everyone, but for the Hoodoo Gurus, this dark cloud has had a silver lining. Forced to rely on ourselves instead of the outside world for validation, there has been a creative rebirth within the band that has resulted in a new album. Most important of all, the musical bonds between the four of us have never been stronger. When the discussions are all about which songs we're sad about having to leave off the record, that's a damn good sign. I'm tellin' ya, folks, we've got a real spring in our step right now.
The album was performed in its entirety for the first time via an exclusive live special event recording from Damien Gerard Studios on the NSW Central Coast on 10 March 2022.
[10]
The album's vinyl release was pushed back to 31 April due to COVID-19-related supply chain issues.

Irish boxer
For other people named Alexander Robinson, see
Alexander Robinson (disambiguation)
.
Buck Alec in his later years
Alexander "Buck Alec" Robinson
(c. 1901-1995) was a boxer,
Ulster loyalist
paramilitary and
Ulster Special Constabulary
reservist. Robinson gained notoriety in Northern Ireland for
streetfighting
,
[1]
[2]
robbery
[3]
and for owning a pet lion. His contemporaries included James "Stormy" Wetherall and Patrick "Silver" McKee.
[3]
Early life
[
edit
]
Born on
York Street
in the
Sailortown
area of
Belfast
,
Ireland
, around 1901, Robinson's early life in the docks was indicative of his future problems with the law. In 1913 at the age of twelve, he was arrested on a charge of
larceny
.
[3]
In 1916 he was arrested three more times for the same offence. He was discharged on three out of four of these first offences, and received probation for the other.
[3]
He served in the
British Merchant Navy
towards the end of World War I. On his return to Belfast his criminal career expanded, being charged with assault, riotous behaviour and robbery by 1921.
[3]
Career in the Ulster Special Constabulary
[
edit
]
In October 1920, the British Government formed the
Ulster Special Constabulary
(USC) after calls from
Unionists
for protection. This was to reinforce the
Royal Irish Constabulary
who, along with the
Black and Tans
, were fighting the Irish Republican Army in the
Irish War of Independence
.
The USC was formed on 1 November 1920, and consisted mainly of former
Ulster Volunteers
and other soldiers of the
36th (Ulster) Division
who had served in World War I. Robinson was recruited to the USC's C1 section, which was made up of unpaid, non-uniformed reservists usually only called up in emergencies.
[4]
Joe Graham
of
Rushlight Magazine
has stated that Robinson was given the option of prison or joining up after assaulting a member of the wealthy Thompson family on the Glencairn Road, with Thompson's own hammer.
[3]
During this time Robinson claimed to have been
Dawson Bates'
bodyguard, who was Minister for Home Affairs in
Sir James Craig's
government.
He won his first significant amateur boxing bout at the
King's Hall
in 1922 representing the USC and would later go on to win the Irish middleweight championship in 1927.
[5]
Interned
[
edit
]
As well as being a Special Constable, Robinson was also a member of the loyalist paramilitary group, the
Ulster Protestant Association
. The group's aim, according to a police report of 1923, was "simply the extermination of Catholics by any and every means".
[6]
The police thought Robinson, who led a UPA group on Andrews street, was, "a dangerous gunman and leader of a murderous gang". In the press he was known as the "Docklands gunman and bomber"
[7]
With the end of the Anglo-Irish war and
partition
in 1922, Robinson left the USC. After being implicated in several shootings and bombings he was
interned
in October 1922.
[3]
Several documents on his detention exist, including a letter from the RUC Commissioner recommending his internment:
"The respectable and law-abiding Protestants and Unionists residing in the area want to have these men taken from the locality at any cost, as they truly state there can be no peace so long as they are at large."
Another police report states:
"No matter what part of the City there is fighting in, he goes there to give a hand. He does not know what fear is, and would go any place to shoot and kill with either rifle, revolver or bomb."
The documents also contain other incidents Robinson was implicated in, including several shootings and a bombing. Robinson was released in 1923 and agreed to relocate to
Bolton
. He soon returned and was reinterned, and released again in late 1923.
[8]
His second release may have been secured through the promise that he would move to Chicago where he had relatives. In an interview with the north Belfast playwright
Martin Lynch
in the 1980s, Robinson claimed he worked for
Al Capone
and
Joseph Kennedy
.
[5]
He was later deported from the United States.
[9]
Criminal convictions
[
edit
]
Robinson was back in Belfast by the late 1920s. Writer
Sam McAughtry
recalled a banner reading "Welcome Home Buck Alec" being raised above York Street in the city.
[5]
His criminal convictions continued through to World War II. Around this time he acquired three lions.
[10]
Sources vary as to how these were acquired, one that they came from a visiting circus which Robinson allowed to use waste ground he owned at the rear of his house on Back Ship Street. Journalist Seth Linder writes that the lions were acquired from
Dublin
and
Belfast Zoo
, with Alec displaying them at a travelling circus throughout Ireland.
[5]
He kept the toothless lions at his home. Belfast folklore tells of him walking them on the streets of Sailortown. He continued to be known as a streetfighter into his fifties. Local newspapers regularly covered his fights in Belfast, the last known being in 1959. In court Robinson claimed he had knocked a man unconscious as he disagreed with the language he was using.
Death and tributes
[
edit
]
Buck Alec continued to live in north Belfast until his death in 1995.
Gusty Spence
and
Ian Paisley
attended his funeral, the latter carrying the coffin and describing Robinson as "a rare character, a typical Ulsterman, an interesting facet of Ulster's history". A report in the
Irish News
focused on his paramilitary past. Other reports stated that "his heart was in the right place" and that Catholics attended his funeral alongside Protestants.
In his book
Formations of Violence
,
Allen Feldman
argues that Robinson was seen as a "hard man" who believed in a fair fight, rather than a common thug.

Sir Hugh Williams, 8th Baronet
(
c.
1718
- 19 August 1794), was a British soldier and politician who sat in the
House of Commons
between 1768 and 1794.
Early life
[
edit
]
Williams was born in 1718 and was the son of Col. Griffith Williams of Arianws, near Llangelynin, Caernarvonshire and, his wife, Mary Williams.
[1]
He entered the
British Army
in 1739 and was Captain in the
34th Foot
in 1744. He succeeded to the
baronetcy
on the death of his cousin Sir Robert Williams, 7th Baronet, in November 1745.
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
In 1756 he was a major in the
6th Foot
and was at
Menorca
when the garrison was attacked in that year. In  1759 he was in a volunteer battalion in the
85th Foot
.
[3]
Correspondence indicates that Williams was becoming involved in politics in
Beaumaris
, partly in the interest of his stepson
Thomas Bulkeley
, but was handicapped by the secrecy of his marriage (because of his father-in-law's disapproval of Williams). In the course of these dealings, he became Lt Colonel in the
53rd Foot
in 1761 and became Constable of
Beaumaris Castle
in July 1761. However, his regiment was stationed in
Gibraltar
and he was ordered to return to military duties on the European continent. Williams disliked the climate and wished to be transferred to a regiment at home. As this was refused he retired from the army on half-pay in December 1764 to take care of affairs at
Beaumaris
.
[2]
Political career
[
edit
]
In
1768
he was elected
Member of Parliament
for
Beaumaris
but made little contribution.  His stepson Thomas Bulkeley joined him in parliament in 1774 and was encouraging him to take a greater interest. However he found parliamentary business tiresome and stood down in 1780.
[2]
He returned as MP for Beaumaris in a by-election in 1785 and retained the seat until his death on 19 August 1794.
[2]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Williams married Emma Bridget (
née
Rowlands) Bulkeley, the dowager Viscountess Bulkeley, widow of
James Bulkeley, 6th Viscount Bulkeley
on 28 June 1760. She was daughter of Thomas Rowlands of Caerau,
Anglesey
, but as her father disapproved of Williams, the marriage was kept secret.
[3]
Together, they were the parents of two sons and two daughters, including:
[4]
Sir Robert Williams, 9th Baronet
(1764-1830), who married Anne Lewis, daughter of the Rev. Edward Hughes Lewis, in 1799.
[5]
Sir Hugh died on 19 August 1794 and was succeeded by his eldest son
Robert
.

The
supreme nasal concha
or
highest nasal concha
is a
nasal concha
(turbinate) that occurs in some cases. It is shaped like a seashell and found on the posterosuperior part of the lateral nasal wall.
[2]
It lies on the medial surface of the
labyrinth of ethmoid
above the
superior nasal concha
. This makes it the highest of the nasal conchae, and the highest of three on the
ethmoid bone
. It is often no more than a small, simple crest protruding from the nasal wall.
The space below and the fissure lateral to the concha are known as the
supreme
nasal meatus
.
[2]
It was historically known as
Santorini's concha
, after
Giovanni Domenico Santorini

Eli Goldston
(March 8, 1920 - January 21, 1974) was an American business leader and a leading spokesman for corporate social responsibility. He was President and CEO of Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates of
Boston
,
Massachusetts
, from 1961 until 1974.

[2]
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Eli Goldston was born on March 8, 1920, in
Warren, Ohio
. He was educated at
Harvard University
(A.B. 1942),
Harvard Business School
(M.B.A. 1946), and
Harvard Law School
(LL.B. 1949.).
[3]
Career
[
edit
]
As chief executive of Eastern Gas and Fuel, Goldston ran diversified energy corporation with 19 subsidiaries in the
bituminous coal
,
coke
, gas utility and river-ocean marine industries.
[3]
He was best known, however, for his belief that liberal politics and corporate success could go hand in hand. He is quoted as having said: "I don't believe that business, alone, can solve our social problems. Neither do I believe it, alone, has caused them. But they'll not get solved unless innovative businessmen, who sense a changing world and feel challenged, react in a fashion likely to produce profit as well as imaginative response to social need."
[3]
Goldston's most visible legacy is the
Rainbow Swash
, a giant 1971 artwork by
Corita Kent
that Goldston commissioned on a 140-foot (43 m) tall
liquefied natural gas
tank facing Boston's
Southeast Expressway
.
[4]
The artwork was added to another gas tank on the
Dorchester
waterfront in 1992 when the original LNG tank was torn down.
[5]
[6]
The Rainbow Swash is reportedly the largest copyrighted work of art in the world.
[7]
The mural drew controversy when critics believed they saw the face of
Vietnamese
leader
Ho Chi Minh
's face in its blue stripe,
[7]
which Goldston and Kent both denied.
[8]
[9]
Death and legacy
[
edit
]
Goldston died on January 21, 1974.
[1]
Two professorships at Harvard University, one in the law school and one in the business school, were established in his memory, "join their skills and commitments in teaching, research and course development … to improve social conditions through men and women trained and motivated in management and legal fields." Goldston also established two funds at Harvard Law School, the Issachar J. Goldston Memorial Scholarship and the Gertrude R. Goldston Scholarship.

His son is physicist

Sarah Dessen
(born June 6, 1970) is an American novelist who lives in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina
. Born in Illinois, Dessen graduated from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Her first book,
That Summer
, was published in 1996. She has since published more than a dozen other novels and novellas. In 2017, Dessen won the
Margaret Edwards Award
for some of her work. Two of her books were adapted into the 2003 film
How to Deal
.
Early life, education and personal life
[
edit
]
Dessen was born in
Evanston, Illinois
, on June 6, 1970, to Alan and Cynthia Dessen, who were both professors at the
University of North Carolina
, teaching Shakespearean literature and classics.
[1]
As a teenager, Dessen was very shy and quiet. She became involved with a 21-year-old when she was 15 but cut all contact with him shortly after. In a piece penned for
Seventeen
, Dessen wrote "for many years afterward, I took total blame for everything that happened between me and T. After all, I was a bad kid. I did drugs, I lied to my mom. You can't just hang out with a guy and not expect him to get ideas, I told myself. You should have known better. But maybe
he
should have. When I turned 21, I remember making a point, regularly, to look at teens and ask myself whether I'd want to hang out with them, much less date one. The answer was always a flat, immediate no. They were kids. I was an adult. End of story."
[2]
Dessen attended
Greensboro College
in
Greensboro, North Carolina
, but dropped out before the end of the first semester. Upon moving back home she enrolled at the
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
, to take classes in
creative writing
, resulting in her graduating with highest honors in 1993.
[1]
Today Dessen lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with her husband Jay and daughter Sasha Clementine.
Career
[
edit
]
Dessen waitressed at the Flying Burrito restaurant in
Chapel Hill
and was Lee Smith's assistant while launching her writing career.
[3]
It was Smith who passed one of Dessen's manuscripts to an agent.
[4]
After the 1996 publication of her first book,
That Summer
, Dessen continued working at the restaurant.
[5]
Following the publication of
Dreamland
, Dessen taught at the
University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill
.
[6]
[7]
She became a full-time writer before the 2006 release of
Just Listen
.
Dessen's
Along for the Ride
made the
New York Times
Best Sellers List
in 2009.
[8]
After its publication, Dessen was referred to as a "best-seller machine".
[9]
In November 2019, an
Aberdeen News
article quoted a comment from 2016 by a
Northern State University
alumna regarding the University's 'Common Read' program, which identifies books "representing diverse points of view" for undergraduate students to read as part of their curriculum.
[10]
The student, Brooke Nelson, said she became involved with the program "simply so I could stop them from ever choosing Sarah Dessen." Regarding Dessen's book, Nelson stated, "She’s fine for teen girls, but definitely not up to the level of Common Read."
[11]
Dessen posted parts of this interview that were critical of her on Twitter, redacting Nelson's name and the institution but stating that the comments were "mean and cruel”.
[12]
Her post was supported by a number of authors, including
Jodi Picoult
,
Jennifer Weiner
,
Siobhan Vivian
, and
Roxane Gay
.
[13]
[14]
Following this, Northern State University issued an apology for the alumna's comments.
[15]
Dessen subsequently deleted her tweet and apologized for her remarks, acknowledging that it had resulted in her fans connecting her comments with their source to identify and harass Nelson that led to the former student deleting her social media accounts.
[16]
Dessen stated, "With a platform and a following, I have a responsibility to be aware of what I put out there."
[17]
Several of the other authors who had supported Dessen initially also apologized to Nelson, noting that they had supported Dessen’s expression of her feelings but did not support the subsequent identification and bullying of Nelson.
[18]
[10]
Awards and honors
[
edit
]
Some of her novels have been among the ALA's "
Best Fiction for Young Adults
" selections:
That Summer
(1997),
Someone Like You
(1999),
Keeping the Moon
(2000),
Dreamland
(2001),
This Lullaby
(2003),
Just Listen
(2007), and
Along for the Ride
(2010).
[19]
Someone Like You
was also one of the two winners of the 1999 "School Library Journal Best Book" award, and
Keeping the Moon
was the sole winner the next year.
[20]
In 2017, Dessen was awarded the
Margaret A. Edwards Award
for her novels
Dreamland
(2001),
Keeping the Moon
(2000),
Just Listen
(2007),
The Truth About Forever
(2004),
Along for the Ride
(2010),
What Happened to Goodbye
(2011), and
This Lullaby
(2002).
[21]
Themes and writing style
[
edit
]
In 2017, Dessen was interviewed by Anna Gragert. During the interview, Gragert asked Dessen about the style she uses in some of her books, otherwise known as "effortless perfection". Dessen describes this term as the young girls in her books being able to have friends, look good, be a good student and have one's life together, and to make it look easy. At the start of the book, the reader is supposed to relate with the main characters and throughout their changes in the book, the reader should see that it is okay to not have everything together and not be perfect. Gragert asked Dessen about her anxiety coping mechanisms because writing tends to cause an author to be anxious. Dessen said that she likes to exercise and read in her free time because all writers are going to be anxious, it's part of the process, but it also opens their mind more because they see the world differently than readers.

in Northeast
Florida
.
[1]
The line begins in
Jacksonville
at a junction with the A Line near Moncrief Yard.  From there, it heads east and then turns north near Panama Park.  From Panama Park, the Kingsland Subdivision heads north to
Yulee
on a discontinuous piece of CSX's S Line.  In Yulee, the line connects with the
First Coast Railroad
, which operates north to
Seals, Georgia
, on tracks that were previously part of the Kingsland Subdivision prior to 2005.  The line's namesake is
Kingsland, Georgia
, which is located north of Yulee on the First Coast Railroad.

History
[
edit
]
Kingsland Subdivision bridge over Trout River
See also:
Main Line (Seaboard Air Line Railroad)
and
Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad
From Jacksonville to Panama Park, the line was originally the easternmost segment of the
Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad
which was built in 1899.  In 1904, the Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad became part of the
Atlantic Coast Line Railroad
, which would merge with the
Seaboard Air Line Railroad
in 1967.
[4]
From Panama Park north, the line was built by the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, which was organized in 1874 and opened in 1881.  The Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad would later become part of the
Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad
(FC&P).  FC&P would charter the Florida Northern Railroad to extend the line north of Yulee to
Savannah, Georgia
, in 1894 to connect with the
South Bound Railroad
(which was absorbed by the FC&P in 1893).
In 1900, the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad became part of the
Seaboard Air Line Railroad
, and the line became Seaboard's
main line
.
[5]
The Seaboard would designate the main line between
Savannah, Georgia
and Jacksonville as the
Jacksonville Subdivision
.
[6]
Seaboard Air Line became the
Seaboard Coast Line Railroad
(SCL) after merging with the Atlantic Coast Line in 1967.  The Seaboard Air Line's main line was then known as the S Line after the merger to differentiate it the former Atlantic Coast Line's nearby main line (the
A Line
).  After the merger, the S Line between Savannah and Jacksonville was renamed the
Everett Subdivision
.
[7]
The Seaboard Coast Line became the
CSX Corporation
in the 1980s.  CSX abandoned the line from
Riceboro, Georgia
, to Seals, Georgia, gradually from 1985 to 1986 and redesignated the remaining track to the south as the Kingsland Subdivision.
[8]
CSX then leased the line from Yulee north to Seals (and the former Fernandina Subdivision from Yulee to Fernandina) to the
First Coast Railroad
in 2005.
[9]
The S Line south of Panama park was abandoned in the 1980s.
[10]
The former
Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad
has been used to connect the remaining line to the rest of the
Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision
ever since.  The original Seaboard Air Line track from Panama Park south to Jacksonville is now the S-Line Urban Greenway.

A boycott of the 1997
Golden North Salmon Derby
, held in
Juneau, Alaska
, was called for by the
Alaska Native Brotherhood
(ANB) because of the political stances of the Territorial Sportsmen Inc. (TSI), the derby's sponsor, on the issues of subsistence, Indian Country, the creation of five new Southeast native corporations passed over by the
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
, and the classification of halibut as a subsistence food.
[1]
After a month of public debate and several days of mediated discussion an accord was signed by both groups, with TSI agreeing to not use derby funds for political advocacy, the ANB agreeing to call off the boycott, and periodic town hall meetings established for discussion on the issues raised by the ANB.
[2]

Boycott events
[
edit
]
The boycott was announced by ANB Grand Camp president Richard Stitt, made public July 14, 1997, in the
Juneau Empire
, little over a month before the scheduled derby date.
[3]
Stitt said TSI had opposed them on the issues of subsistence and Native corporation creation in aggressive ways that pointed at racism.
[4]
At the Southeast Native Subsistence Summit of July 18 and 19 it was unanimously voted to back the ANB's boycott.
[5]
Territorial Sportsmen Inc. responded to the call for a boycott with a six-page letter to the ANB asking them to rethink the boycott and for a chance to meet to communicate; in the letter the TSI's stances were reaffirmed, but it was stressed that TSI had a "racially blind policy" for membership and scholarship recipients from derby proceeds.
[6]
Ron Somerville, TSI's president, called the ANB's claim that TSI was racist "absurd" and claimed the boycott would hurt Natives who otherwise could have benefited from scholarship money provided through the competition.
[7]
In a Juneau Chamber of Commerce luncheon on July 18 Somerville asked Stitt if his resignation would end the boycott, to which the answer was no.
[8]
Several businesses informed both groups of their intent to drop sponsorship of the derby.
[9]
On July 21 Mayor
Dennis Egan
, along with the Juneau assembly, offered for the city to pay for a professional mediator because of concerns that the disagreement would cause community conflict.
[10]
A list of potential mediators was given to both groups. The offer of mediation was accepted August 8,  with Catholic Bishop Michael Warfel acting as mediator.
[11]
Also on August 8, a protest against the boycott was held by the United Native Shareholders, citing as reasons that they were upset at the ANB's control over where they were allowed to fish and that the ANB's time would be better spent writing to Congress about their inequities rather than targeting an organization that had its own political agenda; the protest only had an eight-person turn out, three of whom were kids.
[12]
The mediated talks started on the 15th of August. The ANB said they would suspend the boycott if TSI pledged to spend all derby proceeds on scholarships (with none going to political lobbying) and if TSI pledged to talk about the issues of subsistence and Native corporation creation.
[13]
TSI claimed that already the net income of the derby went into the scholarship funds,
[14]
but refused to accept the ANB's requests unless the ANB apologized for calling them 'racist'.
[15]
The ANB agreed to apologize for calling TSI racist, if TSI would apologize for an undisclosed statement made in correspondence.
[16]
August 21, a day before the start of the derby, an accord was signed by both groups calling off the boycott under certain stipulations.
[17]
Aftermath
[
edit
]
In the accord, TSI agreed to provide their financial statements from '96 and '97 to the ANB and to only use membership fees and general donations to fund their political advocacy; the ANB agreed to call off the boycott; both groups agreed to jointly preside over periodic town hall meetings to discuss the issues raised by the ANB and to hold periodic summit sessions to brainstorm solutions to these issues.
[18]
The first of these summit sessions was held November 18, 1997.
[19]
By January 21, 1998 TSI had sent their financial summary to ANB, as agreed to in the accord.
[20]
The town hall style meeting was set for March 26, 1998; each side got thirty minutes for a presentation, followed by an open question and answer period.
[21]
There were about 70 audience members in attendance. The ANB's presentation started off with a talk on the relationship between Native tribes and the federal government and misunderstanding over Native sovereignty's effects in Alaska; it continued to a discussion of subsistence and the creation of new Native corporations.
[22]
The Territorial Sportsmen Inc.'s presentation reinstated that they held opposing views to the ANB, that they were strong supporters of state rights, and that they would have to "agree to disagree".
[23]
Stitt expressed disappointment that the TSI was continuing to argue with them. A representative from the TSI said that Stitt expected more out of the forum (namely, for them to change their political positions) than they were willing to give. The meeting was broadcast on television. The fish yield of the 1997 derby was 25% lower than usual—possible factors contributing to this, in addition to the proposed boycott, include bad weather and a late salmon run that year.
[24]
In running for reelection, Egan's action in promoting mediation between the two groups was used as a demonstration of his diplomacy

Difference between traditional and typical
[
edit
]
Although it is common for them to be used as synonyms, the truth is that "traditional" cuisine and "typical" cuisine are considered two different concepts according to
culinary anthropology
; The first refers to culinary customs that are invariably inherited
orally
, on a small scale in the family, and a large scale in a community as part of its
culture
and
identity
. On the other hand, when we speak of typical (or "popular") cuisine, it is one that most people in a place like and is massively replicated.
[5]
Therefore, a traditional dish may be typical and vice versa, but neither much less all the typical dishes are traditional nor the traditional ones are typical.
Most traditional dishes are originated from the skill of housewives who creatively and sensibly combined the
techniques
and ingredients they had on hand to create new recipes. If people like that recipe, it becomes worthy of being imitated. In other words, it is spread and replicated so many times that it becomes a
classic
recipe. For this reason, the culinary tradition is made up of a vast variety of classic recipes, which are necessarily linked to a land of origin, specific products, and specific local habits. There are classic recipes that can fall into oblivion and disappear forever, but if they are consumed massively, they become part of the typical cuisine of a place. The Mexican culinary anthropologist
Maru Toledo
adds a third concept to this process, which is that of "typical commercial" cuisine,
[6]
something that did not exist until the commercialization of cuisine (a process that has occurred very recently, if we observe the complete chronology of food history).
Commercialized cuisine
[
edit
]
The
commercialized cuisine
appropriates the characteristics of the traditional (even the same adjective "traditional", on numerous occasions) but the aim is none other than economic profit. For this reason, it does not want to delve into the origin, nor in the context, much less the diversity around the dishes, it sells. Finally, the mainstream population, generally without much culinary knowledge, believe that the food they are buying is their own, thus happening a kind of
food acculturation
[7]
and simplifying the diversity of products, techniques, recipes and other culinary aspects of the tradition.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In
mathematics
, a
Hurwitz polynomial
, named after
Adolf Hurwitz
, is a
polynomial
whose
roots
(zeros) are located in the left half-plane of the
complex plane
or on the imaginary axis, that is, the
real part
of every root is zero or negative.
[1]
Such a polynomial must have
coefficients
that are positive
real numbers
. The term is sometimes restricted to polynomials whose roots have real parts that are strictly negative, excluding the imaginary axis (i.e., a Hurwitz
stable polynomial
).
[2]
[3]
A polynomial function
P
(
s
) of a
complex variable
s
is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:
1.
P
(
s
) is real when
s
is real.
2. The roots of
P
(
s
) have real parts which are zero or negative.
Hurwitz polynomials are important in
control systems theory
, because they represent the
characteristic equations
of
stable
linear systems
.  Whether a polynomial is Hurwitz can be determined by solving the equation to find the roots, or from the coefficients without solving the equation by the
Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion
.
Examples
[
edit
]
A simple example of a Hurwitz polynomial is:
x
2
+
2
x
+
1.
{\displaystyle x^{2}+2x+1.}
The only real solution is −1, because it factors as
(
x
+
1
)
2
.
{\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}.}
In general, all
quadratic polynomials
with positive coefficients are Hurwitz.
This follows directly from the
quadratic formula
:
x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
.
{\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac\ }}}{2a}}.}
where, if the discriminant
b
2
−4
ac
is less than zero, then the polynomial will have two
complex-conjugate
solutions with real part −
b
/2
a
, which is negative for positive
a
and
b
.
If the discriminant is equal to zero, there will be two coinciding real solutions at −
b
/2
a
. Finally, if the discriminant is greater than zero, there will be two real negative solutions,
because
b
2
−
4
a
c
<
b
{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}<b}
for positive
a
,
b
and
c
.
Properties
[
edit
]
For a polynomial to be Hurwitz, it is necessary but not sufficient that all of its coefficients be positive (except for quadratic polynomials, which also imply sufficiency).  A necessary and sufficient condition that a polynomial is Hurwitz is that it passes the
Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion
.  A given polynomial can be efficiently tested to be Hurwitz or not by using the Routh continued fraction expansion technique.

The
Gloster Meteor
was the first British
jet fighter
and the
Allies
' only
jet aircraft
to engage in combat operations during the
Second World War
. The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking
turbojet
engines, pioneered by
Frank Whittle
and his company,
Power Jets Ltd
. Development of the aircraft began in 1940, although work on the engines had been under way since 1936. The Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with
No. 616 Squadron RAF
. The Meteor was not a sophisticated aircraft in its aerodynamics, but proved to be a successful combat fighter. Gloster's 1946 civil Meteor F.4 demonstrator
G-AIDC
was the first
civilian-registered
jet aircraft in the world.
[1]
Several major variants of the Meteor incorporated technological advances during the 1940s and 1950s. Thousands of Meteors were built to fly with the RAF and other air forces and remained in use for several decades.
Slower and less heavily armed than its German counterpart, the jet-powered
Messerschmitt Me 262
,
[2]
the Meteor saw limited action in the Second World War. Meteors of the
Royal Australian Air Force
(RAAF) fought in the
Korean War
. Several other operators such as Argentina, Egypt and Israel flew Meteors in later regional conflicts. Specialised variants of the Meteor were developed for use in photographic
aerial reconnaissance
and as
night fighters
.
The Meteor was also used for research and development purposes and to break several aviation records. On 7 November 1945, the first official airspeed record by a jet aircraft was set by a Meteor F.3 at 606 miles per hour (975 km/h). In 1946, this record was broken when a Meteor F.4 reached a speed of 616 miles per hour (991 km/h). Other performance-related records were broken in categories including flight time endurance, rate of climb, and speed. On 20 September 1945, a heavily modified Meteor I, powered by two
Rolls-Royce Trent
turbine engines driving propellers, became the first
turboprop
aircraft to fly.
[3]
On 10 February 1954, a specially adapted Meteor F.8, the
"Meteor Prone Pilot"
, which placed the pilot into a
prone position
to counteract inertial forces, took its first flight.
[4]
In the 1950s, the Meteor became increasingly obsolete as more nations developed jet fighters, many of these newcomers having adopted a
swept wing
instead of the Meteor's conventional straight wing; in RAF service, the Meteor was replaced by newer types such as the
Hawker Hunter
and
Gloster Javelin
. As of 2023
, two Meteors,
G-JSMA
and
G-JWMA
, remain in active service with the
Martin-Baker
company as
ejection seat
testbeds.
[5]
One further aircraft in the USA remains airworthy, as does another in Australia.

and Frank Whittle's firm, Power Jets Ltd. Whittle formed Power Jets Ltd in March 1936 to develop his ideas of jet propulsion, Whittle himself serving as the company's chief engineer.
[6]
For several years, attracting financial backers and aviation firms prepared to take on Whittle's radical ideas was difficult; in 1931,
Armstrong-Siddeley
had evaluated and rejected Whittle's proposal, finding it to be technically sound but at the limits of engineering capability.
[7]
Securing funding was a persistently worrying issue throughout the early development of the engine.
[8]
The first Whittle prototype jet engine, the
Power Jets WU
, began running trials in early 1937; shortly afterwards, both Sir
Henry Tizard
, chairman of the
Aeronautical Research Committee
, and the
Air Ministry
gave the project their support.
[9]
On 28 April 1939, Whittle made a visit to the premises of the Gloster Aircraft Company, where he met several key figures, such as
George Carter
, Gloster's chief designer.
[10]
Carter took a keen interest in Whittle's project, particularly when he saw the operational
Power Jets W.1
engine; Carter quickly made several rough proposals of various aircraft designs powered by the engine. Independently, Whittle had also been producing several proposals for a high-altitude jet-powered bomber; following the start of the
Second World War
and the
Battle for France
, a greater national emphasis on fighter aircraft arose.
[11]
Power Jets and Gloster quickly formed a mutual understanding around mid-1939.
[12]
The
Gloster E.28/39
. The yellow undersides were standard for RAF training and
prototype
aircraft of the period.
In spite of ongoing infighting between Power Jets and several of its
stakeholders
, the Air Ministry contracted Gloster in late 1939 to manufacture a
prototype
aircraft powered by one of Whittle's new turbojet engines.
[13]
The single-engined
proof-of-concept
Gloster E28/39
, the first British jet-powered aircraft, conducted its maiden flight on 15 May 1941, flown by Gloster's chief test pilot, Flight Lieutenant
Philip "Gerry" Sayer
.
[14]
[15]
The success of the E.28/39 proved the viability of jet propulsion, and Gloster pressed ahead with designs for a production fighter aircraft.
[16]
Due to the limited thrust available from early jet engines, it was decided that subsequent production aircraft would be powered by a pair of turbojet engines.
[17]
In 1940, for a "military load" of 1,500 lb (680 kg), the
Royal Aircraft Establishment
(RAE) had advised that work on an aircraft of 8,500 lb (3,900 kg) all-up weight, with a total static thrust of 3,200 lbf (14 kN) should be started, with an 11,000 lb (5,000 kg) design for the expected, more powerful,
W.2
and
axial engine designs
. George Carter's calculations based on the RAE work and his own investigations were that a 8,700-to-9,000-pound (3,900-to-4,100-kilogram) aircraft with two or four 20 mm cannons and six 0.303 machine guns would have a top speed of 400-431 miles per hour (644-694 km/h) at sea level and 450-470 miles per hour (720-760 km/h) at 30,000 feet (9,100 m). In January 1941 Gloster were told by
Lord Beaverbrook
that the twin jet fighter was of "unique importance", and that the company was to stop work on a
night-fighter development of their F.9/37
to Specification F.18/40.
[18]
Prototypes
[

Prototype Meteor
DG202/G
on display at the
Royal Air Force Museum London
in 2011. The "/G" appended to the
aircraft serial
denoted that the aircraft was to have an
armed guard
at all times while it was on the ground.
In August 1940, Carter presented Gloster's initial proposals for a twin-engined jet fighter with a
tricycle undercarriage
.
[Note 1]
On 7 February 1941, Gloster received an order for twelve prototypes (later reduced to eight) under
Specification F9/40
.
[20]
A letter of intent for the production of 300 of the new fighter, initially to be named
Thunderbolt,
was issued on 21 June 1941; to avoid confusion with the USAAF
Republic P-47 Thunderbolt
which had been issued
with the same name to the RAF
in 1944, the aircraft's name was subsequently changed to
Meteor.
[21]
[22]
[Note 2]
During the aircraft's secretive development, employees and officials made use of the codename
Rampage
to refer to the Meteor, as similarly the
de Havilland Vampire
would initially be referred to as the
Spider Crab
. Test locations and other key project information were also kept secret.
[24]
Although
taxiing
trials were carried out in 1942, it was not until the following year that any flights took place due to production and approval holdups with the
Power Jets W.2
engine powering the Meteor.
[14]
[25]
On 26 November 1942 production of the Meteor was ordered to stop due to the delays at subcontractor
Rover
, which was struggling to manufacture the W.2 engines on schedule
[Note 3]
; considerable interest was shown in Gloster's
E.1/44 proposal
for a single-engine fighter, unofficially named Ace.
[27]
Gloster continued development work on the Meteor and the production-stop order was overturned in favour of the construction of six (later increased to eight) F9/40 prototypes alongside three E.1/44 prototypes.
[28]
Rover's responsibilities for development and production of the W.2B engine were also transferred to
Rolls-Royce
that year.
[29]
On 5 March 1943, the fifth prototype,
serial
DG206
, powered by two substituted
de Havilland Halford H.1
engines owing to problems with the intended W.2 engines, became the first Meteor to become airborne at
RAF Cranwell
, piloted by
Michael Daunt
.
[14]
On the initial flight, an uncontrollable
yawing
motion was discovered, which led to a redesigned larger rudder; however, no difficulties had been attributed to the groundbreaking turbojet propulsion.
[30]
[31]
Only two prototypes flew with de Havilland engines because of their low flight endurance.
[32]
Before the first prototype aircraft had even undertaken its first flight, an extended order for 100 production-standard aircraft had been placed by the RAF.
[33]
The first Whittle-engined aircraft,
DG205/G
,
[Note 4]
flew on 12 June 1943 (later crashing during takeoff on 27 April 1944) and was followed by
DG202/G
on 24 July.
DG202/G
was later used for deck handling tests aboard
aircraft carrier
HMS
Pretoria Castle
.
[35]
[36]
DG203/G
made its first flight on 9 November 1943, later becoming a ground instructional airframe.
DG204/G
, powered by
Metrovick F.2
engines, first flew on 13 November 1943;
DG204/G
was lost in an accident on 4 January 1944, the cause believed to have been an
engine compressor
failure due to overspeed.
[37]
DG208/G
made its début on 20 January 1944, by which time the majority of design problems had been overcome and a production design had been approved.
DG209/G
was used as an engine testbed by Rolls-Royce, first flying on 18 April 1944.
DG207/G
was intended to be the basis for the Meteor F.2 with
de Havilland
engines, but it did not fly until 24 July 1945, at which time the Meteor 3 was in full production and de Havilland's attention was being redirected to the upcoming
de Havilland Vampire
; consequently the F.2 was cancelled.
[38]
[39]

[41]
Into production
[
edit
]
Meteor being deployed in March 1945
On 12 January 1944, the first Meteor F.1, serial
EE210/G
, took to the air from
Moreton Valence
in Gloucestershire. It was essentially identical to the F9/40 prototypes except for the addition of four nose-mounted 20 mm (.79 in)
Hispano Mk V
cannon and some changes to the
canopy
to improve all-round visibility.
[42]
Due to the F.1's similarity to the prototypes, they were frequently operated in the test program to progress British understanding of jet propulsion, and it took until July 1944 for the aircraft to enter squadron service.
[43]
EE210/G
was later sent to the U.S. for evaluation in exchange for a pre-production
Bell YP-59A Airacomet
, the Meteor being flown first by
John Grierson
at
Muroc Army Airfield
on 15 April 1944.
[44]
Originally 300 F.1s were ordered, but the total produced was reduced to 20 aircraft as the follow-on orders had been converted to the more advanced models.
[45]
Some of the last major refinements to the Meteor's early design were trialled using this first production batch, and what was to become the long-term design of the engine nacelles was introduced upon
EE211
.
[46]
The original nacelles had been discovered by the RAE to suffer from
compressibility
buffeting at higher speeds, causing increased drag; the re-designed longer nacelles eliminated this and provided an increase in the Meteor's maximum speed. The lengthened nacelles were introduced on the final fifteen Meteor IIIs.
[3]
EE215
was the first Meteor to be fitted with guns;
EE215
was also used in
engine reheat
trials,
[47]
the addition of reheat increasing top speed from 420 mph to 460 mph.
[3]
and was later converted into the first two-seat Meteor.
[48]
Due to the radical differences between jet-powered aircraft and those that it replaced, a special
Tactical Flight
or
T-Flight
unit was established to prepare the Meteor for squadron service, led by
Group Captain
Hugh Joseph Wilson
.
[49]
The Tactical Flight was formed at
Farnborough
in May 1944, the first Meteors arriving the following month, upon which both tactical applications and limitations were extensively explored.
[50]
On 17 July 1944, the Meteor F.1 was cleared for service use. Shortly afterwards, elements of the Tactical Flight and their aircraft were transferred to operational RAF squadrons.
[51]
The first deliveries to No. 616 Squadron RAF, the first operational squadron to receive the Meteor, began in July 1944.
[33]
When the F.2 was cancelled, the Meteor F.3 became the immediate successor to the F.1 and alleviated some of the shortcomings of the F.1.
[52]
In August 1944, the first F.3 prototype flew; early F.3 production aircraft were still fitted with the Welland engine as the
Derwent
engine's production was just starting at this point. A total of 210 F.3 aircraft were produced before they were in turn superseded by production of the Meteor F.4 in 1945.
[53]
Several Meteor F.3s were converted into navalised aircraft. The adaptations included a strengthened undercarriage and arrester hook. Operational trials of the type took place aboard
HMS
Implacable
. The trials included carrier landings and takeoffs.
[54]
Performance of these naval prototype Meteors proved to be favourable, including takeoff performance, leading to further trials with a modified Meteor F.4 fitted with folding wings; a 'clipped wing' was also adopted.
[55]
The Meteor later entered service with the
Royal Navy
, but only as a land-based trainer, the Meteor T.7, to prepare pilots of the
Fleet Air Arm
for flying other jet aircraft such as the
de Havilland Sea Vampire
.
[56]
While various marks of Meteor had been introduced by 1948, they had remained very similar to the prototypes of the Meteor; consequently, the performance of the Meteor F.4 was beginning to be eclipsed by new jet designs. Gloster therefore embarked on a redesign programme to  produce a new version of the Meteor with better performance.
[57]
Designated 'Meteor F.8', this upgraded variant was a potent fighter aircraft, forming the bulk of RAF Fighter Command between 1950 and 1955. The Meteor continued to be operated in a military capacity by several nations into the 1960s.
[58]
Night fighter
[
edit
]
To replace the increasingly obsolete
de Havilland Mosquito
as a
night fighter
, the Meteor was adapted to serve in the role as an interim aircraft. Gloster had initially proposed a night fighter design to meet the Air Ministry specification for the Mosquito replacement, based on the two seater trainer variant of the Meteor, with the pilot in the front seat and the navigator in the rear.
[59]
Once accepted however, work on the project was swiftly transferred to Armstrong Whitworth to perform both the detailed design process and production of the type; the first prototype flew on 31 May 1950. Although based on the T.7 twin seater, it used the fuselage and tail of the F.8, and the longer wings of the F.3. An extended nose contained the AI Mk 10 (the 1940s Westinghouse SCR-720) Air Intercept radar. As a consequence the 20 mm cannons were moved into the wings, outboard of the engines. A ventral fuel tank and wing mounted drop tanks completed the Armstrong Whitworth Meteor NF.11.
[60]
[61]
Operational Meteor NF.14 of
No. 264 Squadron RAF
in 1955
As
radar
technology developed, a new Meteor night fighter was developed to use the improved US-built
APS-21
system. The
NF.12
first flew on 21 April 1953. It was similar to the NF.11 but had a nose section 17 inches (43 cm) longer;
[62]
the fin was enlarged to compensate for the greater keel area of the enlarged nose and to counter the airframe reaction to the sideways oscillating motion of the radar scanner which caused difficulty aiming the guns, an anti-tramp motor operating on the rudder was fitted midway up the front leading edge of the fin. The NF.12 also had the new Rolls-Royce Derwent 9 engines and the wings were reinforced to handle the new engine.
[63]
[64]
Deliveries of the NF.12 started in 1953, with the type entering squadron service in early 1954,
[65]
equipping seven squadrons (Nos
85
,
25
,
152
,
46
,
72
,
153
and
64
);
[66]
the aircraft was replaced over 1958-1959.
The final Meteor night fighter was the
NF.14
. First flown on 23 October 1953, the NF.14 was based on the NF.12 but had an even longer nose, extended by a further 17 inches to accommodate new equipment, increasing the total length to 51 ft 4 in (15.65 m) and a larger bubble canopy to replace the framed T.7 version.
[67]
Just 100 NF.14s were built; they first entered service in February 1954 beginning with No. 25 Squadron and were being replaced as early as 1956 by the
Gloster Javelin
. Overseas, they remained in service a little longer, serving with No. 60 Squadron at
Tengah
, Singapore until 1961. As the NF.14 was replaced, some 14 were converted to training aircraft as the
NF(T).14
and given to No. 2 Air Navigation School on
RAF Thorney Island
until transferring to No. 1 Air Navigation School at RAF Stradishall where they served until 1965.

Overview
[

]

RAF Greenham Common
, May 1986
Meteor F.8 cockpit
The first operational version of the Meteor, designated as the Meteor F.1, apart from the minor airframe refinements, was a straightforward 'militarisation' of the earlier F9/40 prototypes.
[69]
The dimensions of the standard Meteor F.1 were 41 ft 3 in (12.57 m) long with a span of 43 ft 0 in (13.11 m), with an empty weight of 8,140 lb (3,690 kg) and a maximum takeoff weight of 13,795 lb (6,257 kg).
[42]
Despite the revolutionary turbojet propulsion used,
[70]
the design of the Meteor was relatively orthodox and did not take advantage of many aerodynamic features used on other, later jet fighters, such as
swept wings
; the Meteor shared a broadly similar basic configuration to its German equivalent, the
Messerschmitt Me 262
, which was also aerodynamically conventional.
[71]
It was an all-metal aircraft with a tricycle
undercarriage
and conventional low, straight wings with mid-mounted turbojet engines and a high-mounted
tailplane
clear of the jet exhaust.
[Note 5]
[Note 6]
The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high
transonic
speeds, large trim changes, high
stick
forces and self-sustained yaw instability (snaking) caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces.
[73]
The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.
[74]
Later Meteor variants would see a large variety of changes from the initial Meteor F.1 introduced to service in 1944. Much attention was given to raising the aircraft's top speed, often by improving the airframe's aerodynamic qualities, incorporating the latest engine developments, and increasing the strength of the airframe.
[69]
[75]
The Meteor F.8, which emerged in the late 1940s, was considered to have substantially improved performance over prior variants;
[76]
the F.8 was reportedly the most powerful single-seat aircraft flying in 1947, capable of ascending to 40,000 feet (12,000 m) within five minutes.
[77]
Construction
[
edit
]
From the outset, each Meteor was constructed from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice to allow for production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport.
[78]
Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections.
[79]
The forward section contained the pressure cabin, gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The centre section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage. The rear fuselage was of a conventional semi-monocoque structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout the structure of the Meteor, such as the stressed
duralumin
skin.
[80]
Across the Meteor's production life, various different companies were subcontracted to manufacture aircraft sections and major components; due to the wartime workload on producing fighter aircraft such as the
Hawker Hurricane
and
Hawker Typhoon
, neither Gloster nor the wider
Hawker Siddeley Group
were able to internally meet the production demand of 80 aircraft per month.
[23]
Bristol Tramways
produced the forward fuselage of the aircraft, the
Standard Motor Company
manufactured the central fuselage and inner wing sections, the
Pressed Steel Company
produced the rear fuselage, and
Parnall Aircraft
made the tail unit.
[81]
Other main subcontractors included
Boulton Paul Aircraft
,
Excelsior Motor Radiator Company
,
Bell Punch
,
Turner Manufacturing Company
, and
Charlesworth Bodies
; as many of these firms had little or no experience producing aircraft, both quality and interchangeability of components were maintained by contractually enforced adherence to Gloster's original drawings.
[82]
From the Meteor F.4 onwards, Armstrong Whitworth began completing whole units at their
Coventry
facility in addition to Gloster's own production line.
[83]
Belgian aviation firm
Avions Fairey
also produced the Meteor F.8 under licence from Gloster for the
Belgian Air Force
; a similar licence manufacturing arrangement was made with Dutch company
Fokker
to meet the
Royal Netherlands Air Force
's order.
[84]
Engines
[
edit
]
Rolls-Royce Welland
engine on display. The rear of the engine is at the left.
The
Meteor F.1
was powered by two
Rolls-Royce Welland
turbojet engines, Britain's first production jet engines, which were built under licence from Whittle's designs.
[29]
The Meteor embodied the advent of practical jet propulsion; in the type's service life, both military and civil aviation manufacturers rapidly integrated turbine engines into their designs, favouring its advantages such as smoother running and greater power output.
[85]
The Meteor's engines were considerably more practical than those of the German Me 262 as, unlike the Me 262, the engines were embedded into the wing in nacelles between the front and rear spars rather than underslung, saving some weight due to shorter landing gear legs and less massive spars.
[86]
[Note 7]
The
W.2B/23C
engines upon which the Welland was based produced 1,700 lbf (7.6 kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417 mph (671 km/h) at 9,800 feet (3,000 m) and a range of 1,000 miles (1,600 km).
[42]
It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit.
[Note 8]
The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a
Rotol
gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar;
[29]
the cockpit was also heated by
bleed air
from one of the engines.
[80]
The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce
compressor stalls
early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself.
[88]
At high speeds the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.
[89]
Based upon designs produced by Power Jets, Rolls-Royce produced more advanced and powerful turbojet engines. Beyond numerous improvements made to the Welland engine that powered the early Meteors, Rolls-Royce and Power Jets collaborated to develop the more capable
Derwent
engine, which as the
Rover B.26
had undergone a radical re-design from the
W.2B/500
while at Rover. The Derwent engine, and the re-designed Derwent V based on the
Nene
, was installed on many of the later production Meteors; the adoption of this new powerplant led to considerable performance increases.
[29]
[86]
[Note 9]
The Meteor often served as the basis for the development of other early turbojet designs; a pair of Meteor F.4s were sent to Rolls-Royce to aid in their experimental engine trials,
RA435
being used for
reheat
testing, and
RA491
being fitted with the
Rolls-Royce Avon
, an axial-flow engine.
[29]
[91]
From their involvement in the development of the Meteor's engines,
Armstrong-Siddeley
,
Bristol Aircraft
,
Metropolitan-Vickers
, and
de Havilland
also independently developed their own gas turbine engines.
[92]
Performance
[
edit
]

Hawker Hunter
T7A at the
Cotswold Air Show
in 2009
During development, sceptical elements of the Air Ministry had expected mature piston-powered aircraft types to exceed the capabilities of the Meteor in all respects except that of speed; thus, the performance of early Meteors was considered favourable for the interceptor mission, being capable of out-diving the majority of enemy aircraft.
[93]
The conclusion of in-service trials conducted between the Meteor F.3. and the
Hawker Tempest V
was that the performance of the Meteor exceeded the Tempest in almost all respects and that, barring some manoeuvrability issues, the Meteor could be considered a capable all-round fighter.
[94]
Pilots formerly flying piston-engine aircraft often described the Meteor as being exciting to fly. British politician
Norman Tebbit
stated of his experience flying the Meteor in the RAF: "Get airborne, up with the wheels, hold it low until you were about 380 knots, pull it up and she would go up, well we thought then, like a rocket".
[95]
Early jet engines consumed a lot more fuel than the piston engines they replaced so the Welland engines imposed considerable flight-time limitations on the Meteor F.1, leading to the type being used for local interception duties only. In the post-war environment, there was considerable pressure to increase the range of interceptors to counter the threat of bombers armed with
nuclear weapons
.
[96]
The long-term answer to this question was
in-flight refuelling
; several Meteors were provided to
Flight Refuelling Limited
for trials of the newly developed
probe-and-drogue
refuelling techniques. This capability was not incorporated in service Meteors, which had already been supplanted by more modern interceptor aircraft at this point.
[97]
A total of 890 Meteors were lost in RAF service (145 of these crashes occurring in 1953 alone), resulting in the deaths of 450 pilots. Contributory factors in the number of crashes were the poor brakes, failure of the landing gear, the high fuel consumption and consequent short flight endurance (less than one hour) causing pilots to run out of fuel, and difficult handling with one engine out due to the widely set engines. The casualty rate was exacerbated by the lack of ejection seats in early series Meteors;
[98]
the much higher speed that the aircraft was capable of meant that to bail out pilots might have to overcome high
g forces
and fast-moving airflow past the cockpit; there was also a greater likelihood of the pilot striking the horizontal tailplane.
[99]
Ejection seats were fitted in the later F.8, FR.9, PR.10 and some experimental Meteors.
[100]
[101]
[
]
The difficulty of baling out of the Meteor had been noted by pilots during development, reporting several contributing design factors such as the limited size and relative position of the cockpit to the rest of the aircraft, and difficulty in using the two-lever jettisonable hood mechanism.
[102]
Operational service
[
edit
]
Second World War
[
edit
]
Meteor F.1 of No. 616 Squadron
No. 616 Squadron RAF
was the first to receive operational Meteors: a total of 14 aircraft were initially delivered. The squadron was based at
RAF Culmhead
,
Somerset
and had been equipped with the
Spitfire VII
.
[103]
The conversion to the Meteor was initially a matter of great secrecy.
[104]
Following a conversion course at
Farnborough
attended by the squadron's six leading pilots, the first aircraft was delivered to Culmhead on 12 July 1944.
[14]
[Note 10]
The squadron and its seven Meteors moved on 21 July 1944 to
RAF Manston
on the east
Kent
coast and, within a week, 32 pilots had been converted to the type.
[105]
The Meteor was initially used to counter the
V-1 flying bomb
threat. 616 Squadron Meteors saw action for the first time on 27 July 1944, when three aircraft were active over Kent. These were the first operational jet combat missions for the Meteor and for the Royal Air Force. After some problems, especially with jamming guns, the first two V-1 "kills" were made on 4 August.
[106]
By war's end, Meteors had accounted for 14 flying bombs.
[107]
After the end of the V-1 threat, and the introduction of the ballistic
V-2 rocket
, the RAF was forbidden to fly the Meteor on combat missions over German-held territory for fear of an aircraft being shot down and salvaged by the Germans.
No. 616 Squadron briefly moved to
RAF Debden
to allow
United States Army Air Forces
(USAAF) bomber crews to gain experience and create tactics in facing jet-engined foes before moving to
Colerne
,
Wiltshire
. For a week from 10 October 1944 a series of exercises were carried out in which a flight of Meteors made mock attacks on a formation of 100 B-24s and B-17s escorted by 40 Mustangs and Thunderbolts. These suggested that, if the jet fighter attacked the formation from above, it could take advantage of its superior speed in the dive to attack the bombers and then escape by diving through the formation before the escorts could react. The best tactic to counter this was to place a fighter screen 5,000 ft above the bombers and attempt to intercept the jets early in the dive.
[108]
The exercise was also useful from No. 616 Squadron's perspective, giving valuable practical experience in Meteor operations.
[109]
Meteor F.3s with original short engine nacelles
No. 616 Squadron exchanged its F.1s for the first
Meteor F.3
s on 18 December 1944. These first 15 F.3s differed from the F.1 in having a sliding canopy in place of the sideways hinging canopy, increased fuel capacity and some airframe refinements. They were still powered by Welland I engines.
[110]
Later F.3s were equipped with the Derwent I engines. This was a substantial improvement over the earlier mark, although the basic design still had not reached its potential.
Wind tunnel
and flight tests demonstrated that the original short
nacelles
, which did not extend far fore and aft of the wing, contributed heavily to compressibility buffeting at high speed. New, longer nacelles not only cured some of the compressibility problems but added 75 miles per hour (120 km/h) at altitude, even without upgraded powerplants. The last batch of Meteor F.3s featured the longer nacelles; other F.3s were retrofitted in the field with the new nacelles. The F.3 also had the new
Rolls-Royce Derwent
engines, increased fuel capacity, and a new larger, more strongly raked
bubble canopy
.
[53]
Judging the
Meteor F.3
s were ready for combat over Europe, the RAF finally decided to deploy them on the continent. On 20 January 1945, four Meteors from 616 Squadron were moved to
Melsbroek
in Belgium and attached to the
Second Tactical Air Force
,
[111]
just under three weeks after the Luftwaffe's surprise
Unternehmen Bodenplatte
attack on New Year's Day, in which Melsbroek's RAF base, designated as Allied
Advanced Landing Ground
"B.58", had been struck by piston-engined fighters of
JG 27
and
JG 54
. The 616 Squadron Meteor F.3s' initial purpose was to provide air defence for the airfield, but their pilots hoped that their presence might provoke the Luftwaffe into sending
Me 262
jets against them.
[103]
At this point the Meteor pilots were still forbidden to fly over German-occupied territory, or to go east of Eindhoven, to prevent a downed aircraft being captured by the Germans or the Soviets.

In March, the entire squadron was moved to
Gilze-Rijen Air Base
and then in April, to
Nijmegen
. The Meteors flew armed
reconnaissance
and ground attack operations without encountering any German jet fighters. By late April, the squadron was based at
Faßberg
,
Germany
and suffered its first losses when two aircraft collided in poor visibility. The war ended with the Meteors having destroyed 46 German aircraft through ground attack.

Friendly fire
through misidentification as Messerschmitt Me 262s by Allied anti-aircraft gunners was more of a threat than the already-diminished forces of the Luftwaffe; to counter this, continental-based Meteors were given an all-white finish as a recognition aid.

Post-war
[

The next-generation
Meteor F.4
prototype first flew on 17 May 1945, and went into production in 1946 when 16 RAF squadrons were already operating Meteors.
[113]
Equipped with
Rolls-Royce Derwent
5 engines, the smaller version of the
Nene
, the F.4 was 170 mph (270 km/h) faster than the F.1 at sea level (585 against 415), but the reduced wings impaired its rate of climb.
[114]
[Note 11]
The F.4 wingspan was 86.4 cm shorter than the F.3 and with blunter wing tips, derived from the world speed record prototypes. Improvements included a strengthened airframe,
fully pressurised cockpit
, lighter
ailerons
to improve manoeuvrability, and
rudder
trim adjustments
to reduce
snaking
. The F.4 could be fitted with a drop tank under each wing, and experiments were carried out with carriage of
underwing stores
and also in lengthened
fuselage
models.
Because of increased demand, F.4 production was divided between Gloster and Armstrong Whitworth. The majority of early F.4s did not go to the RAF: 100 were exported to Argentina, seeing action on both sides in the
1955 revolution
;
[115]
in 1947, only RAF Nos. 74 and 222 squadrons were fully equipped with the F.4. Nine further RAF squadrons converted from 1948 onwards. From 1948, 38 F.4s were exported to the Dutch, equipping four squadrons (322, 323, 326 and 327) split between bases in
Soesterberg
and
Leeuwarden
until the mid-1950s. In 1949, only two RAF squadrons were converted to the F.4, Belgium was sold 48 aircraft in the same year (going to 349 and 350 squadrons at
Beauvechain
) and Denmark received 20 over 1949-1950. In 1950, three more RAF squadrons were upgraded, including No. 616 and, in 1951, six more.
WA742, a two-seat Meteor T7 in 1961
A modified two-seater F.4 for jet-conversion and advanced training was tested in 1949 as the
T.7
. It was accepted by the RAF and the
Fleet Air Arm
and became a common addition to the various export packages (for example 43 to Belgium between 1948 and 1957, a similar number to the Netherlands over the same period, two to Syria in 1952, six to Israel in 1953, etc.). Despite its limitations - unpressurised cockpit, no armament, limited instructor instrumentation - more than 650 T.7s were manufactured.
[116]
[117]
The T.7 remained in RAF service into the 1970s.
[118]
As improved jet fighters emerged, Gloster decided to modernise the F.4 while retaining as much of the manufacturing tooling as possible. The result was the definitive production model, the
Meteor F.8
(G-41-K), serving as a major RAF fighter until the introduction of the
Hawker Hunter
and the
Supermarine Swift
. The first prototype F.8 was a modified F.4, followed by a true prototype,
VT150
, that flew on 12 October 1948 at
Moreton Valence
.
[119]
Flight testing of the F.8 prototype led to the discovery of an aerodynamic problem: after ammunition was expended, the aircraft became tail-heavy and unstable around the pitch axis due to the weight of fuel in fuselage tanks no longer being balanced by the ammunition. Gloster solved the problem by substituting the
tail
of the abortive
G 42
single-engined jet fighter. The F.8 and other production variants successfully used the new tail design, giving the later Meteors a distinctive appearance, with taller straighter edges compared with the rounded tail of the F.4s and earlier marks.
[120]
Meteor F.8 at the Danish Flight Museum, 2006
The F.8 also featured a fuselage stretch of 76 cm (30 in), intended to shift the aircraft's
centre of gravity
and also eliminate the use of
ballast
formerly necessary in earlier marks due to the subsequent elimination from the design of two of the originally designed six installed cannon. The F.8 incorporated uprated engines, Derwent 8s, with 3,600 lbf (16 kN) thrust each combined with structural strengthening, a
Martin Baker
ejection seat
and a "blown" teardrop cockpit canopy that provided improved pilot visibility.
[121]
Between 1950 and 1955, the Meteor F.8 was the mainstay of
RAF Fighter Command
, and served with distinction in
combat in Korea
with the RAAF as well as operating with many air forces worldwide, although it was clear that the original design was obsolete compared with contemporary swept-wing fighters such as the
North American F-86 Sabre
and the
Soviet
MiG-15
.
[122]
Initial deliveries of the F.8 to the RAF were in August 1949, with the first squadron receiving its fighters in late 1950. Like the F.4, there were strong export sales of the F.8. Belgium ordered 240 aircraft, the majority assembled in The Netherlands by Fokker. The Netherlands had 160 F.8s, equipping seven squadrons until 1955. Denmark had 20, ordered in 1951, the last F.8s in front-line service in Europe. The RAAF ordered 94 F.8s, which served in the Korean War. Despite arms embargoes, both Syria and Egypt received F.8s from 1952, as did Israel, each using their Meteors during the Suez Crisis. Brazil ordered 60 new Meteor F.8s and 10 T.7 trainers in October 1952, paying with 15,000 tons of raw cotton.
[123]
In the 1950s, Meteors were developed into effective photo-
reconnaissance
,
training
and
night fighter
versions. The fighter reconnaissance (FR) versions were the first to be built, replacing the ageing Spitfires and
Mosquitos
then in use. Two
FR.5
s were built on the F.4 body; one was used for nose section camera tests, the other broke up in midair while in testing over Moreton Valence. On 23 March 1950, the first
FR.9
flew. Based on the F.8, it was 20 cm longer with a new nose incorporating a remote control camera and window and was also fitted with additional external ventral and wing fuel tanks. Production of the FR.9 began in July. No. 208 Squadron, then based at Fayid, Egypt was the first to be upgraded followed by the 2nd Tactical Air Force in
West Germany
,
No. 2 Squadron RAF
at
Bückeburg
and
No. 79 Squadron RAF
at
RAF Gutersloh
flew the FR.9 from 1951 until 1956. In
Aden
,
No. 8 Squadron RAF
was given FR.9s in November 1958 and used them until 1961.
[124]
Ecuador (12), Israel (7) and Syria (2) were foreign customers for the FR.9.
[125]
In 1951,
29
,
141
,
85
and
264 squadrons
each received a number of NF.11 aircraft, the first of the Meteor night fighters.
[126]
It was rolled out across the RAF until the final deliveries in 1954.
[127]
A "tropicalised" version of the NF.11 for the Middle East was developed; first flying on 23 December 1952 as the
NF.13
. The aircraft equipped
No. 219 Squadron RAF
at
Kabrit
and No. 39 Squadron at Fayid, both in Egypt. The aircraft served during the
Suez crisis
and remained with No. 39 Squadron after they were withdrawn to Malta until 1958. Several problems were encountered: the heavily framed T.7 canopy made landings tricky due to limited visibility, the under-wing external fuel tanks tended to break up when the wing cannons were fired, and gun harmonisation, normally set to about 400 yards, was poor due to the wings flexing in flight. Belgium (24), Denmark (20) and France (41) were foreign customers for the NF.11.
[128]
Ex-RAF NF.13s were sold to France (two), Syria (six), Egypt (six) and Israel (six).
[129]
In addition to the armed, low altitude operation, tactical FR.9 variant, Gloster also developed the
PR.10
for high altitude missions.
[130]
The first prototype flew on 29 March 1950 and was actually converted into the first production aircraft. Based on the F.4, it had the F.4-style tail and the longer wings of the earlier variant. All the cannons were removed and a single camera placed in the nose with two more in the rear fuselage; the canopy was also changed. The PR.10 was delivered to the RAF in December 1950 and were given to No. 2 and No. 541 squadrons in Germany and
No. 13 Squadron RAF
in Cyprus. The PR.10 was rapidly phased out from 1956; rapid improvements in
surface-to-air missile
technology and the introduction of newer aircraft capable of flying at greater altitudes and speeds had rendered the aircraft obsolete.

Argentina became the first overseas operator of the Meteor, placing an order for 100 F Mk.4s in May 1947.
[131]
The Meteor's procurement led to Argentina becoming the second air force in the Americas to operate jet aircraft.
[

The Argentine Meteors were first used in combat during the 16 June 1955 rebellion when, in an attempt to kill
Juan Perón
,
rebel-flown aircraft bombed
the
Casa Rosada
. A loyalist Meteor shot down a rebel
AT-6
, while another strafed rebel-held
Ezeiza airport
. The rebels seized
Morón Airport and Air Base
, base of the Meteors, and used several captured aircraft to perform multiple attacks against loyalist forces and the Casa Rosada before the rebellion was defeated by day's end.
[132]
A second revolt, the
Revolución Libertadora
broke out on 16 September 1955, with, again, both sides operating the Meteor. The rebels seized three Meteors. Government Meteors flew strafing attacks against the rebel-held destroyers
Rioja
and
Cervantes
, and several landing ships near
Rio Santiago
on 16 September and attacking
Pajas Blancas
airport near the city of
Córdoba
, damaging several
Avro Lincoln
bombers. The rebel-flown Meteors were used to attack loyalist forces attacking Córdoba, losing one of their number on 19 September to an engine failure caused by use of
automobile petrol
instead of
jet fuel
.
[133]
The acquisition of
North American F-86 Sabres
in 1960 allowed the remaining Meteors to be transferred to the ground attack role. In this role, the aircraft were refitted with bomb pylons and rocket rails; the bare metal colour scheme was also discarded for a camouflage scheme.
[134]
[135]
Argentine Meteors were used to attack rebels during attempted uprisings in September 1962 and April 1963.
[136]
The type was ultimately withdrawn from service in 1970.
[135]
Australia
[

No. 77 Squadron RAAF pilots and Meteor aircraft in Korea, c. 1952.
The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) acquired 113 Meteors between 1946 and 1952, 94 of which were the F.8 variant.
[137]
The first RAAF Meteor was an F.3 delivered for evaluation in June 1946.
[138]
[Note 12]
Australia's F.8s saw extensive service during the
Korean War
with
No. 77 Squadron RAAF
, part of
British Commonwealth Forces Korea
. The squadron had personnel from the RAF and other Commonwealth air forces attached to it. It had arrived in Korea equipped with piston-engined
Mustangs
. To match the threat posed by
MiG-15
jet fighters, it was decided to reequip the squadron with Meteors.
[138]
[140]
Jet conversion training was conducted at Iwakuni, Japan, after which the squadron returned to the Korean theatre in April 1951 with about 30 Meteor F.8s and T.7s. The squadron moved to
Kimpo Air Base
in June, and was declared combat ready the following month.
[141]
More advanced designs, such as the F-86 Sabre and
Hawker P.1081
, were considered but would not be available within a realistic time frame; the Meteor proved to be considerably inferior in combat against the MiG-15 in several respects, including speed and manoeuvrability at high altitude.
[142]
On 29 July 1951, 77 Squadron began operating their Meteors on combat missions. The squadron had mainly been trained for
ground attack
and had difficulty when assigned to bomber escort duty at sub-optimum altitudes. On 29 August 1951, eight Meteors were on escort duty in "
MiG Alley
" when they were engaged by six MiG-15s; one Meteor was lost and two were damaged.
[143]
[Note 13]
On 27 October, the squadron achieved its first probable followed by two probables six days later.
[144]
On 1 December the
Battle of Sunchon
took place between 14 Meteors and at least 20 MiG-15s - in North Korean markings but operated secretly by the elite Soviet 176th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (176 GIAP). The Australians lost three Meteors, with one pilot killed and two captured,
[145]
while claiming one MiG destroyed and one damaged. Russian records and accounts, which became public after the end of the Cold War, suggested that no MiGs from 176 GIAP were lost.
[146]

Kimpo air base
(K-14) during the Korean War.
At the end of 1951, due to the superiority of the MiGs in air combat - as well as the Meteor's favourable low-level performance and sturdy construction, RAAF commanders had 77 Squadron returned to ground-attack.
[145]
In February 1952, more than a thousand ground-attack sorties were flown and these continued until May 1952, when 77 Squadron switched to fighter sweeps. The last encounter between the Meteor and the MiG-15 was in March 1953, during which a Meteor piloted by Sergeant John Hale recorded a victory.
[147]
By the end of the conflict, the squadron had flown 4,836 missions, destroying six MiG-15s, over 3,500 structures and some 1,500 vehicles. About 30 Meteors were lost to enemy action in Korea, the vast majority shot down by anti-aircraft fire on ground-attack operations.
[137]
The RAAF began introducing the locally-built
CAC Sabre
powered by the
Rolls-Royce Avon
, in 1955, which relegated Meteors to training and secondary duties. A number of Meteors would be assigned to the reserve
Citizen Air Force
, while others were configured as pilotless drone aircraft or for target towing.
No. 75 Squadron RAAF
was the last Australian squadron to operate the Meteor; notably, it had operated a three-unit aerobatic team, named "The Meteorites".
[148]
[149]
Egypt
[
edit
]
Although Egypt's first order for the Meteor was placed in 1948, the rising tension in the region led to the imposition of a series of arms embargoes. Twelve F Mk.4s were eventually delivered between October 1949 and May 1950,
[150]
along with three T Mk.7s.
[151]
Twenty-four F Mk.8s were ordered in 1949, but this order was stopped by an embargo. A further order for 12 ex-RAF F.8s was placed in December 1952, of which four were delivered before the order was cancelled, with the final eight being delivered in 1955,
[152]
along with three more T Mk.7s.
[151]
and six NF Mk.13s, all ex-RAF aircraft.
[153]
Britain had allowed the Meteor sales as part of an effort to foster and support good relations; tensions over the
Suez Canal
led to arms sales being suspended once again.
[154]
Egyptian Meteors participated in the fighting during the Suez Crisis of 1956, typically being used in ground attack missions against Israeli forces.
[155]
[156]
In one incident, an Egyptian Meteor NF Mk.13 claimed to have damaged an RAF
Vickers Valiant
bomber.
[157]
An aerial bombing campaign of Egyptian airfields by Anglo-French forces resulted in several aircraft being destroyed on the ground; the Egyptian Air Force subsequently withdrew from combat within the
Sinai
region.
[158]
[159]
Syria
[
edit
]
Meteors were the first jet aircraft of the fledgling
Syrian Air Force
. It acquired 25 of them between 1952 and 1956.
[160]
Although the British were willing to supply aircraft, they did not supply combat training or radar. As Syria became more aligned with
Gamal Abdel Nasser
and Egypt, British support for Meteor operations was withdrawn and Syrian pilots began training with their Egyptian counterparts.
[

]
During the Suez Crisis, the RAF performed high altitude reconnaissance flights over Syria by
English Electric Canberra
aircraft from bases in Cyprus. Lacking radar to track the aircraft, the Syrian Air Force developed a ground spotter network that reported information by telephone to intercept the flights. On 6 November 1956, a Syrian Meteor shot down a Canberra of
No. 13 Squadron RAF
, which crashed in Lebanon.
[161]
In 1957, Syria began to replace its Meteors with new
MiG-17s
from the Soviet Union.

France
[
edit
]
The
French Air Force
was keen to acquire jet aircraft as part of its re-equipment program following the Second World War. In 1953, 25 new-build aircraft were diverted from RAF orders to fulfil a French order; a further 16 ex-RAF NF.11s were purchased in 1954 and delivered between September 1954 and April 1955,
[162]
these being supplemented by about 14 T Mk.7s.
[163]
The NF Mk.11s replaced the Mosquito night fighter with the Escadre de Chasse (EC) 30, serving with that Wing until replaced by the
Sud Aviation Vautour
in 1957. Several Meteors were then transferred to ECN 1/7 in Algeria, which saw combat in the
Algerian War
, operating from
Bône
, while others were used for training Vautour night fighter crews. The Vautour was retired from French Air Force service in 1964.
[164]
[165]
Five Meteor NF.11s were transferred to the Centre d’Essais en Vol (Flight Test Centre) in 1958, where they were used as equipment testbeds and chase planes,
[165]
and were later joined by two NF Mk.13s and two NF Mk.14s.
[129]
[166]
The test aircraft were used in a wide variety of experiments, including radar and missile tests and during the development of
Concorde
.
[167]
Israel
[
edit
]
Israeli Air Force
Meteor in 1954
Due to tensions between the newly formed nation of Israel and its neighbours, both sides had commenced an arms race which led to jet aircraft being vigorously purchased by various countries in the region. In 1953 Israel ordered four
T Mk.7
s and 11
F Mk.8
s, with delivery continuing until early 1954. The
F Mk.8s
were modified to carry American HVAR rockets but were otherwise identical to RAF aircraft.
[168]
A second batch of seven refurbished
FR Mk.9s
and two more
T Mk.7s
was delivered in 1955.
[169]
In 1956, Israel purchased six NF Mk.13s, with three delivered that year, and the remaining three, delayed by an arms embargo, in 1958.
[170]
Five more T Mk.7s were later purchased, these were converted from ex-Belgian
F Mk.4
s and were fitted with the
Mk.8
tail.
[171]
[172]
On 1 September 1955, an Israeli Meteor shot down an Egyptian
de Havilland Vampire
, the first jet aircraft to be shot down in the theatre.
[173]
The Meteor played a key role during the Suez Crisis; on 28 October 1956, an Israeli NF.13 took part in
Operation Tarnegol
, in which it successfully located and shot down an Egyptian
Ilyushin Il-14
that had been carrying several high-ranking Egyptian military officers on the eve of the crisis.
[174]
The operation had intended to shoot down the Il-14 that was supposed to be carrying the supreme commander of the Egyptian armed forces,
Abdel Hakim Amer
, however a different aircraft had been inadvertently attacked and destroyed instead.
[159]
After deploying paratroopers east of the
Suez Canal
, the
Israeli Air Force
continued to support them on the ground predominantly using its jet aircraft, fearing its propeller-driven aircraft would be vulnerable against Egypt's jet fighters.
[159]
While initially flying
combat air patrol
missions, the Meteors and other Israeli aircraft could not prevent effective attacks by Egyptian aircraft on the ground forces.
[159]
Israeli officers came to recognise that the Meteor was outclassed by Egyptian MiG-15s, and subsequently limited the Meteor's employment as a fighter against other aerial adversaries.
[

]
Following the start of the Anglo-French bombing campaign against Egyptian airbases, the Egyptian Air Force mostly withdrew from combat in the
Sinai
, allowing Israeli aircraft to operate unhindered.
[159]
The Mk.8s remained in front line service until 1956, and were then used as training aircraft. The NF Mk.13s remained in operational use until 1962.
[175]
Record setting

]
The Sapphire Meteor WA820 on display at
Farnborough Airshow
, 1951
Late in 1945, two F.3 Meteors were modified for an attempt on the world
air speed record
. On 7 November 1945 at
Herne Bay in Kent
, UK, Group Captain
Hugh "Willie" Wilson
set the first official air speed record by a jet aircraft of 606 mph (975 km/h)
TAS
.
[176]
[177]
In 1946,
Group Captain
Edward "Teddy" Donaldson
broke this record with a speed of 616 mph (991 km/h)
TAS
, in
EE549
, a Meteor F.4.

[178]
On 4-5 April 1950, Sqn Ldr
Janusz Żurakowski
set an international speed record London-Copenhagen-London in a production standard F.8 (
VZ468
). Suitably impressed, the Danes later purchased the type.
[179]
Another "claim to fame" was the Meteor's ability to perform the "
Zurabatic Cartwheel
", an aerobatics manoeuvre named after Gloster's acting Chief Test Pilot, it was first demonstrated by Meteor
G-7-1
G-AMCJ
prototype at the 1951 Farnborough Air Show;
[180]
the Meteor, due to its widely set engines, could have individual engines throttled back and forward to achieve a seemingly stationary vertical cartwheel. Many Meteor pilots went on to "prove their mettle" by attempting the same feat.
[181]
On 7 August 1949, the Meteor III,
EE397
, on loan from the RAF and flown by
Flight Refuelling Ltd
(FRL)
test pilot
Patrick Hornidge, took off from
Tarrant Rushton
and, refuelled 10 times by the Lancaster tanker, remained airborne for 12 hours and 3 minutes, receiving 2,352 imperial gallons (10,690 L) of fuel from the tanker in ten tanker contacts and flying an overall distance of 3,600 miles (5,800 km), achieving a new jet endurance record.
[182]
Meteor F.8
WA820
was adapted during 1948 to take two
Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire
turbojets, and from Moreton Valence, on 31 August 1951, established a time-to-height climb record. The pilot was
Flt Lt
Tom Prickett, of
Armstrong Siddeley
. A height of 9,843 ft was reached in 1 min 16 sec, 19,685 ft in 1 min 50 sec, 29,500 ft in 2 min 29 sec, and 39,370 ft in 3 min 7 sec.

A
Migrant Resource Centre
or
MRC
is an Australian community-based organisation  that provides settlement services for
migrants
and
refugees
. The main purpose of MRCs is to cater to the immediate and longer term needs of migrants and refugees to facilitate successful integration into their local community and enable them to reach their full potential. MRC's provide information and referral services and assistance with finding and keeping employment to newly arrived migrants and refugees. MRCs also provide services for aged and disabled members of ethnic communities who prefer to access ethno-specific services. Many MRCs also conduct research and consultancy on a range of cultural and community issues.
MRCs are limited by the terms of their funding and can only provide services to holders of certain categories of visa that allow them to access their services. Most
asylum seekers
are ineligible to access these services, along with most other government health, housing, community or employment services. There are a small number of specialist asylum seeker services that have been set up to cater to the needs of these highly marginalised people.

and could use the infrastructure that was built for the tournament.

In September 2022, South Africa announced its bid to host the 2027 women's edition.

The
Manhattan Project
was a program of research and development undertaken during
World War II
to produce the first
nuclear weapons
. It was led by the
United States
in collaboration with the
United Kingdom
and with support from
Canada
. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General
Leslie Groves
of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
. Nuclear physicist
J. Robert Oppenheimer
was the director of the
Los Alamos Laboratory
that designed the bombs. The Army component was designated the
Manhattan District
, as its first headquarters were in
Manhattan
; the name gradually superseded the official codename,
Development of Substitute Materials
, for the entire project. The project absorbed its earlier British counterpart,
Tube Alloys
. The Manhattan Project grew rapidly and employed nearly 130,000 people at its peak and cost nearly US$2 billion (equivalent to about $24 billion in 2021).
[1]
Over 90 percent of the cost was for building factories and to produce
fissile material
, with less than 10 percent for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
The project led to the development of two types of atomic bombs, both developed concurrently, during the war: a relatively simple
gun-type fission weapon
and a more complex
implosion-type nuclear weapon
. The
Thin Man
gun-type design proved impractical to use with
plutonium
, so a simpler gun-type design called
Little Boy
was developed that used
uranium-235
. Three methods were employed for
uranium enrichment
:
electromagnetic
,
gaseous
and
thermal
. In parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, the
Chicago Pile-1
, was demonstrated in 1942 at the
Metallurgical Laboratory
in the
University of Chicago
, the project designed the
X-10 Graphite Reactor
and the production reactors at the
Hanford Site
, in which uranium was irradiated and
transmuted
into plutonium. The
Fat Man
plutonium implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.
The project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the
German nuclear weapon project
. Through
Operation Alsos
, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet
atomic spies
successfully penetrated the program.
The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb during the
Trinity test
, conducted at New Mexico's
Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range
on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
, respectively, with Manhattan Project personnel serving as bomb assembly technicians and weaponeers on the attack aircraft. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at
Bikini Atoll
as part of
Operation Crossroads
, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of
national laboratories
, supported medical research into
radiology
and laid the foundations for the
nuclear navy
. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the
United States Atomic Energy Commission
(UNAEC) in January 1947.
Origins
For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of the Manhattan Project
.
The
discovery of nuclear fission
by German chemists
Otto Hahn
and
Fritz Strassmann
in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by
Lise Meitner
and
Otto Frisch
, made the development of an
atomic bomb
a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a
German atomic bomb project
would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from
Nazi Germany
and other
fascist
countries.
[2]
In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists
Leo Szilard
and
Eugene Wigner
drafted the
Einstein-Szilard letter
, which warned of the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". It urged the United States to acquire stockpiles of
uranium ore
and accelerate the research of
Enrico Fermi
and others into
nuclear chain reactions
.
[3]
They had it signed by
Albert Einstein
and delivered to President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
. Roosevelt called on
Lyman Briggs
of the
National Bureau of Standards
to head the
Advisory Committee on Uranium
to investigate the issues; Briggs met with Szilárd, Wigner and
Edward Teller
in October 1939.
[3]
The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium "would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known."
[4]
Enrico Fermi
,
John R. Dunning
, and Dana P. Mitchell in front of the cyclotron in the basement of
Pupin Hall
at
Columbia University
, 1940
In February 1940, the
U.S. Navy
awarded
Columbia University
$6,000 in funding,
[5]
most of which Fermi and Szilard spent on
graphite
. A team of Columbia professors including Fermi, Szilard,
Eugene T. Booth
and
John Dunning
created the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas, verifying the work of Hahn and Strassmann. The same team subsequently built a series of prototype
nuclear reactors
(or "piles" as Fermi called them) in
Pupin Hall
at Columbia but were not yet able to achieve a chain reaction.
[6]
The Advisory Committee on Uranium became the
National Defense Research Committee
(NDRC) on Uranium when that organization was formed on 27 June 1940.
[7]
Briggs proposed spending $167,000 on research into uranium, particularly the
uranium-235
isotope, and
plutonium
, which was discovered in 1940 at the
University of California
.
[8]
[note 1]
On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the
Office of Scientific Research and Development
(OSRD),
[11]
with
Vannevar Bush
as its director. The office was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research.
[8]
The NDRC Committee on Uranium became the S-1 Section of the OSRD; the word "uranium" was dropped for security reasons.
[12]
In Britain, Frisch and
Rudolf Peierls
at the
University of Birmingham
had made a breakthrough investigating the
critical mass
of uranium-235 in June 1939.
[13]
Their calculations indicated that it was within an
order of magnitude
of 10 kilograms (22 lb), which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day.
[14]
Their March 1940
Frisch-Peierls memorandum
initiated the British atomic bomb project and its
MAUD Committee
,
[15]
which unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb.
[14]
In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its research,
[16]
and the
Tizard Mission
's
John Cockcroft
briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as advanced.
[17]
As part of the scientific exchange, the MAUD Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist
Mark Oliphant
, flew to the US in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the MAUD Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited
Berkeley, California
, where he spoke persuasively to
Ernest O. Lawrence
. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to
James B. Conant
,
Arthur H. Compton
and
George B. Pegram
. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.
[18]
[19]
On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt approved the atomic program after he convened a meeting with Vannevar Bush and Vice President
Henry A. Wallace
. He created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant,
Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson
, and the
Chief of Staff of the Army
,
General
George C. Marshall
. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction. He agreed to coordinate the effort with that of the British and on 11 October sent a message to Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.
[20]
Feasibility
Proposals
March 1940 meeting at Berkeley, California:
Ernest O. Lawrence
,
Arthur H. Compton
,
Vannevar Bush
,
James B. Conant
,
Karl T. Compton
, and
Alfred L. Loomis
The S-1 Committee meeting on 18 December 1941 was "pervaded by an atmosphere of enthusiasm and urgency"
[21]
in the wake of the
attack on Pearl Harbor
and the
United States declaration of war on Japan
and
on Germany
.
[22]
Work was proceeding on three techniques for
isotope separation
: Lawrence and his team at the
University of California
investigated
electromagnetic separation
,
Eger Murphree
and
Jesse Wakefield Beams
's team looked into
gaseous diffusion
at
Columbia University
, and
Philip Abelson
directed research into
thermal diffusion
at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington
and later the
Naval Research Laboratory
.
[23]
Murphree also headed an unsuccessful separation project using
gas centrifuges
.
[24]
Meanwhile, there were two lines of investigation into
nuclear reactor technology
:
Harold Urey
researched
heavy water
at Columbia, while Arthur Compton organized the
Metallurgical Laboratory
in early 1942 to study plutonium and reactors using
graphite
as a
neutron moderator
.
[25]
The S-1 Committee recommended pursuing all five technologies. This was approved by Bush, Conant, and
Brigadier General
Wilhelm D. Styer
, who had been designated the Army's representative on nuclear matters.
[23]
Bush and Conant then took the recommendation to the Top Policy Group with a budget proposal for $54 million for construction by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers
, $31 million for research and development by OSRD and $5 million for contingencies in fiscal year 1943. They sent it on 17 June 1942, to the President, who approved it by writing "OK FDR" on the document.
[23]
Bomb design concepts
Different fission bomb assembly methods explored during the July 1942 conference
Compton asked theoretical physicist
J. Robert Oppenheimer
of the University of California to take over research into
fast neutron calculations
—key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from
Gregory Breit
, who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security.
[26]
John H. Manley
, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country.
[27]
Oppenheimer and
Robert Serber
of the
University of Illinois
examined the problems of
neutron
diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and
hydrodynamics
—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave.
[28]
To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California in July 1942 with theoretical physicists
Hans Bethe
,
John Van Vleck
, Edward Teller,
Emil Konopinski
, Robert Serber,
Stan Frankel
, and Eldred C. (Carlyle) Nelson, and
experimental physicists
Emilio Segrè
,
Felix Bloch
,
Franco Rasetti
, Manley, and
Edwin McMillan
. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.
[29]
The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, which had only been discovered in February 1941 by
Glenn Seaborg
and his team. The scientists at the July 1942 Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from
cyclotrons
.
[30]
Even by December 1943, only two milligrams had been produced.
[31]
There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a "cylindrical plug" into a sphere of "active material" with a "tamper"—dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency.
[32]
They also explored designs involving
spheroids
, a primitive form of "
implosion
" suggested by
Richard C. Tolman
, and the possibility of
autocatalytic methods
, which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded.
[33]
As the idea of the fission bomb was theoretically settled—at least until more experimental data was available—Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the "super", now usually referred to as a "
hydrogen bomb
", which would use the force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a
nuclear fusion
reaction in
deuterium
and
tritium
.
[34]
Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one. The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs.
[35]
Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might "ignite" the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei.
[note 2]
Bethe calculated that it could not happen,
[37]
and a report co-authored by Teller showed that "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started."
[38]
In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned the possibility of this scenario to
Arthur Compton
, who "didn't have enough sense to shut up about it. It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" and was "never laid to rest".
[note 3]
Organization
Manhattan District
The
Chief of Engineers
, Major General
Eugene Reybold
, selected Colonel
James C. Marshall
to head the Army's part of the project in June 1942. Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters at
270 Broadway
in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers'
North Atlantic Division
. It was close to the Manhattan office of
Stone & Webster
, the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University. He had permission to draw on his former command, the Syracuse District, for staff, and he started with
Lieutenant Colonel
Kenneth Nichols
, who became his deputy.
[40]
[41]
The Manhattan Project Organizational Chart, 1 May 1946
Because most of his task involved construction, Marshall worked in cooperation with the head of the Corps of Engineers Construction Division, Major General
Thomas M. Robbins
, and his deputy, Colonel
Leslie Groves
. Reybold, Somervell, and Styer decided to call the project "Development of Substitute Materials", but Groves felt that this would draw attention. Since engineer districts normally carried the name of the city where they were located, Marshall and Groves agreed to name the Army's component the Manhattan District; Reybold officially created this district on 13 August. Informally, it was known as the Manhattan Engineer District, or MED. Unlike other districts, it had no geographic boundaries, and Marshall had the authority of a division engineer. Development of Substitute Materials remained as the official codename of the project as a whole but was supplanted over time by "Manhattan".
[41]
[42]
Marshall later conceded that, "I had never heard of atomic fission but I did know that you could not build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90 million."
[43]
A single
TNT
plant that Nichols had recently built in Pennsylvania had cost $128 million.
[44]
Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests.
[45]
A
survey team
from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The
War Production Board
recommended sites around
Knoxville, Tennessee
, an isolated area where the
Tennessee Valley Authority
could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near
Elza, Tennessee
. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments.
[46]
Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.
[47]
Marshall and Nichols began assembling the resources they would need. The first step was to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel
Lucius D. Clay
, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose.
[48]
Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.
[49]
Military Policy Committee
Oppenheimer
and Groves at the remains of the
Trinity test
in September 1945, two months after the test blast and just after the end of World War II. The white overshoes prevented fallout from sticking to the soles of their shoes.
[50]
Vannevar Bush became dissatisfied with Colonel Marshall's failure to get the project moving forward expeditiously
[51]
and felt that more aggressive leadership was required. He spoke to
Harvey Bundy
and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns, advocating that the project be placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as director.
[49]
Somervell and Styer selected Groves for the post; General Marshall ordered that he be promoted to brigadier general,
[52]
as it was felt that the title "general" would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the project.
[53]
Groves' orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Colonel Marshall now answerable to Groves.
[54]
Groves established his headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the
New War Department Building
, where Colonel Marshall had his liaison office.
[55]
He assumed command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. Later that day, he attended a meeting called by Stimson, which established a Military Policy Committee, responsible to the Top Policy Group, consisting of Bush (with Conant as an alternate), Styer and
Rear Admiral
William R. Purnell
.
[52]
Tolman and Conant were later appointed as Groves' scientific advisers.
[56]
On 19 September, Groves went to
Donald Nelson
, the chairman of the War Production Board, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President.
[57]
Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944.
[58]
According to Groves, "In Washington you became aware of the importance of top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority".
[59]
One of Groves' early problems was to find a director for
Project Y
, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were
communists
, including his wife,
Kitty
; his girlfriend,
Jean Tatlock
; and his brother,
Frank
. A long conversation in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.
[60]
[61]
Collaboration with the United Kingdom
Main article:
British contribution to the Manhattan Project
The British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project (
Tube Alloys
) because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb. But the British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, did not have the resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival; Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart.
[62]
The roles of the two countries were reversed,
[63]
and in January 1943 Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas.
[64]
[65]
The British investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program but determined that it could not be ready in time to impact the
war in Europe
.
[66]
Groves confers with
James Chadwick
, the head of the British Mission.
By March 1943 Conant decided that
James Chadwick
and one or two other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.
[67]
In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the
Quebec Agreement
,
[68]
[69]
which was extended to the postwar period by the Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944.
[70]
The Quebec Agreement established the
Combined Policy Committee
to coordinate the efforts of the US, UK and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir
John Dill
and Colonel
J. J. Llewellin
were the British members, and
C. D. Howe
was the Canadian member.
[71]
Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir
Ronald Ian Campbell
, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States,
Lord Halifax
, in early 1945. Dill died in November 1944 and was replaced by Field Marshal
Henry Maitland Wilson
.
[72]
When cooperation resumed after the Quebec Agreement, the Americans' progress and expenditures amazed the British. Chadwick pressed for British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent and abandoned hopes of an independent British project during the war.
[66]
With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honored.
[73]
The British Mission that arrived in the United States in December 1943 included
Niels Bohr
, Otto Frisch,
Klaus Fuchs
, Rudolf Peierls, and
Ernest Titterton
.
[74]
More scientists arrived in early 1944. While those assigned to gaseous diffusion left by the fall of 1944, the thirty-five working under Oliphant with Lawrence at Berkeley were assigned to existing laboratory groups and most stayed until the end of the war. The nineteen sent to Los Alamos also joined existing groups, primarily related to implosion and bomb assembly, but not the plutonium-related ones.
[66]
The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without the mutual consent of the US and UK. In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the nuclear bombing of Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.
[75]
The Combined Policy Committee created the
Combined Development Trust
in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure uranium and
thorium ores
on international markets. The
Belgian Congo
and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the
Belgian Government in Exile
was in London. Britain agreed to give the United States most of the Belgian ore, as it could not use most of the supply without restricted American research.
[76]
In 1944, the Trust purchased 3,440,000 pounds (1,560,000 kg) of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the Belgian Congo. To avoid briefing US Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Morgenthau Jr.
, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and his resignation from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5 million.
[77]
Groves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them. The British wartime participation was crucial to the success of the United Kingdom's
independent nuclear weapons program
after the war when the
McMahon Act
of 1946 temporarily ended American nuclear cooperation.

The day after he took over the project, Groves went to Tennessee with Colonel Marshall to inspect the proposed site there, and Groves was impressed.
[79]
[80]
On 29 September 1942,
United States Under Secretary of War
Robert P. Patterson
authorized the Corps of Engineers to acquire 56,000 acres (23,000 ha) of land by
eminent domain
at a cost of $3.5 million. An additional 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) was subsequently acquired. About 1,000 families were affected by the order, which came into effect on 7 October.
[81]
Protests, legal appeals, and a 1943 Congressional inquiry were to no avail.
[82]
By mid-November
U.S. Marshals
were posting notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.
[83]
Some families were given two weeks' notice to vacate farms that had been their homes for generations.
[84]
The ultimate cost of the land acquisition, which was not completed until March 1945, was only about $2.6 million—around $47 an acre.
[85]
When presented with a proclamation declaring Oak Ridge a total exclusion area that no one could enter without military permission, the
Governor of Tennessee
,
Prentice Cooper
, angrily tore it up.
[86]
Initially known as the Kingston Demolition Range, the site was officially renamed the
Clinton Engineer Works
(CEW) in early 1943.
[87]
While Stone & Webster concentrated on the production facilities, the architectural and engineering firm
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill
developed a residential community for 13,000. The community was located on the slopes of Black Oak Ridge, from which the new town of
Oak Ridge
got its name.
[88]
The Army presence at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall as head of the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although the name of the district did not change.
[89]
In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to
Turner Construction Company
through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company.
[90]
Chemical engineers were part of "frantic efforts" to make 10% to 12% enriched uranium 235, with tight security and fast approvals for supplies and materials.
[91]
The population of Oak Ridge soon expanded well beyond the initial plans, and peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works,
[78]
and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.
[90]
Los Alamos
Main article:
Project Y
Map of Los Alamos site, New Mexico, 1943-1945
The idea of locating Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, but it was decided that it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of
Albuquerque, New Mexico
, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch.
[92]
On 16 November 1942, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the vicinity of the
Los Alamos Ranch School
. Oppenheimer expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty, which, it was hoped, would inspire those working on the project.
[93]
[94]
The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.
[95]
Patterson approved the acquisition of the site on 25 November 1942, authorizing $440,000 for the purchase of 54,000 acres (22,000 ha), all but 8,900 acres (3,600 ha) of which were already owned by the Federal Government.

granted 45,100 acres (18,300 ha) of
United States Forest Service
land to the
War Department
"for so long as the military necessity continues".
[97]
Wartime land purchases eventually came to 45,737 acres (18,509.1 ha), but only $414,971 was spent.
[96]
Work commenced in December 1942. Groves initially allocated $300,000 for construction, three times Oppenheimer's estimate, but by the time Sundt finished on 30 November 1943, over $7 million had been spent.
[98]
Because it was secret, Los Alamos was referred to as "Site Y" or "the Hill".
[99]
Initially Los Alamos was to have been a military laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army, but
Robert Bacher
and
Isidor Rabi
, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department.

Leona Woods
and
Leó Szilárd
in the second.
An Army-OSRD council on 25 June 1942 decided to build a
pilot plant
for plutonium production in the
Argonne Forest preserve
, southwest of Chicago. In July, Nichols arranged for a lease of 1,025 acres (415 ha) from the
Cook County Forest Preserve District
, and Captain James F. Grafton was appointed Chicago area engineer. It soon became apparent that the scale of operations was too great for the area, and it was decided to build the pilot plant at Oak Ridge and keep a research and testing facility in Chicago.
[102]
[103]
Delays in establishing the plant at Argonne led Compton to authorize the Metallurgical Laboratory to construct the first nuclear reactor beneath the
bleachers
of
Stagg Field
at the University of Chicago. The reactor required an enormous amount of
graphite
blocks and uranium pellets. At the time, there was a limited source of pure
uranium
.
Frank Spedding
of
Iowa State University
was able to produce only two
short tons
of pure uranium. Three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by
Westinghouse Lamp Plant
, produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by
Goodyear Tire
to encase the reactor.
[104]
[105]
On 2 December 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi initiated the first artificial
[note 4]
self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as
Chicago Pile-1
.
[107]
The point at which a reaction becomes self-sustaining became known as "going critical". Compton reported the success to Conant in Washington, D.C., by a coded phone call, saying, "The Italian navigator [Fermi] has just landed in the new world."
[108]
[note 5]
In January 1943, Grafton's successor, Major
Arthur V. Peterson
, ordered Chicago Pile-1 dismantled and reassembled at the Argonne Forest site, as he regarded the operation of a reactor as too hazardous for a densely populated area.
[109]
The new site, still operated by the Metallurgical Laboratory, became known as '
Site A
'.
Chicago Pile-3
, the first heavy water reactor, also went critical at this site, on 15 May 1944.
[110]
[111]
After the war, operations at Site A were moved about 6 miles (9.7 km) to
DuPage County
, the current location of the
Argonne National Laboratory
.
[103]
Hanford
Main article:
Hanford Engineer Works
By December 1942 there were concerns that even Oak Ridge was too close to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited
DuPont
in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. The President of the company,
Walter S. Carpenter, Jr.
, wanted no profit of any kind; for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon.
[112]
Hanford workers collect their paychecks at the Western Union office.
DuPont recommended that the site be located far from the existing uranium production facility at Oak Ridge.
[113]
In December 1942, Groves dispatched Colonel
Franklin Matthias
and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that
Hanford Site
near
Richland, Washington
, was "ideal in virtually all respects". It was isolated and near the
Columbia River
, which could supply sufficient water to cool the reactors. Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works (HEW), codenamed "Site W".
[114]
Under Secretary Patterson gave his approval on 9 February, allocating $5 million for the acquisition of 430,000 acres (170,000 ha). The federal government relocated some 1,500 residents of nearby settlements, as well as the
Wanapum
and other tribes using the area. A dispute arose with farmers over compensation for crops, which had already been planted. Where schedules allowed, the Army allowed the crops to be harvested, but this was not always possible.
[114]
The land acquisition process dragged on and was not completed before the end of the Manhattan Project in December 1946.
[115]
The dispute did not delay work. Although progress on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict the scope of the project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site.
[116]
At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state.
[117]
Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago.
[118]
Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences and guard dogs were less evident.
[119]
Canadian sites
Main article:
Montreal Laboratory
British Columbia
Cominco
had produced electrolytic hydrogen at
Trail, British Columbia
, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 that it could produce heavy water. To the existing $10 million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75 MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process,
Hugh Taylor
of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon
catalyst
for the first three stages while Urey developed a nickel-
chromia
one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8 million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for
Chicago Pile 3
, the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.
[120]
Ontario
The
Chalk River, Ontario
, site was established to rehouse the Allied effort at the
Montreal Laboratory
away from an urban area. A new community was built at
Deep River, Ontario
, to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base,
Camp Petawawa
. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first director of the new laboratory was
Hans von Halban
. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who was succeeded by
Bennett Lewis
in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as
ZEEP
(zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945; ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970.
[121]
A larger 10 MW
NRX
reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.
[120]

The

[122]
Heavy water sites
Main article:
P-9 Project
Although DuPont's preferred designs for the nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator, DuPont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup. The
P-9 Project
was the government's codename for the heavy water production program. It was estimated that 3 short tons (2.7 t) of heavy water would be required per month. The plant at Trail, then under construction, could produce 0.5 short tons (0.45 t) per month. Groves therefore authorized DuPont to establish heavy water facilities at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near
Morgantown, West Virginia
; at the
Wabash River Ordnance Works
, near
Dana
and
Newport, Indiana
; and at the
Alabama Ordnance Works
, near
Childersburg
and
Sylacauga, Alabama
. Although known as Ordnance Works and paid for under
Ordnance Department
contracts, they were built and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The American plants used a process different from Trail's; heavy water was extracted by distillation, taking advantage of the slightly higher boiling point of heavy water.
[123]
[124]
Uranium
Ore
The majority of the uranium used in the Manhattan Project came from the
Shinkolobwe
mine in
Belgian Congo
.
The key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in
Joachimsthal
in Czechoslovakia, and in the
Belgian Congo
.
[125]
All but Joachimstal were in Allied hands. A 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.
[126]
Nichols arranged with the
State Department
for export controls to be placed on
uranium oxide
and negotiated for the purchase of 1,200 short tons (1,100 t) of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on
Staten Island
and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo. He negotiated with
Eldorado Gold Mines
for the purchase of ore from its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.
[127]
While these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to control as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The richest source of ore was the
Shinkolobwe
mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with
Edgar Sengier
, the director of the company that owned the mine, the
Union Minière du Haut-Katanga
.
[128]
The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee. As 30 percent of Union Minière's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador
John Winant
hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and 1,720 short tons (1,560 t) of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.
[129]
To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in
Uravan, Colorado
.
Uranium mining in Colorado
yielded about 800 short tons (730 t) of ore.
[130]
The raw ore was dissolved in
nitric acid
to produce
uranyl nitrate
, which was processed into
uranium trioxide
, which was reduced to highly pure
uranium dioxide
.
[131]
By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult.
[132]
Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at
Iowa State College
in
Ames, Iowa
, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This became known as the
Ames Project
, and its
Ames process
became available in 1943.

Isotope separation
Natural uranium consists of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, but as only the latter is
fissile
it must be physically separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for
uranium enrichment
, most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.
[134]
The most obvious technology, the centrifuge, failed, but electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful and contributed to the project. In February 1943, Groves came up with the idea of using the output of some plants as the input for others.
[135]
Oak Ridge hosted several uranium separation technologies. The Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant is in the upper right. The K-25 and K-27 gaseous diffusion plants are in the lower left, near the S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The X-10 was for plutonium production.
Centrifuges
The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942.
[136]
Jesse Beams
had developed such a process in the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. In 1941 he began working with
uranium hexafluoride
, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia,
Karl P. Cohen
produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.
[137]
Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with 1-meter (3 ft 3 in) rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with 4-meter (13 ft) rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting,
[138]
and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase efficiency. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.
[139]
In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee.
[140]
Research into the centrifuge method advanced significantly after the war with the introduction of the
Zippe-type centrifuge
, which was developed in the Soviet Union by Soviet and captured German engineers.
[141]
It eventually became the preferred method of uranium isotope separation, being far more economical.
[142]
Electromagnetic separation
Main article:
Y-12 Project
Electromagnetic isotope separation was developed at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as
calutrons
. The name was derived from the words
California
,
university
and
cyclotron
.
[143]
In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.
[144]
The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.
[145]
Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.
[143]
Alpha I racetrack at Y-12
Marshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require 5,000 short tons (4,500 tonnes) of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 copper to silver ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with
Under Secretary of the Treasury
Daniel W. Bell
and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the
West Point Bullion Depository
.
[146]
Ultimately 14,700 short tons (13,300 tonnes; 430,000,000 troy ounces) were used.
[147]
The 1,000-troy-ounce (31 kg) silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets, extruded into strips, and wound onto magnetic coils.
[147]
[148]
The
Calutron Girls
were young women who monitored calutron control panels at Y-12. Gladys Owens, seated in the foreground, was unaware of what she had been involved in.
[149]
Responsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called
Y-12
, was assigned to Stone & Webster in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.
[150]
The second Alpha I was operational at the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.
[151]
Tennessee Eastman
was contracted to manage Y-12.
[152]
The calutrons were turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators known as the
Calutron Girls
.
[153]
The calutrons initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant, and the next month they received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August, K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.
[154]
Gaseous diffusion
Main article:
K-25
The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion.
Graham's law
states that the rate of
effusion
of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its
molecular mass
, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey,
Karl P. Cohen
, and
John R. Dunning
.
[155]
Oak Ridge K-25 plant
In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant.
[156]
On 14 December,
M. W. Kellogg
accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project.
[157]
The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps had to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which had to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the
Bell Telephone Laboratories
and the
Bakelite
Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.
[158]
[159]
Kellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story 0.5-mile (0.80 km) long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections containing cells of six stages. A survey party began construction by marking out the 500-acre (2.0 km
2
) site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor,
Union Carbide
and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480 million.
[160]
The production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment, and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.
[161]
Thermal diffusion
Main article:
S-50 Project
The thermal diffusion process was based on
Sydney Chapman
and
David Enskog
's
theory
, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end.
[162]
It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.
[163]
The Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when
Captain
William S. Parsons
, the naval officer in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer informed Groves, who approved construction of a thermal plant on 24 June 1944.
[164]
The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smokestacks).
Groves contracted with the H. K. Ferguson Company of
Cleveland
, Ohio, to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50.
[165]
Plans called for the installation of 2,142 48-foot-tall (15 m) diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (690 kPa) and temperature of 545 °F (285 °C), flowed downward through the innermost 1.25-inch (32 mm) nickel pipe, while water at 155 °F (68 °C) flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. The uranium hexafluoride flowed in the middle copper pipe, and isotope separation of the uranium occurred between the nickel and copper pipes.
[166]
Work commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 the S-50 plant produced 12,730 pounds (5,770 kg) of slightly enriched product.
[167]
By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching the uranium from 0.71% to 0.89% uranium-235. This was then fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. In turn, this was fed into Y-12,
[168]
which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for use in nuclear weapons. About 50 kilograms (110 lb) of uranium enriched to 89% was delivered to Los Alamos by July 1945. The entire 50 kg, along with some 50%-enriched, averaging out to about 85% enriched, were used in the first
Little Boy
bomb.
[169]
Plutonium
The second line of development pursued by the Manhattan Project used plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities is via a reactor. Natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons and
transmuted
into
uranium-239
, which rapidly decays, first into
neptunium-239
and then into
plutonium-239
.
[170]
As only a small amount will be transformed, the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from
fission products
.
[170]
X-10 Graphite Reactor
Main article:
X-10 Graphite Reactor
Workers load uranium slugs into the X-10 Graphite Reactor.
In March 1943, DuPont began construction of a plutonium plant on a 112-acre (0.5 km
2
) site at Oak Ridge. Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled
X-10 Graphite Reactor
, a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot.
[171]
The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, 24 feet (7.3 m) per side, weighing around 1,500 short tons (1,400 t), surrounded by 7 feet (2.1 m) of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.
[171]
The greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a
hot dipping process
without success.
Alcoa
tried canning, developing a new process for flux-less welding; 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of
General Electric
, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.
[172]
The X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about 30 short tons (27 t) of uranium. A week later the load was increased to 36 short tons (33 t), raising its power generation to 500 kW, and by the end of the month the first 500 mg of plutonium was created.
[173]
Gradual modifications raised the power to 4,000 kW in July 1944. X-10 operated as a production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research.
[174]
Hanford reactors
Main article:
Hanford Engineer Works
Although an air-cooled design was chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, this would be impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build.
[175]
The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.
[176]
Aerial view of Hanford
B-Reactor
site, June 1944
As at Oak Ridge, the most difficulty was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were
pickled
to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and
aluminum-silicon alloy
, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using
arc welding
under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were tested to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start
Reactor B
on schedule in August 1944.
[177]
Work began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250 MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.
[178]
The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites developed first, as this maximized the distance between the reactors. They would be the only ones constructed during the Manhattan Project.
[179]
Some 390 short tons (350 t) of steel, 17,400 cubic yards (13,300 m
3
) of concrete, 50,000 concrete blocks and 71,000 concrete bricks were used to construct the 120-foot (37 m) high building.
Construction of the reactor itself commenced in February 1944.
[180]
Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's
Crawford Greenewalt
,
Leona Woods
and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the
control rods
to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.
[181]
[182]
Fermi contacted
Chien-Shiung Wu
, who identified the cause of the problem as
neutron poisoning
from
xenon-135
, which has a
half-life
of 9.2 hours.
[183]
Fermi, Woods,
Donald J. Hughes
and
John Archibald Wheeler
then calculated the
nuclear cross section
of xenon-135, which turned out to be 30,000 times that of uranium.
[184]
DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.
[185]
Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.

Separation process

Meanwhile, the chemists considered the problem of how plutonium could be separated from uranium when its chemical properties were not known. Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a
lanthanum fluoride process
which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the
bismuth phosphate process
, was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson.
[187]
Greenewalt favored the bismuth phosphate process due to the corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants.
[188]
Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%.
[174]
At Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.
[189]
Early plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East.
[190]
Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or "canyon" (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231) and a magazine store (213). The canyons were each 800 feet (240 m) long and 65 feet (20 m) wide. Each consisted of forty 17.7-by-13-by-20-foot (5.4 by 4.0 by 6.1 m) cells.
[191]
Work began on 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, with the former completed in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected by the end of the year.

On 5 February 1945, Matthias hand-delivered the first shipment of 80 g of 95%-pure plutonium nitrate to a Los Alamos courier in Los Angeles.

Weapon design

In 1943, development efforts were directed to a
gun-type fission weapon
with plutonium called
Thin Man
. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure but could only be created in very small amounts.
[193]
Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.
[194]
This rendered it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon, for the plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too soon, causing a
predetonation
that would disperse the critical mass after a minimal amount of plutonium had fissioned (a
fizzle
). A higher-velocity gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was also considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.
[195]
Work on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier under the direction of the physicist
Seth Neddermeyer
. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. The critical mass is assembled in much less time than with the gun method. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases,
[196]
so it also makes more efficient use of the fissionable material.
[197]
Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations showed promise, but also made it clear that an implosion weapon was more complex than the gun-type design from both a theoretical and an engineering perspective.
[198]
In September 1943,
John von Neumann
, who had experience with
shaped charges
, proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.
[199]
An implosion-type nuclear bomb
An accelerated effort on the implosion design, codenamed
Fat Man
, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.
[200]
Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert
George Kistiakowsky
and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher.
[201]
[202]
The new design featured
explosive lenses
that focused the implosion into a spherical shape.
[203]
The design of lenses turned out to be slow, difficult and frustrating.
[203]
Various explosives were tested before settling on
composition B
and
baratol
.
[204]
The final design resembled a soccer ball, with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about 80 pounds (36 kg). Getting the detonation just right required fast, reliable and safe electrical
detonators
