Dalgona Coffee
[
edit
]
Dalgona
is a traditional Korean hard candy made with sugar and baking soda. But for
Dalgona Coffee
,
instead of putting hard formation candy into the coffee, make a whip foam cream with Americano and sugar. Then put the Dalgona cream on top of the milk of your choice.
[30]
Dalgona coffee was newly invented during the COVID-19 pandemic by people. The reason Dalgona coffee got viral during that period was due to the pandemic, people were in a situation where they had to stay home for safety.
[31]
The regulation of the pandemic was when the covid test results came out to be positive people had to quarantine for 14 days. With this background situation, people kept searching for things that they could stay active and productive during the time they stay home. The process of making Dalgona coffee was perfect for people. To make Dalgona whip cream, at least 400 times or more stirring process is needed. It’s hard to make but it was a creative and innovative taste of coffee at that time because people could make 'coffee shop' coffee at home.
[31]
People started to post themselves making Dalgona coffee and this became some sort of trend 'Dalgona coffee challenge' and it spreaded through social media such as Google, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.
[31]
It went viral not only in Korea but also it went widespread all over the world included not only the Asia but also Central and South America.
[31]
Even after the pandemic ended, lots of coffee shops in Korea launched Dalgona coffee as one of the new menu items. One of the popular coffee chain, Ediya coffee launched 'Dalgona latte' in May 2020.

A buffalo wallowing
Wallowing
in animals is
comfort behaviour
during which an animal rolls about or lies in
mud
,
water
or
snow
.
[1]
Some definitions include rolling about in dust,
[2]
however, in
ethology
this is usually referred to as
dust bathing
.  Wallowing is often combined with other behaviours to fulfil its purpose; for example, elephants will often blow dirt over themselves after wallowing to create a thicker "coating", or pigs will allow the mud to dry before rubbing themselves on a tree or rock to remove
ectoparasites
stuck in the mud.

Domestic pigs

Domestic pigs wallowing
Pigs lack functional sweat glands and are almost incapable of panting. To thermoregulate, they rely on wallowing in water or mud to cool the body. Adult pigs under natural or free-range conditions can often be seen to wallow when air temperature exceeds 20 °C. Mud is the preferred substrate; after wallowing, the wet mud provides a cooling, and probably protecting, layer on the body. When pigs enter a wallow, they normally dig and root in the mud before entering with the fore-body first. They then wriggle the body back and forth, and rub their faces in the mud so all of the body surface is covered. Before they leave the wallow, they often shake their heads and body, often finishing with rubbing against a tree or a stone next to the wallow. When indoors and hot, domestic pigs often attempt to wallow on wet floor surfaces and in the dunging areas.
[25]
Although temperature regulation seems to be the main motivation for wallowing in pigs, they will still wallow in colder weather. While many have suggested that pigs wallow in mud because of a lack of sweat glands, pigs and other wallowing animals may have not evolved functional sweat glands because wallowing was a part of their behavioural repertoire.
[7]
Pigs are genetically related to animals such as
hippopotamus
and
whales
. It has been argued that wallowing behaviour and the desire to be in shallow, murky water could have been a step to the evolution of whales and other marine mammals from land-dwelling mammals.

Sumatran rhinoceros wallowing
The Sumatran rhino (
Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis
) spends a large part of its day wallowing. When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. One 20-month study of wallowing behaviour found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before foraging for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80-300 minutes per day spent in wallows.  Captive individuals deprived of adequate wallowing have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins,
suppurations
, eye problems, inflamed nails, hair loss and have eventually died.

Self-anointing in animals § Ungulates
A deer wallow
Many deer perform wallowing, creating wallow sites in wet depressions in the ground, eventually forming quite large sites (2-3 m across and up to 1 m deep).  However, it has been claimed that only some species of deer wallow;
red deer
(
Cervus elaphus
) particularly like to wallow but
fallow deer
(
Dama dama
), for example, do not wallow. Even within the red deer species, there is variation between sub-species and breeds in wallowing behaviour. For example, although wapiti do wallow, they and crossbreds are less inclined to wallow than European red deer.

Jeffrey Wayne Karstens
(born September 24, 1982) is a former
right-handed
starting pitcher
in
Major League Baseball
(MLB). Karstens pitched for the
New York Yankees
in 2006 and 2007 and the
Pittsburgh Pirates
from 2008 to 2012.
High school and college
[
edit
]
Karstens attended
Mount Miguel High School
in
Spring Valley, California
. In his senior season, he was the team's
Most Valuable Player
, a First-Team All-Conference Honors selection, and a Second-Team All-San Diego selection. In his senior year, he posted an 8-2 record with a 2.99
ERA
. After high school, Karstens attended
Grossmont College
[1]
and
Texas Tech University
in
Lubbock, Texas
, where he played for the
Red Raiders
.
Professional career
[
edit
]
New York Yankees
[
edit
]
Karstens was drafted in the 19th round of the
2003 Major League Baseball draft
by the
New York Yankees
. He played the
2005
season with the Yankees' Double-A affiliate, the
Trenton Thunder
, posting a 12-11 record with a 4.15 ERA and 147
strikeouts
. He led his team in
wins
with 12 (3rd most in the
league
), in Games started with 27 (2nd in the league), and in
innings pitched
with 169 (4th in the league).
[2]
Karstens started the
2006
season with the Yankees Triple-A affiliate, the
Columbus Clippers
. He struggled, posting an 0-5 record with a 9.85 ERA. This resulted in his demotion to Double-A Trenton.  At Trenton, he went 6-0 with a 2.31 ERA. His success was rewarded with a trip back to Columbus, where he compiled a 5-0 record with a 1.85 ERA. Karstens was called up from Triple-A Columbus on August 19, 2006. Three days later, he made his Major League debut for the Yankees on August 22, against the
Seattle Mariners
. He went 5⅔ innings, allowing three
earned runs
on six
hits
and two
walks
for a no-decision in a 6-5 loss. He
struck out
two and gave up two
home runs
.
[3]
On August 27, 2006, he went 6.0 innings giving up 6 hits and 3 earned runs in an 11-8 win against the
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim
. In that outing, Karstens walked 2, struck out 1, and earned his first career Major League victory.
[4]
In
spring training
prior to the
2007
season, Karstens had an outstanding performance. The first nine innings he pitched were the equivalent of a nine inning shutout. Following that he had a poor four run outing yet he was still considered a darkhorse to make the rotation. The most probable situation would be that he start the season as the long reliever with an occasional spot start. Karstens was shut down due to elbow tendinitis and placed on the 15-day
disabled list
to start the season, allowing
Darrell Rasner
to take his spot in the rotation, which he earned after a hamstring injury to staff ace
Chien-Ming Wang
. After injuries to Yankees starters
Mike Mussina
and
Carl Pavano
, he was activated to join the Yankee 40-man roster.
[5]
On April 28,
2007
, in a game against the
Boston Red Sox
, Karstens was struck in the leg by a line drive off the bat of Boston shortstop
Julio Lugo
, the first batter of the game.
[6]
He faced only one more batter before being taken out.
[6]
It was later reported that Karstens fractured his
fibula
and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He was later moved to the 60-day disabled list, and then activated on August 1.
On August 14, 2007, Karstens gave up 5 earned runs in only 3 innings, raising his season ERA to 11.20. The next day, he was optioned back to the Minor Leagues. He was reactivated on September 9. Karstens began the
2008
season on the 15-day disabled list, but was later activated and immediately optioned to the minors.
Pittsburgh Pirates
[
edit
]
On July 26, 2008, Karstens was acquired by the Pirates with
José Tábata
,
Ross Ohlendorf
, and
Daniel McCutchen
from the
New York Yankees
for outfielder
Xavier Nady
and pitcher
Dámaso Marte
.
[7]
On August 1, 2008, Jeff made his Pirates debut, defeating the
Chicago Cubs
. In Karsten's next start on August 6, he took a perfect game against the
Arizona Diamondbacks
through 7.2 innings before surrendering a double to
Chris Young
in the 8th inning. Karstens, and the Pirates, won 2-0 over
Randy Johnson
; Karstens gave up two hits and a walk.
In 2009, Karstens was fined an undisclosed amount by Major League Baseball for hitting Milwaukee's
Ryan Braun
squarely between his shoulder blades with a pitch in April.
[1]
[2]
The Brewers took exception to this and later in the season Karstens was hit by a pitch in the left shoulder by a Milwaukee pitcher. He finished his 2009 campaign of 39 games (13 of which he started) with a 4-6 record, a 5.42 ERA, gave up 12 home runs, hit 2 batsmen, walked 45, struck out 52, had a .279 average against, 1.48 walks and hits per inning pitched, in just 108 innings pitched. Karstens was
designated for assignment
following the 2009 season. On November 30, 2009, Karstens cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Triple-A
Indianapolis Indians
.
In 2010, Karstens attended Pirates spring training as a non-roster invitee. He pitched relief in 8 games for a 6.23 ERA and was reassigned to the minor league camp. He began the season in the Triple-A Indianapolis bullpen, but problems with starting Pirates starting pitching prompted a call-up on April 27.
Karstens was the pitching matchup in the highly anticipated debut of young phenom
Stephen Strasburg
, giving up 9 hits for 4 runs (4
earned
) in 5 innings for his second loss of the season.
On July 18, 2011, Karstens was named as the
National League Player of the Week
for the period of July 11-17, 2011. Karstens pitched a complete-game shutout on July 15 in a 4-0 win over the
Houston Astros
and became the first Pirates starter to win five consecutive decisions since
Ian Snell
in June 2006.
[8]
Karstens had the best season of his career in 2011.  Appearing in 30 games (26 starts), in which he went 9-9 with an ERA of 3.38, giving up 22 home runs, hitting 4 batsmen, walking 33, striking out 96, and having a WHIP of 1.207 through 162.1 innings.
[9]
On November 30, 2012, Karstens was designated for assignment and then was not tendered a contract, making him a free agent.
On January 15, 2013, the Pirates resigned Karstens to a 1-year deal.
[10]
Karstens underwent surgery on his rotator cuff and labrum in his throwing shoulder on June 7, 2013 and was shut down for the rest of the 2013 season.
On May 4, 2015, Karstens announced via Twitter and Instagram his retirement from baseball.

Biology
is the
scientific
study of
life
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
It is a
natural science
with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.
[1]
[2]
[3]
For instance, all
organisms
are made up of
cells
that process hereditary information encoded in
genes
, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is
evolution
, which explains the unity and diversity of life.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Energy processing
is also important to life as it allows organisms to
move
, grow, and
reproduce
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own
internal environments
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
Biologists
are able to study life at multiple
levels of organization
,
[1]
from the
molecular biology
of a cell to the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
plants
and
animals
, and evolution of
populations
.
[1]
[6]
Hence, there are multiple
subdisciplines within biology
, each defined by the nature of their
research questions
and the
tools
that they use.
[7]
[8]
[9]
Like other
scientists
, biologists use the
scientific method
to make
observations
, pose questions, generate
hypotheses
, perform
experiments
, and form conclusions about the world around them.
[1]
Life on
Earth
, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,
[10]
is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from
prokaryotic
organisms such as
archaea
and
bacteria
to
eukaryotic
organisms such as
protists
,
fungi
,
plants
, and
animals
. These various organisms contribute to the
biodiversity
of an
ecosystem
, where they play specialized roles in the
cycling
of
nutrients
and
energy
through their
biophysical environment
.
History
Main article:
History of biology
Diagram of a fly from
Robert Hooke
's innovative
Micrographia
, 1665
The earliest of roots of
science
, which included
medicine
, can be traced to
ancient Egypt
and
Mesopotamia
in around 3000 to 1200
BCE
.
[11]
[12]
Their contributions shaped ancient Greek
natural philosophy
.
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
Ancient Greek
philosophers such as
Aristotle
(384-322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor,
Theophrastus
, began the scientific study of plants.
[15]
Scholars of the
medieval Islamic world
who wrote on biology included
al-Jahiz
(781-869),
Al-Dīnawarī
(828-896), who wrote on botany,
[16]
and
Rhazes
(865-925) who wrote on
anatomy
and
physiology
. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.
Biology began to quickly develop with
Anton van Leeuwenhoek
's dramatic improvement of the
microscope
. It was then that scholars discovered
spermatozoa
,
bacteria
,
infusoria
and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by
Jan Swammerdam
led to new interest in
entomology
and helped to develop techniques of microscopic
dissection
and
staining
.
[17]
Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the
cell
. In 1838,
Schleiden
and
Schwann
began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of
life
, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support
spontaneous generation
. However,
Robert Remak
and
Rudolf Virchow
were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into
cell theory
.
[18]
[19]
Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians.
Carl Linnaeus
published a basic
taxonomy
for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced
scientific names
for all his species.
[20]
Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon
, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of
common descent
.
[21]
In 1842,
Charles Darwin
penned his first sketch of
On the Origin of Species
.
[22]
Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
, who presented a coherent theory of evolution.
[23]
The British naturalist
Charles Darwin
, combining the biogeographical approach of
Humboldt
, the uniformitarian geology of
Lyell
,
Malthus's
writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on
natural selection
; similar reasoning and evidence led
Alfred Russel Wallace
to independently reach the same conclusions.
[24]
[25]
The basis for modern genetics began with the work of
Gregor Mendel
in 1865.
[26]
This outlined the principles of biological inheritance.
[27]
However, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the
modern synthesis
reconciled Darwinian evolution with
classical genetics
.
[28]
In the 1940s and early 1950s, a
series of experiments
by
Alfred Hershey
and
Martha Chase
pointed to
DNA
as the component of
chromosomes
that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as
genes
. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as
viruses
and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by
James Watson
and
Francis Crick
in 1953, marked the transition to the era of
molecular genetics
. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the
molecular
domain. The
genetic code
was cracked by
Har Gobind Khorana
,
Robert W. Holley
and
Marshall Warren Nirenberg
after DNA was understood to contain
codons
. The
Human Genome Project
was launched in 1990 to map the human
genome
.
[29]
Chemical basis
Atoms and molecules
Further information:
Chemistry
All organisms are made up of
chemical elements
;
[30]
oxygen
,
carbon
,
hydrogen
, and
nitrogen
account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with
calcium
,
phosphorus
,
sulfur
,
sodium
,
chlorine
, and
magnesium
constituting essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form
compounds
such as water, which is fundamental to life.
[30]
Biochemistry
is the study of
chemical processes
within and relating to living
organisms
.
Molecular biology
is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including
molecular
synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.
Water
Model of hydrogen bonds (1) between molecules of
water
See also:
Planetary habitability
,
Circumstellar habitable zone
, and
Water distribution on Earth
Life arose from the Earth's first
ocean
, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.
[31]
Since then,
water
continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective
solvent
, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and
chloride
ions or other small molecules to form an
aqueous
solution
. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in
chemical reactions
that sustain life.
[31]
In terms of its
molecular structure
, water is a small
polar molecule
with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H
2
O).
[31]
Because the O-H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.
[31]
This polar
property
of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water
cohesive
.
[31]
Surface tension
results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.
[31]
Water is also
adhesive
as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.
[31]
Water is
denser
as a
liquid
than it is as a solid (or
ice
).
[31]
This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby
insulating
the liquid below from the cold air above.
[31]
Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher
specific heat capacity
than other solvents such as
ethanol
.
[31]
Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into
water vapor
.
[31]
As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and
hydroxyl
ions before reforming into a water molecule again.
[31]
In
pure water
, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a
pH
that is neutral.
Organic compounds
Further information:
Organic chemistry
Organic compounds such as
glucose
are vital to organisms.
Organic compounds
are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen.
[31]
With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.
[31]
[32]
Carbon can form
covalent bonds
with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules.
[31]
[32]
For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in
methane
, two
double covalent bonds
such as in
carbon dioxide
(CO
2
), or a
triple covalent bond
such as in
carbon monoxide
(CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting
carbon-carbon bonds
such as
octane
or ring-like structures such as
glucose
.
The simplest form of an organic molecule is the
hydrocarbon
, which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other elements such as oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), which can change the chemical behavior of that compound.
[31]
Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called
functional groups
.
[31]
There are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms:
amino group
,
carboxyl group
,
carbonyl group
,
hydroxyl group
,
phosphate group
, and
sulfhydryl group
.
[31]
In 1953, the
Miller-Urey experiment
showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of
early Earth
, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see
abiogenesis
).

Macromolecules
Main article:
Macromolecule
The (a) primary, (b) secondary, (c) tertiary, and (d) quaternary structures of a
hemoglobin
protein
Macromolecules
are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or
monomers
.
[34]
Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.
[35]
Carbohydrates
include monomers and polymers of sugars.
[36]
Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include
steroids
,
phospholipids
, and
fats
,
[35]
largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances.
[37]
Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include
enzymes
,
transport proteins
, large
signaling
molecules,
antibodies
, and
structural proteins
. The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an
amino acid
.
[34]
Twenty amino acids are used in proteins.
[34]
Nucleic acids are polymers of
nucleotides
.
[38]
Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.

Cells
Main article:
Cell (biology)
Cell theory
states that
cells
are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through
cell division
.
[39]
Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100
micrometers
and are therefore only visible under a
light
or
electron microscope
.
[40]
There are generally two types of cells:
eukaryotic
cells, which contain a
nucleus
, and
prokaryotic
cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are
single-celled organisms
such as
bacteria
, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or
multicellular
. In
multicellular organisms
, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a
single cell
in a fertilized
egg
.
Cell structure
Structure of an animal
cell
depicting various
organelles
Every cell is enclosed within a
cell membrane
that separates its
cytoplasm
from the
extracellular space
.
[41]
A cell membrane consists of a
lipid bilayer
, including
cholesterols
that sit between phospholipids to maintain their
fluidity
at various temperatures. Cell membranes are
semipermeable
, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as
ions
.
[42]
Cell membranes also contains
membrane proteins
, including
integral membrane proteins
that go across the membrane serving as
membrane transporters
, and
peripheral proteins
that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell.
[43]
Cell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as
cell adhesion
,
storing electrical energy
, and
cell signalling
and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a
cell wall
,
glycocalyx
, and
cytoskeleton
.
Structure of a plant cell
Within the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as
proteins
and
nucleic acids
.
[44]
In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called
organelles
that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units.
[45]
These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell's DNA, or
mitochondria
, which generates
adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as
endoplasmic reticulum
and
Golgi apparatus
play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by
lysosomes
, another specialized organelle.
Plant cells
have additional organelles that distinguish them from
animal cells
such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell,
chloroplasts
that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and
vacuoles
that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds.
[45]
Eukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of
microtubules
,
intermediate filaments
, and
microfilaments
, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles.
[45]
In terms of their structural composition, the microtubules are made up of
tubulin
(e.g.,
α-tubulin
and
β-tubulin
whereas intermediate filaments are made up of fibrous proteins.
[45]
Microfilaments are made up of
actin
molecules that interact with other strands of proteins.
[45]
Metabolism
Further information:
Bioenergetics
Example of an enzyme-catalysed
exothermic
reaction
All cells require
energy
to sustain cellular processes.
Metabolism
is the set of
chemical reactions
in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of
metabolic wastes
. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as
catabolic
—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by
cellular respiration
); or
anabolic
—the building up (
synthesis
) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into
metabolic pathways
, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by
coupling
them to
spontaneous reactions
that release energy. Enzymes act as
catalysts
—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it—by reducing the amount of
activation energy
needed to convert
reactants
into
products
. Enzymes also allow the
regulation
of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.
Cellular respiration
Main article:
Cellular respiration
Respiration in a
eukaryotic cell
Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert
chemical energy
from
nutrients
into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.
[46]
The reactions involved in respiration are
catabolic reactions
, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are
redox
reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a
combustion reaction
, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.
Sugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages:
glycolysis
,
citric acid cycle
(or Krebs cycle),
electron transport chain
, and
oxidative phosphorylation
.
[47]
Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two
pyruvates
, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.
[47]
Each pyruvate is then oxidized into
acetyl-CoA
by the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
, which also generates
NADH
and carbon dioxide. Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH
2
, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the
mitochondrial cristae
. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four
protein complexes
that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH
2
that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (
chemiosmosis
), which generates a
proton motive force
.
[47]
Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme
ATP synthase
to synthesize more ATPs by
phosphorylating
ADPs
. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final
electron acceptor
.
If oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of
fermentation
. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to
waste products
that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD
+
so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD
+
for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is
lactic acid
. This type of fermentation is called
lactic acid fermentation
. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD
+
regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD
+
attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or
ethanol fermentation
. The ATP generated in this process is made by
substrate-level phosphorylation
, which does not require oxygen.
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O
2
, and fixes CO
2
into sugar.
Main article:
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to
convert
light energy
into
chemical energy
that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as
sugars
, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.
[48]
[49]
[50]
In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product. Most
plants
,
algae
, and
cyanobacteria
perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the
oxygen content
of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.
[51]
Photosynthesis has four stages:
Light absorption
, electron transport, ATP synthesis, and
carbon fixation
.
[47]
Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by
chlorophyll
pigments attached to proteins in the
thylakoid membranes
. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a
quinone
designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP
+
, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called
photosystem I
(PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration.
[47]
During the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their
concentration gradients
from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.
[47]
The NADPH and ATPs generated by the
light-dependent reactions
in the second and third stages, respectively, provide the energy and electrons to drive the synthesis of glucose by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide into existing organic carbon compounds, such as
ribulose bisphosphate
(RuBP) in a sequence of light-independent (or dark) reactions called the
Calvin cycle
.
[52]
Cell signaling
Main article:
Cell signaling
Cell signaling (or communication) is the ability of
cells
to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself.
[53]
[54]
Signals can be non-chemical such as light,
electrical impulses
, and heat, or chemical signals (or
ligands
) that interact with
receptors
, which can be found
embedded
in the
cell membrane
of another cell or
located deep inside
a cell.
[55]
[54]
There are generally four types of chemical signals:
autocrine
,
paracrine
,
juxtacrine
, and
hormones
.
[55]
In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it.
Tumor
cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called
neurons
release ligands called
neurotransmitters
that diffuse across a
synaptic cleft
to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or
muscle cell
. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the
circulatory systems
of animals or
vascular systems
of plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an
inotropic receptor
can alter the
excitability
of a target cell. Other types of receptors include
protein kinase
receptors (e.g.,
receptor
for the hormone
insulin
) and
G protein-coupled receptors
. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate
second messenger
cascades. The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a
series of molecular events
is called
signal transduction
Cell cycle
In meiosis, the chromosomes duplicate and the
homologous chromosomes
exchange genetic information during meiosis I. The daughter cells divide again in meiosis II to form haploid
gametes
.
Main article:
Cell cycle
The cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a
cell
that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the
duplication of its DNA
and some of its
organelles
, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called
cell division
.
[56]
In
eukaryotes
(i.e.,
animal
,
plant
,
fungal
, and
protist
cells), there are two distinct types of cell division:
mitosis
and
meiosis
.
[57]
Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated
chromosomes
are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of
interphase
(during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by
telophase
and
cytokinesis
; which divides the
cytoplasm
,
organelles
and
cell membrane
of one cell into two new
cells
containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells.
[58]
The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled
fertilized egg
develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which
hair
,
skin
,
blood cells
, and some
internal organs
are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the
interphase
of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions.
[59]
Homologous chromosomes
are separated in the first division (
meiosis I
), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (
meiosis II
). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.
Prokaryotes
(i.e.,
archaea
and
bacteria
) can also undergo cell division (or
binary fission
). Unlike the processes of
mitosis
and
meiosis
in eukaryotes, binary fission takes in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a
spindle apparatus
on the cell. Before binary fission, DNA in the bacterium is tightly coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. Growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by
FtsZ
polymerization and "Z-ring" formation)
[60]
The new cell wall (
septum
) fully develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods,
ribosomes
, and
plasmids
.
Genetics
Inheritance
Main article:
Classical genetics
Punnett square
depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms
Genetics
is the scientific study of inheritance.
[61]
[62]
[63]
Mendelian inheritance
, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring.
[27]
It has several principles. The first is that genetic characteristics,
alleles
, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the
law of dominance and uniformity
, which states that some alleles are
dominant
while others are
recessive
; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the
phenotype
of that dominant allele. During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.
Heterozygotic
individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the
law of independent assortment
, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are
sex-linked
.
Test crosses
can be performed to experimentally determine the underlying
genotype
of an organism with a dominant phenotype.
[64]
A
Punnett square
can be used to predict the results of a test cross. The
chromosome theory of inheritance
, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by
Thomas Morgans
's experiments with
fruit flies
, which established the
sex linkage
between eye color and
sex
in these insects.
[65]
Genes and DNA
Bases lie between two spiraling DNA strands.
Further information:
Gene
and
DNA
A gene is a unit of
heredity
that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism. DNA is composed of two
polynucleotide
chains that coil around each other to form a
double helix
.
[66]
It is found as linear
chromosomes
in
eukaryotes
, and circular chromosomes in
prokaryotes
. The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its
genome
. In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the
cell nucleus
.
[67]
In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the
nucleoid
.
[68]
The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its
genotype
.
[69]
DNA replication
is a
semiconservative
process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA.
[66]
Mutations are heritable changes in DNA.
[66]
They can arise
spontaneously
as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be
induced
by an environmental
mutagen
such as a chemical (e.g.,
nitrous acid
,
benzopyrene
) or radiation (e.g.,
x-ray
,
gamma ray
,
ultraviolet radiation
, particles emitted by unstable isotopes).
[66]
Mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function,
gain-of-function
, and conditional mutations.
[66]
Some mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of
genetic variation
for evolution.
[66]
Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival.
[66]
Mutagens such as
carcinogens
are typically avoided as a matter of
public health policy
goals.
[66]
Gene expression
The extended
central dogma of molecular biology
includes all the processes involved in the flow of genetic information.
Main article:
Gene expression
Gene expression is the molecular process by which a
genotype
encoded in DNA gives rise to an observable
phenotype
in the proteins of an organism's body. This process is summarized by the
central dogma of molecular biology
, which was formulated by
Francis Crick
in 1958.
[70]
[71]
[72]
According to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes:
transcription
(DNA to RNA) and
translation
(RNA to protein).
[73]
Gene regulation
Main article:
Regulation of gene expression
The regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of
development
can occur at each step of the process such as
transcription
,
RNA splicing
,
translation
, and
post-translational modification
of a protein.
[74]
Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called
transcription factors
bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter.
[74]
A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an
operon
, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g.,
Caenorhabditis elegans
).
[74]
[75]
In positive regulation of gene expression, the
activator
is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a
repressor
binds to a DNA sequence called an
operator
, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called
inducers
(e.g.,
allolactose
), thereby allowing transcription to occur.
[74]
Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called
inducible genes
, in contrast to
constitutive genes
that are almost constantly active.
[74]
In contrast to both,
structural genes
encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation.
[74]
In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by
epigenetic
changes to
chromatin
, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.
[74]
Genes, development, and evolution
Main article:
Evolutionary developmental biology
Development
is the process by which a
multicellular organism
(
plant
or
animal
) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle.
[76]
There are four key processes that underlie development:
Determination
,
differentiation
,
morphogenesis
, and growth. Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development. Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells from less specialized cells such as
stem cells
.
[77]
[78]
Stem cells are
undifferentiated
or partially differentiated
cells
that can differentiate into various
types of cells
and
proliferate
indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell.
[79]
Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape,
membrane potential
,
metabolic activity
, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in
gene expression
and
epigenetics
. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the
DNA
sequence itself.
[80]
Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same
genome
. Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression.
[76]
A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the
developmental-genetic toolkit
control the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among
phyla
, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the
Hox
genes
. Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many
vertebrae
of
snakes
, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.
[81]
Evolution
Evolutionary processes
Main article:
Evolutionary biology
Natural selection
for darker traits
Evolution
is a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in
heritable
characteristics
of
populations
over successive
generations
.
[82]
[83]
In
artificial selection
, animals were selectively bred for specific traits.
[84]
Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits.
[84]
Darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals.
[84]
He further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment.
[85]

[88]
Speciation
Main article:
Speciation
A species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other.
[89]
For speciation to occur, there has to be
reproductive isolation
.
[89]
Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by
Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model
. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with
genetic divergence
. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as
allopatric speciation
.
[89]
Phylogeny
Main article:
Phylogenetics
Phylogenetic tree showing the domains of
bacteria
,
archaea
, and
eukaryotes
A phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes.
[90]
It can be represented using a
phylogenetic tree
, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a
lineage
of descendants of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree.
[90]
Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species.
[90]
Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having
homologous
features (or
synapomorphy
).
[91]
[92]
[90]
Phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification.
[90]
This classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the
domain
followed by
kingdom
,
phylum
,
class
,
order
,
family
,
genus
, and
species
.
[90]
All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of
three domains
:
Archaea
(originally Archaebacteria);
bacteria
(originally eubacteria), or
eukarya
(includes the
protist
,
fungi
,
plant
, and
animal
kingdoms).
[93]
History of life
Main article:
History of life
The history of life on
Earth
traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on
Earth
, both living and extinct, descended from a
last universal common ancestor
that lived about
3.5 billion years ago
.
[94]
[95]
Geologists
have developed a
geologic time scale
that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (
Hadean
,
Archean
,
Proterozoic
, and
Phanerozoic
), the first three of which are collectively known as the
Precambrian
, which lasted approximately 4 billion years.
[96]
Each eon can be divided into
eras
, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago
[97]
being subdivided into
Paleozoic
,
Mesozoic
, and
Cenozoic
eras.
[96]
These three eras together comprise eleven
periods
(
Cambrian
,
Ordovician
,
Silurian
,
Devonian
,
Carboniferous
,
Permian
,
Triassic
,
Jurassic
,
Cretaceous
,
Tertiary
, and
Quaternary
).
[96]
The similarities among all known present-day
species
indicate that they have diverged through the process of
evolution
from their common ancestor.
[98]
Biologists regard the ubiquity of the
genetic code
as evidence of universal
common descent
for all
bacteria
,
archaea
, and
eukaryotes
.
[99]
[10]
[100]
[101]
Microbial mats
of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early
Archean
epoch and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment.
[102]
The earliest evidence of
eukaryotes
dates from 1.85 billion years ago,
[103]
[104]
and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their
metabolism
. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago,
multicellular organisms
began to appear, with
differentiated cells
performing specialised functions.
[105]
Algae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago,
[106]
although evidence suggests that
microorganisms
formed the earliest
terrestrial ecosystems
, at least 2.7 billion years ago.
[107]
Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the
Ordovician
period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the
Late Devonian extinction event
.
[108]
Ediacara biota
appear during the
Ediacaran
period,
[109]
while
vertebrates
, along with most other modern
phyla
originated about 525 million years ago during the
Cambrian explosion
.
[110]
During the Permian period,
synapsids
, including the ancestors of
mammals
, dominated the land,
[111]
but most of this group became extinct in the
Permian-Triassic extinction event
252 million years ago.
[112]
During the recovery from this catastrophe,
archosaurs
became the most abundant land vertebrates;
[113]
one archosaur group, the
dinosaurs
, dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
[114]
After the
Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event
66 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs,
[115]
mammals
increased rapidly in size and diversity
.
[116]
Such
mass extinctions
may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.
[117]
Diversity
Bacteria and Archaea
Further information:
Microbiology
Bacteria
-
Gemmatimonas aurantiaca
(-=1 Micrometer)
Bacteria
are a type of
cell
that constitute a large
domain
of
prokaryotic
microorganisms
. Typically a few
micrometers
in length, bacteria have a
number of shapes
, ranging from
spheres
to
rods
and
spirals
. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on
Earth
, and are present in most of its
habitats
. Bacteria inhabit soil, water,
acidic hot springs
,
radioactive waste
,
[118]
and the
deep biosphere
of the
Earth's crust
. Bacteria also live in
symbiotic
and
parasitic
relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the
bacterial phyla
have species that can be
grown
in the laboratory.
[119]
Archaea
-
Halobacteria
Archaea
constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially
classified
as
bacteria
, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria
kingdom
), a term that has fallen out of use.
[120]
Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other
two domains
,
Bacteria
and
Eukaryota
. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized
phyla
. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the flat and square cells of
Haloquadratum walsbyi
.
[121]
Despite this
morphological
similarity to bacteria, archaea possess
genes
and several
metabolic pathways
that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the
enzymes
involved in
transcription
and
translation
. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on
ether lipids
in their
cell membranes
,
[122]
including
archaeols
. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from
organic compounds
, such as sugars, to
ammonia
,
metal ions
or even
hydrogen gas
.
Salt-tolerant
archaea (the
Haloarchaea
) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea
fix carbon
, but unlike plants and
cyanobacteria
, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea
reproduce asexually
by
binary fission
,
fragmentation
, or
budding
; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form
endospores
.
The first observed archaea were
extremophiles
, living in extreme environments, such as
hot springs
and
salt lakes
with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every
habitat
, including soil, oceans, and
marshlands
. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in
plankton
may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.
Archaea are a major part of
Earth's life
. They are part of the
microbiota
of all organisms. In the
human microbiome
, they are important in the
gut
, mouth, and on the skin.
[123]
Their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and
syntrophic
communities, for example.
[124]
Eukaryotes
Main article:
Eukaryote
Euglena
, a single-celled eukaryote that can both move and photosynthesize
Eukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their
endosymbioses
with bacteria (or
symbiogenesis
) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells.
[125]
The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the
Precambrian
about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major
clades
:
alveolates
,
excavates
,
stramenopiles
,
plants
,
rhizarians
,
amoebozoans
,
fungi
, and
animals
.
[125]
Five of these clades are collectively known as
protists
, which are mostly microscopic
eukaryotic
organisms
that are not plants, fungi, or animals.
[125]
While it is likely that protists share a
common ancestor
(the
last eukaryotic common ancestor
),
[126]
protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. Like groupings such as
algae
,
invertebrates
, or
protozoans
, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience.
[125]
[127]
Most protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes.
[125]
Plants
are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly
photosynthetic
eukaryotes
of the
kingdom
Plantae, which would exclude
fungi
and some
algae
. Plant cells were derived by endosymbiosis of a
cyanobacterium
into an early eukaryote about one billion years ago, which gave rise to chloroplasts.
[128]
The first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic
photosynthetic
eukaryotic
organisms
are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related.
[128]
Algae comprise several distinct clades such as
glaucophytes
, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae.
[128]
Unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as
red
and
green algae
are multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades:
chlorophytes
,
coleochaetophytes
, and
stoneworts
.
[128]
Fungi
are eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies,
[129]
secreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes. Many fungi are also
saprobes
, feeding on dead organic matter, making them important
decomposers
in ecological systems.
[129]
Animals
are multicellular eukaryotes. With few exceptions, animals
consume organic material
,
breathe oxygen
, are
able to move
, can
reproduce sexually
, and grow from a hollow sphere of
cells
, the
blastula
, during
embryonic development
. Over 1.5 million
living
animal
species
have been
described
—of which around 1 million are
insects
—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. They have
complex interactions
with each other and their environments, forming intricate
food webs
.
[130]
Viruses
Main article:
Virus
Bacteriophages
attached to a bacterial cell wall
Viruses
are
submicroscopic
infectious agents
that
replicate
inside the
cells
of
organisms
.
[131]
Viruses infect all types of
life forms
, from animals and plants to
microorganisms
, including
bacteria
and
archaea
.
[132]
[133]
More than 6,000
virus species
have been described in detail.
[134]
Viruses are found in almost every
ecosystem
on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.
[135]
[136]
The origins of viruses in the
evolutionary history of life
are unclear: some may have
evolved
from
plasmids
—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of
horizontal gene transfer
, which increases
genetic diversity
in a way analogous to
sexual reproduction
.
[137]
Because viruses possess some but not all characteristics of life, they have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",
[138]
and as
self-replicators
.
[139]
Ecology
Main article:
Ecology
Ecology
is the study of the distribution and abundance of
life
, the interaction between organisms and their
environment
.
[140]
Ecosystems
Main article:
Ecosystem
The
community
of living (
biotic
) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (
abiotic
) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature,
humidity
,
atmosphere
,
acidity
, and soil) of their environment is called an
ecosystem
.
[141]
[142]
[143]
These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.
[144]
Energy from the sun enters the system through
photosynthesis
and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and on one another, animals move
matter
and
energy
through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and
microbial
biomass
present. By breaking down dead
organic matter
,
decomposers
release
carbon
back to the atmosphere and facilitate
nutrient cycling
by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes.
[145]
Populations
Main article:
Population ecology
Reaching carrying capacity through a logistic growth curve
A
population
is the group of
organisms
of the same
species
that occupies an
area
and
reproduce
from generation to generation.
[146]
[147]
[148]
[149]
[150]
Population size
can be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume. The carrying capacity of an
environment
is the maximum population size of a
species
that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food,
habitat
,
water
, and other
resources
that are available.
[151]
The carrying capacity of a population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes in the availability resources and the cost of maintaining them. In
human populations
, new
technologies
such as the
Green revolution
have helped increase the Earth's carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which was by
Thomas Malthus
in the 18th century.
[146]
Communities
Main article:
Community (ecology)
A (a) trophic pyramid and a (b) simplified food web. The trophic pyramid represents the biomass at each level.
[152]
A community is a group of
populations
of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time. A
biological interaction
is the effect that a pair of
organisms
living together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions). These effects may be short-term, like
pollination
and
predation
, or long-term; both often strongly influence the
evolution
of the species involved. A long-term interaction is called a
symbiosis
. Symbioses range from
mutualism
, beneficial to both partners, to
competition
, harmful to both partners.
[153]
Every species participates as a consumer, resource, or both in
consumer-resource interactions
, which form the core of
food chains
or
food webs
.
[154]
There are different
trophic levels
within any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or
autotrophs
) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into
organic compounds
, which can then be used by the rest of the community.
[51]
[155]
[156]
At the next level are the
heterotrophs
, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms.
[154]
Heterotrophs that consume plants are primary consumers (or
herbivores
) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or
carnivores
). And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on.
Omnivorous
heterotrophs are able to consume at multiple levels. Finally, there are
decomposers
that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms.
[154]
On average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the
biomass
of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes. Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level.
[157]
Biosphere
Main article:
Biosphere
Fast carbon cycle
showing the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. Effects of the
slow carbon cycle
, such as volcanic and tectonic activity, are not included.
[158]
In the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.
[159]
For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A
biogeochemical cycle
is a pathway by which specific
elements
of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (
biosphere
) and the abiotic (
lithosphere
,
atmosphere
, and
hydrosphere
) compartments of
Earth
. There are biogeochemical cycles for
nitrogen
,
carbon
, and
water
.
Conservation
Main article:
Conservation biology
Conservation biology is the study of the conservation of
Earth
's
biodiversity
with the aim of protecting
species
, their
habitats
, and
ecosystems
from excessive rates of
extinction
and the erosion of biotic interactions.
[160]
[161]
[162]
It is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender
genetic
,
population
,
species
, and ecosystem diversity.
[163]
[164]
[165]
[166]
The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,
[167]
which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.
[168]
[169]
Biodiversity
affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of
services
upon which people depend. Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of
biodiversity loss
, species
extinctions
, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to
sustain
the well-being of human society. Organizations and citizens are responding to the
current biodiversity crisis
through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.

Catholic ecclesiastical territory in Georgia and Armenia
The
Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus
(
Latin
:
Administratio Apostolica Caucasi Latinorum
) is an
apostolic administration
(pre-diocesan jurisdiction) of the
Latin Church
in the
Catholic Church
, established in 1993, with headquarters in
Tbilisi
, capital of Georgia.
It is exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, and to its
Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches
, not part of any ecclesiastical province. Since 1996,
Giuseppe Pasotto
is the founding Apostolic Administrator of the Caucasus.
History
[
edit
]
The Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus was erected on 30 December 1993, during the pontificate of
Pope John Paul II
by the decree Quo aptius of the
Congregation for Bishops
.
[1]
to pastorally cover Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, a territory split off from the
Apostolic Administration of European Russia
.
On 11 October 2000, it lost jurisdiction over
Azerbaijan
, which was transferred to the newly erected then
Mission sui iuris of Baku
, which soon was promoted to Apostolic prefecture.
It enjoyed papal visits by
Pope John Paul II
(July 1999, November 1999 and September 2001)  and
Pope Francis
(June, September and October 2016).
Cathedral see
[
edit
]
The
cathedral
episcopal see of the Apostolic Administration is the
Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin
in Tbilisi (capital of Georgia), dedicated to the
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
.
Territory
[
edit
]
The Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus pastorally serves Catholics of the Roman Rite of the whole of
Armenia
and
Georgia
(including
Adjara
), and the partially recognized states of
Abkhazia
and

Thomas Thirlby
(or
Thirleby
;
c.
1506
-1570), was the first and only
bishop of Westminster
(1540-50), and afterwards successively
bishop of Norwich
(1550-54) and
bishop of Ely
(1554-59). While he acquiesced in the
Henrician schism
, with its rejection in principle of the
Roman papacy
, he remained otherwise loyal to the doctrine of the
Roman Catholic Church
during the
English Reformation
.
Life
[
edit
]
Thomas, was the son of John Thirleby,
scrivener
and
town clerk
of
Cambridge
, and Joan his wife, and was born in the
parish
of
St. Mary the Great, Cambridge
, in or about 1506.
[1]
He received his education at
Trinity Hall, Cambridge
, graduated
bachelor of the civil law
in 1521, was elected a
fellow
of his college, and proceeded
doctor of the civil law
in 1528, and
doctor of the canon law
in 1530. It is said that while at the university he, with other learned men who were the favourers of the
gospel
, though they afterwards relapsed, received an allowance from Queen
Anne Boleyn
, the
Earl of Wiltshire
, her father, and
Lord Rochford
, her brother.
[2]
In 1532 he was official to the
archdeacon of Ely
.
[3]
He appears to have taken a prominent part in the affairs of the university between 1528 and 1534, and is supposed to have held the office of commissary. In 1534 he was appointed
provost
of the
collegiate church
of St. Edmund at
Salisbury
.
[4]
Archbishop Cranmer
and
Dr. Butts
, physician to the
king
, were his early patrons. Cranmer "liked his learning and his qualities so well that he became his good lord towards the king's majesty, and commended him to him, to be a man worthy to serve a prince, for such singular qualities as were in him. And indeed the king soon employed him in embassies in France and elsewhere: so that he grew in the king's favour by the means of the archbishop, who had a very extraordinary love for him, and thought nothing too much to give him or to do for him."
In 1533 he was one of the king's chaplains, and in May communicated to Cranmer "the king's commands" relative to the sentence of divorce from
Catherine of Aragon
. In 1534 he was presented by the king to the archdeaconry of Ely, and he was a member of the convocation which recognised the
king's supremacy
in ecclesiastical matters. Soon afterwards he was appointed
dean of the chapel royal
, and in 1536 one of the members of the
council of the north
. On 29 September 1537 the king granted to him a
canonry
and
prebend
in the
collegiate church of St. Stephen
, in the
palace of Westminster
,
[5]
and on the 15th of the following month he was present at the
christening
of Prince Edward (afterwards
Edward VI
) at
Hampton Court
.
[6]
On 2 May 1538 a royal commission was issued to
Stephen Gardiner
,
Sir Francis Brian
, and Thirlby, as ambassadors, to treat with
Francis I, king of France
, not only for a league of friendship, but for the projected marriage of the
Princess Mary
to the
Duke of Orleans
.
[7]
[8]
The three ambassadors were recalled in August 1538. Thirlby was one of the royal commissioners appointed on 1 October 1538 to search for and examine
anabaptists
.
[9]
On 23 December 1539 he was presented to the mastership of the
hospital of St. Thomas à Becket in Southwark
, and on 14 January 1539/40 he surrendered that house, with all its possessions, to the king. At this period he was
prebendary
of Yeatminster in the
cathedral church of Salisbury
, and
rector
of
Ribchester
,
Lancashire
. In 1540 he was
prolocutor
of the
convocation of the province of Canterbury
, and signed the decree declaring the
nullity
of the king's marriage with
Anne of Cleves
. In the same year he was one of the commissioners appointed by the king to deliberate upon sundry points of religion then in controversy, and especially upon the doctrine of the sacraments.
By
letters patent
dated 17 December 1540 the king erected the
abbey of Westminster
into an
episcopal see
, and appointed Thirlby the first and, as it happened, the last bishop of the new
Diocese of Westminster
. He was
consecrated
on 29 December in St. Saviour's Chapel in the cathedral church of Westminster.
[10]
Soon afterwards he was appointed by the convocation to revise the translation of the
epistles
of
St. James
,
St. John
, and
St. Jude
. In January 1540-1 he interceded with the crown for the grant of the university of the house of Franciscan friars at Cambridge. In 1542 he appears as a member of the
privy council
, and was also despatched as
ambassador
to the
emperor
in
Spain
.
[11]
He returned the same year. In April 1543 he took part in the revision of the "
Institution of a Christian Man
", and on 17 June in that year he was one of those empowered to treat with the Scots ambassador concerning the proposed marriage of
Prince Edward
with
Mary Queen of Scots
. In May 1545 he was despatched on an embassy to the emperor, Charles V.
[12]
He attended the
diet
of
Bourbourg
, and on 16 January 1546-7 he was one of those who signed a
treaty of peace
at
Utrecht
.
[13]
He was not named an
executor
by
Henry VIII
and consequently was excluded from
Edward VI's
privy council. He remained at the
court
of the
emperor
till June 1548, taking leave of
Charles V
at
Augsburg
on the 11th.
[14]
Thirlby took part in the important debates in the
House of Lords
in December 1548 and January 1548-9 on the subject of the
sacrament of the altar
and the
sacrifice of the mass
. He declared that "he did never allow the doctrine" laid down in the communion office of the proposed first
Book of Common Prayer
, stating that he mainly objected to the book as it stood because it abolished the "elevation" and the "adoration".
[15]
When
Somerset
expressed to Edward VI some disappointment at Thirlby's attitude, the young king remarked, "I expected nothing else but that he, who had been so long time with the emperor, should smell of the Interim."
[16]
He voted against the third reading of the
act of uniformity
on 15 January 1548-9, but enforced its provisions in his diocese after it had been passed. On 12 April 1549 he was in the commission for the suppression of heresy, and on 10 November in that year he was ambassador at Brussels with
Sir Philip Hoby
and
Sir Thomas Cheyne
. On 29 March 1550 Thirlby resigned the bishopric of Westminster into the hands of the king, who thereupon dissolved it, and reannexed the
county of Middlesex
, which had been assigned for its diocese, to the
see of London
.
[17]
While bishop of Westminster he is said to have "impoverished the church."
[18]
On 1 April, following his resignation of the see of Westminster, he was constituted
bishop of Norwich
.
[19]
Bishop Burnet
intimates that Thirlby was removed from Westminster to Norwich, as it was thought he could do less mischief in the latter see, "for though he complied as soon as any change was made, yet he secretly opposed everything while it was safe to do."
[20]
In January 1550-1 he was appointed one of the commissioners to correct and punish all anabaptists, and such as did not duly administer the sacraments according to the Book of Common Prayer; and on 15 April 1551 one of the commissioners to determine a controversy respecting the borders of England and Scotland. On 20 May following he was in a commission to treat for a marriage between the
king
and
Elizabeth
, daughter of
Henry II of France
. He was in 1551 appointed one of the
masters of requests
, and he was also one of the numerous witnesses on the trial of
Gardiner
,
bishop of Winchester
, which took place in that year. In January and March 1551-2 his name was inserted in several commissions appointed to inquire what sums were due to the king or his father for sale of lands; to raise money by the sale of crown lands to the yearly value of 1,000
£
; and to survey the state of all the courts erected for the custody of the king's lands. In April 1553 he was again appointed ambassador to the Emperor Charles V, at whose court he remained until April 1554.
[21]
On his return from
Germany
he brought with him one Remegius, who established a
paper mill
in this country—perhaps at
Fen Ditton
, near Cambridge.
[22]
At heart a Roman Catholic, Thirlby was soon high in
Queen Mary's
favour, and in July 1554 he was
translated
from Norwich to
Ely
, the
temporalities
of the latter see being delivered to him on 15 September.
[23]
He was one of the prelates who presided at the trials of
Bishop Hooper
,
John Rogers
,
Rowland Taylor
, and others, for heresy; and in February 1554-5 he was appointed, together with
Anthony Browne, viscount Montague
, and
Sir Edward Carne
, a special ambassador to the pope, to make the queen's obedience, and to obtain a confirmation of all those graces which
Cardinal Pole
had granted in his name. He returned to London from Rome on 24 August 1555 with a
bull
confirming the queen's title to Ireland, which document he delivered to the
lord treasurer
on 10 December. A curious journal of this embassy is printed in
Lord Hardwicke's
State Papers
.
[24]
After the death of the lord chancellor,
Gardiner
, on 12 November 1555, Mary proposed to confer on Thirlby the vacant office, but
Philip
objected, and
Archbishop Heath
was appointed.
[25]
In January 1555-6 Thirlby took a part in the degradation of his old friend Archbishop Cranmer. "He was observed to weep much all the while; he protested to Cranmer that it was the most sorrowful action of his whole life, and acknowledged the great love and friendship that had been between them; and that no earthly consideration but the queen's command could have induced him to come and do what they were then about."
[26]
On 22 March following he was one of the seven bishops who assisted at the consecration of Cardinal Pole as
archbishop of Canterbury
. In 1556 he was appointed to receive
Osep Napea Gregoriwitch
(
ru
), ambassador from the
emperor of Russia
. Thirlby appears to have sanctioned the burning of
John Hullier
for heresy in 1556, but only two others, William Wolsey and Robert Pygot of
Wisbech
, suffered death in his diocese on account of their religion, and it has been said that "Thirleby was in no way interested therein; but the guilt thereof must be shared between Dr. Fuller, the chancellor, and other commissioners."
[27]
[28]
In April 1558 Thirlby was sent to the north to inquire the cause of the quarrel between the
Earls
of
Northumberland
and
Westmoreland
. He and Dr.
Nicholas Wotton
were Queen Mary's commissioners to treat with France respecting the restoration of
Calais
and the conclusion of peace.
Queen Elizabeth
sent a new commission to them at
Cambray
in January 1558-9, and instructed the
Earl of Arundel
to act in conjunction with them. The commissioners succeeded in concluding peace, and returned home in April 1559. The queen is said to have cast upon Thirlby the entire blame of the eventual loss of Calais.
[29]
Queen Mary had appointed him one of her executors.
On the assembling of Queen Elizabeth's first parliament Thirlby sent his proxy, he being then absent on his embassy in France. On 17 April 1559 the bill for restoring ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the crown was committed to him and other peers. He opposed this measure on the third reading. He also dissented from the bill for uniformity of common prayer.
[30]
He refused to take the
oath of supremacy
, and for this reason he and Archbishop Heath were deposed from their sees on 5 July 1559 at the
lord-treasurer's
house in
Broad Street
.
According to
Bentham
, Thirlby was a considerable
benefactor
to the
see of Ely
because by his interest he procured from the
crown
for himself and his successors the patronage of the
prebends
in the
cathedral
; but
Dr. Cox
, his immediate successor, asserted that although Thirlby received
£
500 from
Bishop Goodrich's
executors
for
dilapidations
, he left his houses, bridges,
lodes
, rivers,
causeways
, and
banks
, in great ruin and decay, and spoiled the see of a stock of one thousand
marks
, which his predecessors had enjoyed since the reign of
Edward III
. He also alleged that Thirlby never came into his diocese.
[31]
After his deprivation Thirlby had his liberty for some time, but in consequence of his persisting in preaching against the Reformation, he was on 3 June 1560 committed to the
Tower
, and on 25 February 1560-1 he was
excommunicated
.
[32]
In September 1563 he was removed from the Tower on account of the plague to
Archbishop Parker's
house at
Beaksbourne
.
[33]
In June 1564 he was transferred to
Lambeth Palace
, and Parker, who is said to have treated Thirlby with great courtesy and respect, even permitted him to lodge for some time at the house of one Mrs. Blackwell in
Blackfriars
. He died in
Lambeth Palace
on 26 August 1570. He was buried on the 28th in the chancel of Lambeth church, under a stone with a brief Latin inscription in brass.
[34]
In making a grave for the burial of
Archbishop Cornwallis
in March 1783, the body of Bishop Thirlby was discovered in his coffin, in a great measure undecayed, as was the clothing. The corpse had a cap on its head and a hat under its arm.
[35]
His portrait is in the print of the delivery of the charter of
Bridewell
.

John Ramsbottom
(11 September 1814 - 20 May 1897) was an English
mechanical engineer
. Born in
Todmorden
, then on the county border of
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
. He was the Chief Mechanical Engineer for the
London and North Western Railway
for 14 years. He created many inventions for railways but his main legacy is the split metal
piston ring
, virtually all
reciprocating engines
continue to use these today.
Early life
[
edit
]
John Ramsbottom was born on 11 September 1814 in
Todmorden
. He was the third child of six and the youngest son.
[1]
His parents were Henry and Sarah Ramsbottom, Henry was a cotton spinner. His grandfather was John Ramsbottom, a tailor.
[2]
He had little in the way of schooling having "a short time spent in a dame's school he went to four schoolmasters in succession, then to a baptist minister, then to a colleague of the latter, who taught him as far as simple equations".
[3]
Todmorden
[
edit
]
His grandfather and father leased land in the Salford area of Todmorden, and in 1804-1805 established the "Steam Factory", the first steam powered cotton spinning mill in Todmorden.
[a]
[4]
His father gave him a lathe which he used to construct models of various steam engines for his own education and to entertain friends. He used these skills in the workplace rebuilding and modifying the mill engine. He was interested in other technologies, installing the 'new' coal gas illumination in the mill and manufacturing a machine to produce cut nails.
[3]
In partnership with his uncle, Richard Holt, he took out a patent (No. 6644) in 1834 for an improvement to a power loom, described in Pennie (2007) as a "vertical loom and weft-fork".
[5]
[6]
In 1836 he took out another patent (No. 6975) for "roving, spinning and doubling of fibres".
[5]
Manchester
[
edit
]
In 1839 he went as a journeyman to
Sharp, Roberts & Co.
in Manchester. The company manufactured textile machinery and machine tools at their Atlas Works in Manchester.
[7]
By the time Ramsbottom joined them they were also a successful manufacturer of steam locomotives and here he "gained practical knowledge of the design and construction of steam locomotives".
[8]
Three years later, in May 1842, on the recommendation of
Charles Beyer
(later to become co-founder of
Beyer, Peacock and Company
in 1854) Ramsbottom was appointed locomotive superintendent of the newly opened
Manchester and Birmingham Railway
(M&BR) at their new works at
Longsight
, Manchester. In November 1843 he was promoted to take charge of the newly formed locomotive and rolling stock department when the M&BR separated their civil and mechanical engineering departments, at a salary of £170.
[9]
[10]
In 1846 the M&BR merged and became part of the
London and North Western Railway
(L&NWR), and Ramsbottom became District Superintendent North Eastern Division, remaining at Longsight at an increased salary of £300.
[11]

[

In 1857 the North and North Eastern divisions of the L&NWR were amalgamated into the Northern Division (lines north of
Rugby
), Ramsbottom became Northern locomotive superintendent, based at
Crewe works
.
[11]
In 1862 the L&NWR Northern and Southern divisions were amalgamated with Ramsbottom becoming Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) for the whole system. Shortly after a Bessemer Steel Works was authorised for installation at Crewe so that the L&NWR could produce its own steel for locomotive construction and rails.
[12]
During his time as CME he oversaw the enlargement and modernisation of Crewe works, he was responsible for the
bulk production of cheap but capable locomotives
, introduced ancillary works including the steel plant and a brickworks, and installed an internal narrow-gauge railway to facilitate the movement of material.
[13]
[14]
Post L&NWR
[
edit
]
Ramsbottom retired in 1871 ostensibly because of ill health but likely because his request for a salary increase was turned down by the L&NWR Board of Directors.
[15]
The L&NWR continued to pay Ramsbottom an annual stipend of £1,000 for several years after he left, valuing his expertise as a consultant if not as an employee.
[16]
However, in 1883 Ramsbottom became a consulting engineer and a director of the
Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
(L&YR), where his major legacy was the establishment of
Horwich Works
on a greenfield site near Bolton.

Australian politician
For the English churchman, see
John Pedder (priest)
.
Sir John Lewes Pedder
(10 February 1784 - 24 March 1859) was an
English Australian
judge, politician and grazier, he was the first
Chief Justice of Van Diemen's Land
(now
Tasmania
).
Early life
[
edit
]
Pedder was born in
London
, the eldest son of John Pedder, a barrister.
[1]
Pedder junior was educated at
Charterhouse
and the
Middle Temple
from 1818 where he was
called to the bar
in 1820.
[1]
Then he entered
Trinity Hall
,
Cambridge
, graduating
LL.B.
in 1822.
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
Pedder was appointed Chief Justice of Van Diemen's Land on 18 August 1823.
[3]
Pedder sailed in the
Hibernia
, arriving in
Hobart
with his wife Maria, a daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Everett,
[1]
on 15 March 1824.
[1]
Also on the ship were
Joseph Gellibrand
, the first
Attorney-General of Van Dieman's land
and
Saxe Bannister
, the first
Attorney-General of New South Wales
. Trial by jury was a contentious issue in the colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land and each were immediately involved.
[4]
John Bigge
conducted an inquiry from 1819 to 1821 into the colonies of NSW and Van Diemen's Land. Bigge's 1823 report on judicial establishments recommended against trial by a civilian jury,
[5]
and the
House of Commons
had narrowly defeated a proposal that juries be introduced for criminal trials, prior to passing the
New South Wales Act 1823
which prescribed military juries for criminal trials before the Supreme Court and that convicts could be tried summarily. Nothing was said of the procedure before courts of
quarter sessions
. Both Gellibrand and Bannister were of the opinion that courts of quarter sessions could not try free persons without juries.
[4]
On 24 May 1824 Gellibrand in his inaugural address to the Supreme Court, spoke of trial by jury as being "one of the greatest boons conferred by the legislature upon this colony".
[6]
The issue of trial by jury was first argued before the newly established
Supreme Court of New South Wales
and
Chief Justice
Forbes
held that civilian juries were required for Court of Quarter Sessions.
[7]
Despite his initial address, Gellibrand subsequently vacillated in his views. In July 1825 the issue came before the
Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land
, with the Second
Law officer of the Crown
,
Solicitor-General
Alfred Stephen
, seeking an order requiring juries to be assembled while Gellibrand as the 1st Law Officer opposed it. Pedder, in a long and weighty judgment took a different view to Forbes, holding that the right to trial by civilian  jury was taken away by section 19 of the
New South Wales Act
1823.
[8]
As Chief Justice, Pedder was automatically a member of the
Legislative Council
and the Executive Council, which necessitated a very close relationship with
Governor Arthur
and even led to him being referred to as belonging to the "government party". The Chief Justice should not have been put into such a position, and in 1851, when the new partly elected legislative council was formed, the Chief Justice was no longer one of the government nominee members.
James Fenton
, in referring to this, says that, although Pedder was "a very useful member of the old council", he was "now wisely removed from the disturbing arena of political strife".
[9]
On 19 July 1854 Pedder had a paralytic seizure while on the bench, and shortly afterwards retired on a pension of £1500 a year under an act passed in the previous May. Pedder's wife died on 23 October 1855 after suffering from paralysis.
[1]
Pedder returned to
England
and died in
Brighton
on 24 March 1859. He was knighted in 1838. As a judge he has been called slow in decision and fearful of overstepping the written word of a statute. He was not a great lawyer, but he was upright and thorough, always careful that the accused should suffer no injustice. Fenton, who had personal knowledge of him, says that his "prudence and foresight often prevented grave injustice and dangerous blunders in the administration of affairs under the peculiar and difficult conditions of a colony half bond and half free".

Electrical circuit with negligible impedance
For other uses, see
Short circuit (disambiguation)
.
Tree limbs cause a short circuit, triggering an
electrical arc
during a storm
A
short circuit
(sometimes abbreviated to
short
or
s/c
) is an
electrical circuit
that allows a
current
to travel along an unintended path with no or very low
electrical impedance
. This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.
The opposite of a short circuit is an
open circuit
, which is an infinite
resistance
(or very
high impedance
) between two nodes.
Definition
[
edit
]
A short circuit is an abnormal connection between two nodes of an electric circuit intended to be at different voltages. This results in an
electric current
limited only by the
Thévenin equivalent resistance
of the rest of the network which can cause circuit damage,
overheating
,
fire
or
explosion
. Although usually the result of a
fault
, there are cases where short circuits are caused intentionally, for example, for the purpose of voltage-sensing
crowbar circuit protectors
.
In
circuit analysis
, a
short circuit
is defined as a connection between two nodes that forces them to be at the same voltage. In an 'ideal' short circuit, this means there is no resistance and thus no voltage drop across the connection. In real circuits, the result is a connection with almost no resistance. In such a case, the current is limited only by the resistance of the rest of the circuit.
Examples
[
edit
]
A common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a
battery
are connected with a low-
resistance
conductor
, like a
wire
.  With a low resistance in the connection, a high
current
will flow, causing the delivery of a large amount of
energy
in a short period of time.
A high current flowing through a battery can cause a rapid increase of temperature, potentially resulting in an explosion with the release of
hydrogen
gas and
electrolyte
(an
acid
or a
base
), which can burn tissue and cause blindness or even death. Overloaded wires will also
overheat
causing damage to the wire's insulation, or starting a fire.
In electrical devices, unintentional short circuits are usually caused when a wire's
insulation
breaks down, or when another conducting material is introduced, allowing charge to flow along a different path than the one intended.
In
mains
circuits, short circuits may occur between two
phases
, between a phase and
neutral
or between a phase and
earth
(ground).  Such short circuits are likely to result in a very high current and therefore quickly trigger an overcurrent protection device. However, it is possible for short circuits to arise between neutral and earth conductors and between two conductors of the same phase. Such short circuits can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. To help reduce the negative effects of short circuits, power distribution transformers are deliberately designed to have a certain amount of
leakage reactance
. The leakage reactance (usually about 5 to 10% of the full load impedance) helps limit both the magnitude and rate of rise of the fault current.
A short circuit may lead to formation of an
electric arc
. The arc, a channel of hot ionized
plasma
, is highly conductive and can persist even after significant amounts of original material from the conductors has evaporated. Surface erosion is a typical sign of electric arc damage. Even short arcs can remove significant amounts of material from the electrodes. The temperature of the resulting electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current, as well as to escape into the air as fine particulate matter.
[1]
Damage
[
edit
]
A short circuit fault current can, within milliseconds, be thousands of times larger than the normal operating current of the system.
[2]
Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing
fuses
,
circuit breakers
, or other
overload protection
, which disconnect the power in reaction to excessive current.  Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit.  Circuits for large
home appliances
require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits.
Wire gauges
specified in building and electrical
codes
are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection. An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum
prospective short-circuit current
.
In an improper installation, the overcurrent from a short circuit may cause
ohmic heating
of the circuit parts with poor conductivity (faulty joints in wiring, faulty contacts in power sockets, or even the site of the short circuit itself). Such
overheating
is a common cause of
fires
. An electric arc, if it forms during the short circuit, produces high amount of heat and can cause ignition of combustible substances as well.
In industrial and utility distribution systems, dynamic forces generated by high short-circuit currents cause conductors to spread apart. Busbars, cables, and apparatus can be damaged by the forces generated in a short circuit.
Related concepts
[
edit
]
In
electronics
, the ideal model (infinite
gain
) of an
operational amplifier
is said to produce a
virtual short circuit
between its input terminals because no matter what the output voltage is, the
difference of potential
between its input terminals is zero. If one of the input terminals is connected to the ground, then the other one is said to provide a
virtual ground
because its potential is (ideally) identical to that of the ground.
[3]
[4]
An ideal operational amplifier also has infinite
input impedance
, so unlike a real short circuit, no current flows between the terminals of the virtual short.

Elvis Aaron Presley
[a]
(January 8, 1935 - August 16, 1977), commonly referred by his first name, was an American singer and actor. Known as the "
King of Rock and Roll
", he is regarded as
one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century
. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a
transformative era in race relations
, brought both great success and
initial controversy
.
Presley was born in
Tupelo, Mississippi
, and relocated to
Memphis, Tennessee
, with his family at age 13. His music career began there in 1954, recording at
Sun Records
with producer
Sam Phillips
, who wanted to bring the sound of
African-American music
to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist
Scotty Moore
and bassist
Bill Black
, was a pioneer of
rockabilly
, an uptempo,
backbeat
-driven fusion of
country music
and
rhythm and blues
. In 1955, drummer
D. J. Fontana
joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and
RCA Victor
acquired his contract in a deal arranged by
Colonel Tom Parker
, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, "
Heartbreak Hotel
", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular
rock and roll
; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans
[6]
led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of
white American
youth.
[7]
In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in
Love Me Tender
. Drafted into
military service in 1958
, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making
Hollywood films
and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included
Jailhouse Rock
(1957),
Blue Hawaii
(1961), and
Viva Las Vegas
(1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special
Elvis
, which led to an extended
Las Vegas
concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world,
Aloha from Hawaii
. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and Presley died suddenly in 1977 at his
Graceland
estate at the age of 42.
Having sold roughly 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the
best-selling music artists
of all time. He was commercially successful in many genres, including
pop
, country, rhythm & blues,
adult contemporary
, and
gospel
. He won three
Grammy Awards
, received the
Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award
at age 36, and has been inducted into
multiple music halls of fame
. He also holds several records, including the most
RIAA
-certified
gold
and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the
Billboard
200
, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the
UK Albums Chart
, and the most number-one singles by any act on the
UK Singles Chart
. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom
.
Life and career
1935-1953: early years
Childhood in Tupelo
Presley's birthplace
in
Tupelo, Mississippi
Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in
Tupelo, Mississippi
, to Vernon Presley and Gladys Love (
née
Smith) Presley in a two-room
shotgun house
that his father built for the occasion.
[8]
Elvis'
identical twin
, Jesse Garon Presley, was delivered
stillborn
thirty-five minutes before him.
[9]
Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an
Assembly of God
church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.
[10]
Presley's parents
Presley's father was of Irish,
[11]
German,
[12]
Scottish, and English origins,
[13]
and a descendant of the
Harrison family of Virginia
.
[8]
Presley's mother Gladys was
Scots-Irish
with some Norman French ancestry.
[14]
She and the rest of the family believed that her great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was
Cherokee
.
[15]
[16]
[17]
This belief was restated by Elvis's granddaughter
Riley Keough
in 2017.
[18]
Elaine Dundy
, in her biography, supports the belief.
[19]
Vernon moved from one
odd job
to the next, showing little ambition.
[20]
[21]
The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938 they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of
altering a check
. He was jailed for eight months while Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.
[10]
In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as "average".
[22]
He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of
Red Foley
's
country
song "
Old Shep
" during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. The ten-year-old Presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth.
[23]
A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle.
[24]
[25]
Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very
shy
about it."
[26]
In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade; he was regarded as a
loner
. The following year, he began bringing his guitar to school. He played and sang during lunchtime and was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played
hillbilly music
.
[27]
Presley was a devotee of
Mississippi Slim
's show on the Tupelo radio station
WELO
. He was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, who was one of Presley's classmates and often took him into the station. Slim supplemented Presley's guitar instruction by demonstrating chord techniques.
[28]
When his
protégé
was aged 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.
[29]
Teenage life in Memphis
In November 1948, the family moved to
Memphis, Tennessee
. After residing for nearly a year in
rooming houses
, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the
public housing
complex known as the Lauderdale Courts.
[30]
Enrolled at
L. C. Humes High School
, Presley received only a C in
music
in eighth grade. When his music teacher told him that he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate his kind of singing".
[31]
He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally
bullied
by classmates who viewed him as a "mama's boy".
[32]
In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of
Lee Denson
, a neighbor. They and three other boys—including two future
rockabilly
pioneers, brothers
Dorsey
and
Johnny Burnette
—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.
[33]
That September, Presley began working as an usher at Loew's State Theater.
[34]
Other jobs followed at Precision Tool, another stint at Loew's, and MARL Metal Products.
[35]
During his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his
sideburns
and styled his hair with
rose oil
and
Vaseline
. In his free time, he would head down to
Beale Street
, the heart of Memphis' thriving
blues
scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of
Lansky Brothers
. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.
[36]
Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Courts, he competed in Humes' Annual "Minstrel" Show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with "
Till I Waltz Again with You
", a recent hit for
Teresa Brewer
. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation:
I wasn't popular in school ... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.
[37]
Presley, who received no formal music training and could not
read music
, studied and played by ear. He also visited record stores that provided
jukeboxes
and listening booths to customers. He knew all of
Hank Snow
's songs,
[38]
and he loved records by other country singers such as
Roy Acuff
,
Ernest Tubb
,
Ted Daffan
,
Jimmie Rodgers
,
Jimmie Davis
, and
Bob Wills
.
[39]
The
Southern gospel
singer
Jake Hess
, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his
ballad
-singing style.
[40]
[41]
Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American
spiritual music
.
[42]
He adored the music of black gospel singer
Sister Rosetta Tharpe
.
[39]
Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as
WDIA
, that played what were then called "race records":
spirituals
, blues, and the modern,
backbeat
-heavy sound of
rhythm and blues
.
[43]
Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences—a necessity in the
segregated South
.
[44]
Many of his future recordings were inspired by local
African-American musicians
such as
Arthur Crudup
and
Rufus Thomas
.
[45]
[46]
B.B. King
recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.
[47]
By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.
[48]
[49]
1953-1956: first recordings
Sam Phillips and Sun Records
See also:
List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label
Presley in a
Sun Records
promotional photograph, 1954
In August 1953, Presley checked into the offices of
Memphis Recording Service
, the company run by
Sam Phillips
before he started
Sun Records
. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided
acetate disc
: "
My Happiness
" and "
That's When Your Heartaches Begin
". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer
Peter Guralnick
argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by
receptionist
Marion Keisker
what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, "I sing all kinds." When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, "I don't sound like nobody." After he recorded, Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: "Good ballad singer. Hold."
[50]
In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—"I'll Never Stand in Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.
[51]
Not long after, he failed an
audition
for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows, explaining to his father, "They told me I couldn't sing."
[52]
Songfellow
Jim Hamill
later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.
[53]
In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.
[54]
His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact
Eddie Bond
, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving "because you're never going to make it as a singer".
[55]
Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the
Negro
sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.
'
"
[56]
In June, he acquired a demo recording by
Jimmy Sweeney
of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist
Winfield "Scotty" Moore
and
upright bass
player
Bill Black
, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.
[57]
"That's All Right"
Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a "lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence."
[58]
Problems playing this file? See
media help
.
The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "
That's All Right
". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.
'
" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.
[59]
Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey
Dewey Phillips
(no relation to Sam Phillips) played "That's All Right" on his
Red, Hot, and Blue
show.
[60]
Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.
[61]
During the next few days, the trio recorded a
bluegrass
song,
Bill Monroe
's "
Blue Moon of Kentucky
", again in a distinctive style and employing a
jury-rigged
echo effect
that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A-side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.
[62]
Early live performances and RCA Victor contract
The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954—Presley still sporting his child-size guitar.
[63]
At the end of the month, they appeared at the
Overton Park Shell
, with
Slim Whitman
headlining. Here Elvis pioneered '
Rubber Legs
', his signature style dance movement that he is best known for.
[64]
[65]
A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.
[66]
Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild".
[67]
Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as "really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something".
[67]
Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue on the second floor of the Clearpool recreation complex in Memphis. When Presley played his fifteen-minute sets, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house
western swing
band resumed.
[68]
Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."
[69]
Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.
[70]
Presley made what would be his only appearance on
Nashville
's
Grand Ole Opry
on October 2; after a polite audience response,
Opry
manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.
[71]
[72]
Louisiana Hayride
, radio commercial, and first television performances
In November 1954, Presley performed on
Louisiana Hayride
—the
Opry
'
s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The
Shreveport
-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.
[73]
House drummer
D. J. Fontana
brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in
strip clubs
.
[74]
Soon after the show, the
Hayride
engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a
Martin
instrument for $175 (equivalent to $1,900 in 2022) and his trio began playing in new locales, including
Houston
, Texas, and
Texarkana
, Arkansas.
[75]
Many fledgling performers, like
Minnie Pearl
,
Johnny Horton
, and
Johnny Cash
, sang the praises of
Louisiana Hayride
sponsor
Southern Maid Donuts
, including Presley, who developed a lifelong love of
donuts
.
[76]
Presley made his singular product endorsement commercial for the donut company, which was never released, recording a radio
jingle
"in exchange for a box of hot glazed doughnuts".
[77]
[78]
Presley made his first television appearance on the
KSLA-TV
television broadcast of
Louisiana Hayride
. Soon after, he failed an audition for
Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts
on the
CBS
television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular
Hayride
appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas.
[79]
[80]
In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of
Colonel Tom Parker
, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Parker, born in the Netherlands, had
immigrated illegally
to the U.S. and claimed to be from
West Virginia
; he had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from the
Louisiana
governor and country singer Jimmie Davis. Having successfully managed the top country star
Eddy Arnold
, Parker was working with the new number-one country singer,
Hank Snow
. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.
[79]
[80]
When the tour reached
Odessa, Texas
, a 19-year-old
Roy Orbison
saw Presley for the first time: "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing. ... I just didn't know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it."
[38]
By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".
[81]
This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a
hillbilly
."
[82]
The blend came to be known as "rockabilly". At the time, Presley was variously billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".
[83]
Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.
[84]
The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year.
[85]
Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him. They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something."
[86]
The trio became a quartet when
Hayride
drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of
Bill Haley
, whose "
Rock Around the Clock
" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.
[87]
At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.
[88]
Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with
RCA Victor
on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.
[89]
[b]
Presley, now aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.
[90]
Parker arranged with the owners of
Hill & Range
Publishing,
Jean
and
Julian Aberbach
, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary
royalties
in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.
[91]
[c]
By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.
[94]
1956-1958: commercial breakout and controversy
First national TV appearances and debut album
Billboard
magazine advertisement, March 10, 1956
On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in Nashville.
[95]
Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and
Hayride
pianist
Floyd Cramer
—who had been performing at live club dates with Presley—RCA enlisted guitarist
Chet Atkins
and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular
Jordanaires
quartet, to fill in the sound.
[96]
The session produced the moody, unusual "
Heartbreak Hotel
", released as a single on January 27.
[95]
Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's
Stage Show
for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers
Tommy
and
Jimmy Dorsey
. After his first appearance, on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a
cover
of
Carl Perkins
' rockabilly anthem "
Blue Suede Shoes
". In February, Presley's "
I Forgot to Remember to Forget
", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, reached the top of the
Billboard
country chart
.
[97]
Neal's contract was terminated, and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager.
[98]
RCA released Presley's
self-titled debut album
on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety. There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of
rock and roll
: "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic
Robert Hilburn
—and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of
Little Richard
,
Ray Charles
, and
The Drifters
. As described by Hilburn, these "were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases."
[99]
It became the first rock and roll album to top the
Billboard
chart, a position it held for ten weeks.
[95]
While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers
Bo Diddley
and
Chuck Berry
, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage
with a guitar in his hands
played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."
[100]
Milton Berle Show
and "Hound Dog"
Presley signing autographs in
Minneapolis
in 1956
On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on
NBC
's
The Milton Berle Show
. His performance, on the deck of the
USS
Hancock
in San Diego, California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.
[101]
A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.
[102]
Twelve weeks after its original release, "Heartbreak Hotel" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April he began a two-week
residency
at the
New Frontier Hotel and Casino
on the
Las Vegas Strip
.
[103]
The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests—"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", wrote a critic for
Newsweek
.
[104]
Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with
Paramount Pictures
.
[105]
He began a tour of the
Midwest
in mid-May, taking in fifteen cities in as many days.
[106]
He had attended several shows by
Freddie Bell and the Bellboys
in Vegas and was struck by their cover of "
Hound Dog
", a hit in 1953 for blues singer
Big Mama Thornton
by songwriters
Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller
. It became his new closing number.
[107]
After a show in
La Crosse
, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to
FBI
director
J. Edgar Hoover
. It warned that
Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.
[108]
Presley's second
Milton Berle Show
appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour.
Milton Berle
persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage, advising, "Let 'em see you, son."
[109]
During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of "Hound Dog" with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements.
[109]
His gyrations created a storm of controversy.
[110]
Television critics were outraged:
Jack Gould
of
The New York Times
wrote,
Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.
[111]
Ben Gross of the New York
Daily News
opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and
bordellos
".
[112]
Ed Sullivan
, whose
own variety show
was the nation's most popular, declared Presley "unfit for family viewing".
[113]
To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult".
[114]
Steve Allen Show
and first Sullivan appearance
Ed Sullivan and Presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on
The Ed Sullivan Show
, October 26, 1956
The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's
The Steve Allen Show
in New York. Allen, no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a
basset hound
wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition".
[115]
Allen later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and simply worked him into the customary "comedy fabric" of his program.
[116]
Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance."
[117]
Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.
[118]
Later that night, he appeared on
Hy Gardner Calling
, a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. ... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music. ... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"
[112]
The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", along with "
Any Way You Want Me
" and "
Don't Be Cruel
". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on
The Steve Allen Show
; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."
[119]
In August, a judge in
Jacksonville
, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.
[120]
The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for thirty-six years.
[121]
Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "
Love Me
".
[122]
Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten CBS's
The Ed Sullivan Show
in the ratings. Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.
[123]
The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.
[124]
Actor
Charles Laughton
hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.
[113]
Presley appeared in two segments that night from
CBS Television City
in Los Angeles. According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it's a
Coke
bottle. ... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"
[125]
Sullivan publicly told
TV Guide
, "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."
[123]
In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming.
[126]
[127]
Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "
Love Me Tender
", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.
[128]
More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on
The Ed Sullivan Show
that made Presley a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.
[113]
Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the "biggest pop craze" since
Glenn Miller
and
Frank Sinatra
and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: "As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture."
[129]
Crazed crowds and film debut

"We're gonna do a sad song ..."
Presley's definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor—here, during his second Sullivan appearance, he introduces one of his signature numbers.

The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."
[130]
At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty
National Guardsmen
were added to the police detail to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus.
[131]
Elvis
, Presley's second RCA album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear "in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique."
[132]
Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through
Elvis
, rock critic
Dave Marsh
wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."
[133]
Presley returned to
The Ed Sullivan Show
at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and
St. Louis
burned him in
effigy
.
[113]
His first motion picture,
Love Me Tender
, was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title—
The Reno Brothers
—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.
[105]
Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.
[134]
On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and
Jerry Lee Lewis
were recording, and had an impromptu
jam session
along with
Johnny Cash
. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the "
Million Dollar Quartet
" recordings.
[135]
The year ended with a front-page story in
The Wall Street Journal
reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales,
[136]
and
Billboard
'
s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.
[137]
In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.
[128]
Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice
Presley made his third and final
Ed Sullivan Show
appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.
[127]
[138]
In any event, as critic
Greil Marcus
describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a
pasha
, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing
Rudolph Valentino
in
The Sheik
, with all stops out."
[113]
To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, "
Peace in the Valley
". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy".
[139]
Two days later, the Memphis
draft board
announced that Presley would be
classified 1-A
and would probably be drafted sometime that year.
[140]
Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "
Too Much
", "
All Shook Up
", and "
(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear
". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released. Under the headline "Presley Records a Craze in Soviet",
The New York Times
reported that pressings of his music on
discarded X-ray plates
were commanding high prices in
Leningrad
.
[141]
Between film shoots and recording sessions, Presley purchased an 18-room mansion,
Graceland
, on March 19, 1957, for the amount of $102,500. The mansion, which was about 9 miles (14 km) south of downtown Memphis,
[142]
was for himself and his parents.
[143]
[144]
Before the purchase, Elvis recorded
Loving You
—the soundtrack to
his second film
, which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for
Jailhouse Rock
, Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the
Jailhouse
sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm".
[145]
"He was fast," said Leiber. "Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes."
[146]
The
title track
became another
number-one hit
, as was the
Jailhouse Rock
EP
.
[147]
Presley and costar
Judy Tyler
in the trailer for
Jailhouse Rock
, released in October 1957
Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.
[148]
A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed".
[149]
Villanova
students pelted the singer with eggs in
Philadelphia
,
[149]
and in
Vancouver
the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage.
[150]
Frank Sinatra, who had inspired both the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."
[151]
Asked for a response, Presley said, "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago."
[152]
Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of
Elvis' Christmas Album
. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: "
Santa Claus Is Back in Town
", an
innuendo
-laden blues.
[153]
The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the
best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States
,
[154]
[155]
with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide.
[156]
After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time.
[157]
On December 20, Presley received his draft notice. He was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film
King Creole
, in which $350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer
Hal Wallis
. A couple of weeks into the new year, "
Don't
", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. It had been only twenty-one months since "Heartbreak Hotel" had brought him to the top for the first time. Recording sessions for the
King Creole
soundtrack
were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs and were again on hand, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.
[158]
As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off: "He was removed. ... They kept him separate."
[159]
A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked another ending—it was the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.
[160]
He died in 1965.

1958-1960: military service and mother's death
Main article:
Military career of Elvis Presley
Presley being
sworn into the Army
on March 24, 1958, at
Fort Chaffee
On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the
United States Army
at
Fort Chaffee
in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the installation.
[162]
Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: "The Army can do anything it wants with me."
[163]
Between March 28 and September 17, 1958, Presley completed
basic
and advanced military training at
Fort Hood
in Texas, where he was temporarily assigned to Company A, 2d Medium Tank Battalion,
37th Armor
. During the two weeks'
leave
between his basic and advanced training in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville.
[164]
In early August, Presley's mother was diagnosed with
hepatitis
, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same;
[165]
[166]
their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.
[4]
Presley, wearing the
3d Armored Division
Shoulder Sleeve Insignia
, poses atop a tank at
Ray Barracks
On October 1, 1958, Presley was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion,
32d Armor
,
3d Armored Division
, at
Ray Barracks
,
West Germany
, where he served as an armor intelligence specialist.
[1]
On November 27, he was promoted to
private first class
and on June 1, 1959, to
specialist fourth class
. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to
amphetamines
by another soldier. He became "practically evangelical about their benefits", not only for energy but for "strength" and weight loss, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging.
[167]
The Army also introduced Presley to karate,
[168]
which he studied seriously, training with
Jürgen Seydel
.
[169]
[170]
It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances.
[171]
[172]
[173]
Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.
[174]
Presley was promoted to
sergeant
on February 11, 1960.
[1]
While in
Bad Nauheim
, Presley, aged 24 at the time, met 14-year-old
Priscilla Beaulieu
. Priscilla said that due to their age difference when they met, he told her: "Why, you're just a baby."
[175]
They would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell in the military would ruin his career. In
Special Services
, he would have been able to give musical performances and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a regular soldier.
[176]
Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA producer
Steve Sholes
and
Freddy Bienstock
of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases.
[177]
Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including "
Wear My Ring Around Your Neck
", the bestselling "
Hard Headed Woman
", and "
One Night
" in 1958, and "
(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I
" and the number-one "
A Big Hunk o' Love
" in 1959.
[178]
RCA also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully
Elvis' Golden Records
(1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.
[179]
1960-1968: focus on films

.
Presley returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was
honorably discharged
three days later.
[181]
The train that carried him from
New Jersey
to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans.
[182]
On the night of March 20, he entered
RCA's Nashville studio
to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, "
Stuck on You
", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number-one hit.
[183]
Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his bestselling singles, the ballads "
It's Now or Never
" and "
Are You Lonesome Tonight?
", along with the rest of
Elvis Is Back!
The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of
Chicago blues
"menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from
Boots Randolph
. Elvis' singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."
[184]
As a whole, the record "conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things", according to music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".
[185]
Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.
[186]
[187]
Presley with
Juliet Prowse
in
G.I. Blues
Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on
The Frank Sinatra Timex Special
—ironic for both stars, given Sinatra's earlier excoriation of rock and roll. Also known as
Welcome Home Elvis
, the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 fee for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.
[188]
G.I. Blues
, the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material,
His Hand in Mine
, followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, on behalf of twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.
[189]
A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album,
Something for Everybody
.
[190]
As described by John Robertson, it exemplifies the
Nashville sound
, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley himself over the next half-decade, the album is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright".
[191]
It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, raising money for a
Pearl Harbor
memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.
[192]
Lost in Hollywood
Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted
musical comedies
. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—
Flaming Star
(1960) and
Wild in the Country
(1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.
[193]
His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a "pantheon of bad taste".
[194]
Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable.
Hal Wallis
, who produced nine of them, declared, "A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood."
[195]
Of Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—Presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: "three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie".
[196]
As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew "progressively worse".
[197]
Julie Parrish
, who appeared in
Paradise, Hawaiian Style
(1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs chosen for his films.
[198]
The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it."
[199]
Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of
Doc Pomus
and
Mort Shuman
. But by and large, according to biographer
Jerry Hopkins
, the numbers seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll".
[200]
Regardless of the songs' quality, it has been argued that Presley generally sang them well, with commitment.
[201]
Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: "Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and '
Rock-A-Hula Baby
'."
[133]
In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as "
Can't Help Falling in Love
" (1961) and "
Return to Sender
" (1962). ("
Viva Las Vegas
", the title track to the 1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later.) But, as with artistic merit, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: "
Crying in the Chapel
" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of
Pot Luck
and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album
How Great Thou Art
(1967). It won him his first
Grammy Award
, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was "arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs".
[202]
Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the
Aladdin Hotel
in Las Vegas.
[203]
The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on. It was not until October 1967, when the
Clambake
soundtrack LP
registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA executives recognized a problem. "By then, of course, the damage had been done", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. "Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans."
[204]
1968-1973: comeback
Elvis
: the '68 Comeback Special
Main article:
Singer Presents...Elvis
The
'68 Comeback Special
produced "one of the most famous images" of Presley.
[205]
Taken on June 29, 1968, it was adapted for the cover of
Rolling Stone
in July 1969.
[205]
[206]
Presley's only child,
Lisa Marie
, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career.
[207]
Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28.
[208]
His forthcoming soundtrack album,
Speedway
, would rank at number 82 on the
Billboard
chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.
[209]
Recorded in late June in
Burbank, California
, the special, simply called
Elvis
, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the
'68 Comeback Special
, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer
Steve Binder
had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.
[210]
The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.
[211]
Jon Landau
of
Eye
magazine remarked, "There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made
Jim Morrison
green with envy."
[212]
Marsh calls the performance one of "emotional grandeur and historical resonance".
[213]
By January 1969, the single "
If I Can Dream
", written for the special, reached number 12. The
soundtrack album
rose into the top ten. According to friend
Jerry Schilling
, the special reminded Presley of what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison, man."
[211]
Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.
'
"
[211]

.
Buoyed by the experience of the
Comeback Special
, Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at
American Sound Studio
, which led to the acclaimed
From Elvis in Memphis
. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement."
[215]
The album featured the hit single "
In the Ghetto
", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since "Bossa Nova Baby" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: "
Suspicious Minds
", "
Don't Cry Daddy
", and "
Kentucky Rain
".
[216]
Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the
Comeback Special
, offers came in from around the world. The
London Palladium
offered Parker
US$
28,000
(equivalent to $223,000 in 2022) for a one-week engagement. He responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"
[217]
In May, the brand-new
International Hotel
in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, announced that it had booked Presley. He was scheduled to perform fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist
James Burton
and including two gospel groups,
The Imperials
and
Sweet Inspirations
.
[218]
Costume designer
Bill Belew
, responsible for the intense leather styling of the
Comeback Special
, created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.
[219]
Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, International Hotel owner
Kirk Kerkorian
arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.
[220]
Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't Help Falling in Love" (a song that would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).
[221]
At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as "The King", Presley gestured toward
Fats Domino
, who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."
[222]
The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.
[223]
Newsweek
commented, "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."
[224]
Rolling Stone
called Presley "supernatural, his own resurrection."
[225]
In November, Presley's final non-concert film,
Change of Habit
, opened. The double album
From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis
came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first
U.S. pop number-one
in over seven years, and his last.
[226]
Cassandra Peterson
, later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas, where she was working as a showgirl. She recalled of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked
marijuana
, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.
'
"
[227]
Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.
[228]
Back on tour and meeting Nixon
Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album
On Stage
.
[229]
In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record-breaking shows at the
Houston Astrodome
.
[230]
In April, the single "
The Wonder of You
" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S.
adult contemporary
chart, as well.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
(MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary
Elvis: That's the Way It Is
. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless
US$
50,000
(equivalent to $377,000 in 2022) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.
[231]
The FBI took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a
Derringer
in his right boot and a
.45 caliber
pistol
in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.
[232]
[233]
The album
That's the Way It Is
, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, "The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis."
[234]
After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the
South
, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the
West Coast
, followed in November.
[235]
Presley meets US President
Richard Nixon
in the White House Oval Office, December 21, 1970
On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President
Richard Nixon
at the
White House
, where he expressed his patriotism and explained how he believed he could reach out to the
hippies
to help combat the
drug culture
he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he "retain his credibility".
[236]
Presley told Nixon that
the Beatles
, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era,
[237]
exemplified what he saw as a trend of
anti-Americanism
.
[238]
Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in
Bel Air, California
, in August 1965. On hearing reports of the meeting,
Paul McCartney
later said that he "felt a bit betrayed. ... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's early death linked to
prescription drug abuse
.
[239]
Later Elvis would call the White House to speak with President Jimmy Carter to request a presidential pardon for a friend who had not yet been tried.
[240]
The
U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce
named Presley one of its annual
Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation
on January 16, 1971.
[241]
Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of
Highway 51 South
on which Graceland is located "Elvis Presley Boulevard". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the
Lifetime Achievement Award
(then known as the Bing Crosby Award) by the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences
, the Grammy Award organization.
[242]
[243]
Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971, as many as had come out over the previous eight years. Best received by critics was
Elvis Country
, a
concept record
that focused on genre standards.
[244]
The biggest seller was
Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas
, "the truest statement of all", according to Greil Marcus. "In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of "
Merry Christmas Baby
", a raunchy old
Charles Brown
blues.
[...] If [Presley's] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life".

MGM again filmed Presley in April 1972, this time for
Elvis on Tour
, which went on to win the
Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film
for
that year's Golden Globe Awards
. His gospel album
He Touched Me
, released that month, would earn him his second
Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance
, for
that year's Grammy Awards
. A fourteen-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's
Madison Square Garden
.
[246]
The evening concert on July 10 was recorded and issued in an LP form a week later.
Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden
became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single "
Burning Love
" was released—Presley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. "The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up
'
", wrote rock critic
Robert Christgau
. "Who else could make 'It's coming closer, the flames are now licking my body' sound like an assignation with
James Brown
's
backup band
?"
[247]
Presley came up with his outfit's eagle motif, as "something that would say 'America' to the world"
[248]
Presley and his wife, meanwhile, had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion.
[249]
He often raised the possibility of Joyce moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave Priscilla.
[250]
The Presleys
separated
on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with
Mike Stone
, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla related that when she told him, Presley raped her, declaring, "This is how a real man makes love to his woman".
[251]
She later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement.
[252]
Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend,
Linda Thompson
, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him.
[253]
Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18.
[254]
According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage "was a blow from which he never recovered".
[255]
At a rare press conference that June, a reporter had asked Presley whether he was satisfied with his image. Presley replied, "Well, the image is one thing and the human being another ... it's very hard to live up to an image."
[256]
In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the
Kui Lee
Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special,
Aloha from Hawaii
, which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14,
Aloha from Hawaii
aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records. The next night, it was simulcast to twenty-eight European countries, and in April an extended version finally aired in the U.S., where it won a fifty-seven percent share of the TV audience.
[257]
Over time, Parker's claim that it was seen by one billion or more people
[258]
would be broadly accepted,
[259]
[260]
[261]
but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention.
[262]
Presley's stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latter-day persona became closely associated. As described by
Bobbie Ann Mason
, "At the end of the show, when he spreads out his American Eagle cape, with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back, he becomes a god figure."
[263]
The
accompanying double album
, released in February, went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the U.S.
[264]
It was Presley's last
U.S. number-one pop album
during his lifetime.
[265]
At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone, Priscilla's lover, to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, "There's too much pain in me ... Stone [must] die." His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging,
Red West
, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a
contract killing
and was relieved when Presley decided, "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy."
[266]
1973-1977: health deterioration and death
Medical crises and last studio sessions
Presley's divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.
[267]
By then, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on
barbiturates
, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. Towards the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, semi-comatose from the effects of a
pethidine
addiction. According to his primary care physician,
George C. Nichopoulos
, Presley "felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street".
[268]
Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.
[269]
Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.
[270]
Presley's condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist
Tony Brown
remembered his arrival at a
University of Maryland
concert: "He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?"
[271]
Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up. ... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions."
[272]
RCA, which had always enjoyed a steady stream of product from Presley, began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.
[273]
Parker delivered RCA another concert record,
Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis
.
[274]
Recorded on March 20, it included a version of "
How Great Thou Art
" that won Presley his third and final
Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance
at
that year's Grammy Awards
.
[275]
[276]
All three of his competitive Grammy wins - out of fourteen total nominations - were for gospel recordings.
[276]
Presley returned to the recording studio in Hollywood in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.
[277]
In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at Presley's home.
[278]
However, the recording process had become a struggle for him.
[279]
"Hurt"
An R&B hit for
Roy Hamilton
in 1955 and a pop hit for

Timi Yuro

version was picked up by country radio in 1976.

Final months
Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."
[281]
According to Andy Greene of
Rolling Stone
, Presley's final performances were mostly "sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch."
[282]
In
Alexandria, Louisiana
, he was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand".
[283]
On March 31, he canceled a performance in
Baton Rouge
, unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.
[284]
Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his
spiritualism
books".
[285]
Presley's cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite
Monty Python
sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of the billionaire recluse
Howard Hughes
.
[286]
"
Way Down
", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special,
Elvis in Concert
, to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in
Omaha
on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project".
[287]
Two days later, in
Rapid City
, South Dakota, "he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was "framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks".
[287]
Presley's final concert was held in
Indianapolis
at
Market Square Arena
, on June 26, 1977.

On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to
Portland, Maine
, to begin another tour. That afternoon, however, his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion.
[289]
Biographer Joel Williamson suggests that "involving a reaction to the
codeine
" he had taken "and attempts to move his bowels—he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. Alarmed, he stood up ... and fell face down in the fetal position." Drooling on the rug and "unable to breathe, he died."
[290]
Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at
Baptist Memorial Hospital
at 3:30 p.m.
[291]
He was 42 years old.
[292]
President
Jimmy Carter
issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture".
[293]
Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted
US$
18,000
(equivalent to $87,000 in 2022) to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the
National Enquirer
'
s biggest-selling issue ever.
[294]
Alden struck a $105,000 (equivalent to $507,000 in 2022) deal with the
Enquirer
for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement.
[295]
Presley left her nothing in his
will
.
[296]
Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on Thursday, August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third.
[297]
About 80,000 people lined the processional route to
Forest Hill Cemetery
, where Presley was buried next to his mother.
[298]
Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and UK singles chart.
[299]
[300]
Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2. Presley is buried alongside his parents, daughter, grandson and his paternal grandmother in the Meditation Garden at Graceland.
[295]
Cause of death
While an
autopsy
, undertaken the same day Presley died, was still in progress, Memphis
medical examiner
Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest. Asked if drugs were involved, he declared that "drugs played no role in Presley's death".
[301]
In fact, "drug use was heavily implicated" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered "
anaphylactic shock
brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy". A pair of lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that
polypharmacy
was the primary cause of death; one reported "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity".
[302]
In 1979, forensic pathologist
Cyril Wecht
conducted a review of the reports and concluded that a combination of
depressants
had resulted in Presley's accidental death.
[301]
Forensic historian and pathologist
Michael Baden
viewed the situation as complicated: "Elvis had had an
enlarged heart
for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."
[303]
The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was
cardiac arrhythmia
, a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.
[301]
Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.
[303]
While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability for his death, the facts were startling: "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of
sedatives
,
amphetamines
, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name." Nichopoulos' license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.
[268]
In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as
Miami-Dade County
coroner,
[304]
declared at its completion, "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack."
[268]
More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks." One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, "could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached. ... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with
diabetes
, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and
methadone
treatments."
[305]
According to biographer Frank Coffey and Dan Warlick, one of the physicians who were present at the autopsy, Presley's death was caused by a
Valsalva maneuver
due to constipation as a result of drug abuse.
[306]
When using the toilet, "the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's
abdominal aorta
, shutting down his heart."
[307]
Later developments
Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.
[299]
Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.
[308]
The residence was declared a
National Historic Landmark
in 2006.
[309]
Presley has been inducted into five music
halls of fame
: the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
(1986), the
Country Music Hall of Fame
(1998), the
Gospel Music Hall of Fame
(2001), the
Rockabilly Hall of Fame
(2007), and the
Memphis Music Hall of Fame
(2012). In 1984, he received the
W. C. Handy Award
from the
Blues Foundation
and the
Academy of Country Music
's first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the
American Music Awards
' Award of Merit.
[310]
A
Junkie XL
remix of Presley's "
A Little Less Conversation
" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") was used in a
Nike
advertising campaign during the
2002 FIFA World Cup
. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits,
ELV1S
, which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the
Billboard
chart for the first time in almost three decades.
[311]
In 2003, a remix of "
Rubberneckin'
", a 1969 recording of Presley's, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of "That's All Right" the following year.
[312]
The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada.
[313]
In 2005, another three reissued singles, "Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung", and "It's Now or Never", went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley's previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, "All Shook Up", came with a collectors' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.
[314]
In 2005,
Forbes
magazine
named Presley the
top-earning deceased celebrity
for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45 million.
[315]
He was placed second in 2006,
[316]
returned to the top spot the next two years,
[317]
[318]
and ranked fourth in 2009.
[319]
The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever—$60 million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of
Cirque du Soleil
's
Viva Elvis
show in Las Vegas.
[320]
In November 2010,
Viva Elvis: The Album
was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks.
[321]
[322]
As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products,
[323]
and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.
[324]
Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35 million, up $8 million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley's Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.
[325]
In 2018, RCA/
Legacy
released
Elvis Presley - Where No One Stands Alone
, a new album focused on Elvis' love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and
Andy Childs
, the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It also included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.
[326]
In 2022,
Baz Luhrmann
's film
Elvis
, a biographical film about Presley's life, was released in theaters. Presley is portrayed by
Austin Butler
and Parker by
Tom Hanks
. As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind
Bohemian Rhapsody
(2018), and the
fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced
film. For his portrayal of Elvis, Butler won the
Golden Globe
and was nominated for the
Oscar for Best Actor
.
[327]
In January 2023, on what would have been Presley's 88th birthday, his
1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar
sold at an auction for $260,000. The plane sold at the Mecum Kissimmee Collector Car auction in Florida.
[328]
Artistry
Influences
Presley's earliest musical influence came from
gospel
. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them."
[329]
In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the
Ellis Auditorium
, where groups such as the
Statesmen Quartet
led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:
The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. "He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said
Jake Hess
. "The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows." Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.
[330]
As a teenager
, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,
[331]
and, as Stoller put it, "He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music."
[159]
At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know practically every religious song that's ever been written."
[150]
Musicianship
Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.
[332]
Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA albums. He played electric bass guitar on "
(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care
" after his bassist
Bill Black
had trouble with the instrument.
Presley played the bass line including the intro. Presley played piano on songs such as "
Old Shep
" and "First in Line" from his 1956 album
Elvis
.
[334]
He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as
From Elvis in Memphis
and "
Moody Blue
", and on "
Unchained Melody
", which was one of the last songs that he recorded.
[335]
Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called "
Are You Lonesome Tonight
".
[336]
In the 68 Comeback Special, Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as "
Baby What You Want Me to Do
" and "
One Night
".
[337]
Presley played the back of his guitar on some of his hits such as "
All Shook Up
", "
Don't Be Cruel
", and "
(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear
", providing percussion by slapping the instrument to create a beat.
[338]
The album
Elvis is Back!
features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as "
I Will Be Home Again
" and "
Like a Baby
".
[339]
Musical styles and genres
Presley with his longtime vocal backup group, the
Jordanaires
, March 1957
Presley was a central figure in the development of
rockabilly
, according to music historians. "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label," writes Craig Morrison.
[340]
Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as "essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction", with the defining elements as "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".
[341]
In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of
Merle Travis
-style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion".
[341]
While Katherine Charlton calls Presley "rockabilly's originator",
[342]
Carl Perkins
, another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that "[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly".
[343]
According to
Michael Campbell
, the first major rockabilly song was recorded by
Bill Haley
.
[344]
In Moore's view, "It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around
Jackson
, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old."
[345]
At RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars
[346]
and a tougher, more intense manner.
[347]
While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard "
Blue Moon
" at Sun Records to the country ballad "How's the World Treating You?" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of "Santa Claus Is Back in Town". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP
Peace in the Valley
. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.
[348]
Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.
"Run On"
From
How Great Thou Art
(1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition. The arrangement evokes "the percussive style of the 1930s
Golden Gate Quartet
."

After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".
[351]
The number five "
She's Not You
" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".
[352]
The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on
Elvis Is Back!
was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966-67 recordings as "
Down in the Alley
" and "
Hi-Heel Sneakers
".
[353]
Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song "
'O sole mio
" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".
[354]
These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.
[355]
While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the
'68 Comeback Special
, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become "hard to find".
[356]
A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and
funk
. Much of
Elvis in Memphis
, as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.
[357]
Vocal style and range
Publicity photo for the CBS program
Stage Show
, January 16, 1956
The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from "high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months."
[358]
Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the "vocal stutter" on 1955's "
Baby Let's Play House
".
[359]
When on "Don't Be Cruel", Presley "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," he shows "how masterful his relaxed style really is."
[360]
Marsh describes the vocal performance on "Can't Help Falling in Love" as one of "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing", with the line
"
'Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal".
[361]
Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".
[362]
Guralnick finds "
Stand by Me
" from the same gospel sessions "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on "Where No One Stands Alone", resorting "to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime."
[363]
Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort."
[364]
Marsh praises his 1968 reading of "
U.S. Male
", "bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records."
[365]
The performance on "In the Ghetto" is, according to Jorgensen, "devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms", instead relying on the exceptional "clarity and sensitivity of his voice".
[366]
Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of "almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity".
[367]
On "Suspicious Minds", Guralnick hears essentially the same "remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise", but supplemented with "an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)".
[368]
Music critic
Henry Pleasants
observes that "Presley has been described variously as a
baritone
and a
tenor
. An extraordinary compass ... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion."
[369]
He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two
octaves
and a third, "from the baritone low
G
to the tenor high
B
, with an upward extension in
falsetto
to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down."
[369]
In Pleasants' view, his voice was "variable and unpredictable" at the bottom, "often brilliant" at the top, with the capacity for "full-voiced high Gs and
As
that an opera baritone might envy".
[369]
Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all."
[370]
Presley was always "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.
[369]
Public image
Relationship with the African-American community
When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis'
WHBQ
, many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.
[61]
From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician
Arthur Crudup
—the originator of "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."
[45]
The Memphis World
, an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley, "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", "cracked Memphis' segregation laws" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its "colored night".
[45]
Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom.
[45]
In contrast, many white adults "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex."
[6]
Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had at some point announced, "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." A journalist with the national African American weekly
Jet
, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of
Jailhouse Rock
, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that."
[371]
Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.
[45]
[372]
Blues singer
Ivory Joe Hunter
, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest."
[373]
Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.
[374]
The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.
[372]
Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had "stolen" black music still found adherents.
[
example  needed
]
[374]
[375]
Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was
Jackie Wilson
, who argued, "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis."
[376]
Moreover, Presley also acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that]."
[377]
Nine years earlier, he had said, "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues."
[378]
Sex symbol
Poster for the film
Girls! Girls! Girls!
(1962), visualizing Presley's sex symbol image
Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", according to critic
Mark Feeney
.
[379]
Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the 1968 Comeback Special, reported, "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."
[380]
His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic
George Melly
described him as "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl".
[381]
In his Presley obituary,
Lester Bangs
credited him as "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America".
[382]
Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.
[383]
While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959,
Sight and Sound
'
s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as "aggressively bisexual in appeal".
[384]
Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the title dance sequence in
Jailhouse Rock
within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".
[385]
In the analysis of
Yvonne Tasker
, "Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display."
[386]
Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from
Natalie Wood
in the 1950s to
Connie Stevens
and
Ann-Margret
in the 1960s to
Candice Bergen
and
Cybill Shepherd
in the 1970s.
June Juanico
of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.
[227]
Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.
[387]
Equestrian
Presley kept several horses at
Graceland
, initially because of
Priscilla Presley
. "He got me my first horse as a Christmas present - Domino," said Priscilla.
[388]
The horse named Palomino Rising Sun was Presley' favorite horse, and there are many photographs of Presley riding him.

I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but ... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today. He's worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of
Frank Sinatra
—because the spiritual translucence and reined-in gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide.

[390]
Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.
[391]
As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.
[392]
With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.
[393]
In this regard,
Little Richard
said of Presley, "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music."
[394]
Al Green
agreed: "He broke the ice for all of us."
[395]
President
Jimmy Carter
remarked on Presley's legacy in 1977: "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country."
[293]
Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.
[396]

.
[398]
In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans.
[d]
American composer and conductor
Leonard Bernstein
said, "Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes. It's a whole new social revolution—the sixties came from it."
[407]
John Lennon
said that "Nothing really affected me until Elvis."
[408]
Bob Dylan
described the sensation of first hearing Presley as "like busting out of jail".
[395]
Presley's star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame
at 6777 Hollywood Blvd
For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the
American Dream
.
[409]
[410]
In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.
[411]
[412]
Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy
Southern cooking
of his upbringing, foods such as
chicken-fried steak
and
biscuits and gravy
.
[413]
[414]
In particular, his love of fried
peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches
,
[415]
[413]
now known as "Elvis sandwiches",
[416]
came to symbolize this characteristic.
[417]
According to the media scholar
Robert Thompson
, the sandwich also signified Presley's enduring all-American appeal: "He wasn't only the king, he was one of us."
[418]
Since 1977, there have been numerous
alleged sightings of Presley
. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.
[419]
[420]
Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.
[421]
An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.
[422]
Every August 16, the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland and celebrate his memory with a candlelight ritual.
[423]
"With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death", writes Ted Harrison. "He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation."
[422]
On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death,
The New York Times
asserted, "All the talentless impersonators and appalling
black velvet paintings
on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force. ... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely."
[424]
Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:
Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons. ... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great
artist
, a great
rocker
, a great
purveyor of schlock
, a great
heart throb
, a great
bore
, a great
symbol of potency
, a great
ham
, a great
nice person
, and, yes, a great American.
[425]
Achievements
Having sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the
best-selling music artists
of all time.
[426]
Presley holds the records for most songs charting in
Billboard
'
s top 40 (115)
[427]
[428]
[429]
and top 100 (152), according to chart statistician
Joel Whitburn
,
[429]
[430]
139 according to Presley historian Adam Victor.
[428]
[429]
Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided "Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel" and "Don't/I Beg of You" singles, which precede the inception of
Billboard
'
s unified
Hot 100
chart, are analyzed.
[e]
According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with
Madonna
;
[427]
per
Billboard
'
s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.
[431]
Whitburn and
Billboard
concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that
Mariah Carey
is second with 19.
[432]
Whitburn has Presley with 18:
[427]
Billboard
has him third with 17.
[433]
According to
Billboard
,  Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
[434]
[435]
with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks.
[436]
He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.
[437]
[438]
As an album artist, Presley is credited by
Billboard
with the record for the most albums charting in the
Billboard
200
: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra's 82. He also holds the record for most time spent at number one on the
Billboard
200: 67 weeks.
[439]
In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley's vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,
If I Can Dream
and
The Wonder of You
, both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybody—Presley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.
[440]
As of 2023
, the
Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5 million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and
Garth Brooks
.
[441]
He holds the records for most
gold albums
(101, nearly double second-place
Barbra Streisand
's 51),
[442]
and most platinum albums (57).
[443]
His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.
[444]
His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.
[445]
He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with
Justin Bieber
),
[446]
and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).
[447]
In 2012, the spider
Paradonea presleyi
was named in his honor.
[448]
In 2018, President
Donald Trump
awarded Presley the
Presidential Medal of Freedom
posthumously.

List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley
A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665
[428]
and 711.
[379]
His career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music. For his albums, the distinction between "official" studio records and other forms is often blurred. For most of the 1960s, his recording career focused on soundtrack albums. In the 1970s, his most heavily promoted and bestselling LP releases tended to be concert albums.

Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in
Tibet
. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as
altitude sickness
, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from
avalanches
and the
Khumbu Icefall
. As of November 2022, 310 people have
died on Everest
. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.
[5]
[6]
The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British
mountaineers
. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first
reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921
reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the
North Col
, the
1922 expedition
pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The
1924 expedition
resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day:
George Mallory
and
Andrew Irvine
made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top.
Tenzing Norgay
and
Edmund Hillary
made the
first documented ascent of Everest in 1953
, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the
1952 Swiss expedition
. The Chinese mountaineering team of
Wang Fuzhou
,
Gonpo
, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported
ascent of the peak from the north ridge
on 25 May 1960.
[7]
Name
The name "Mount Everest" was first proposed in this 1856 speech, later published in 1857, in which the mountain was first confirmed as the world's highest.
The
Tibetan
name for Everest is
Qomolangma
(
ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ
,
lit.
"Holy Mother"). The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of
Emperor Kangxi
of
Qing China
, and then appeared as
Tchoumour Lancma
on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer
D'Anville
based on the former map.
[8]
The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as
Chomolungma
and (in
Wylie
) as
Jo-mo-glang-ma
.
[13]
The official
Chinese transcription
is
珠穆朗玛峰
(
t
珠穆朗瑪峰
),
whose
pinyin
form is
Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng
. While other Chinese names were used, including
Shèngmǔ Fēng
(
t
聖母峰
,
s
圣母峰
,
lit.
"Holy Mother Peak"), these names were largely phased out when the
Ministry of Internal Affairs
of China issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952.
[14]
Other documented local names include "Deodungha" ("Holy Mountain"), but it is unclear whether it is commonly used.
[15]
In 1849, the British survey wanted to preserve local names if possible (e.g.,
Kangchenjunga
and
Dhaulagiri
), and
Andrew Waugh
, the British
Surveyor General of India
, argued that he could not find any commonly used local name, as his search for a local name was hampered by Nepal's and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor
Sir George Everest
, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.
[16]
[17]
[18]
Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the
Royal Geographical Society
in 1857 that "Everest" could not be written in
Hindi
nor pronounced by "
the native of India
". Waugh's proposed name prevailed despite the objections, and in 1865, the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest as the name for the highest mountain in the world.
[16]
[19]
The modern pronunciation of Everest (
/
ˈ
ɛ

ər

s
t
/
)
[20]
is different from Sir George's pronunciation of his surname (
/

EEV
-rist
).
[21]
[
verification needed
]
In the late 19th century, many European
cartographers
incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was
Gaurishankar
, a mountain between
Kathmandu
and Everest.
[22]
In the early 1960s, the
Nepali government
coined the
Nepali
name
Sagarmāthā
(
IAST
transcription) or
Sagar-Matha
[23]
(सगर-माथा,
[sʌɡʌrmatʰa]
,
lit.
"goddess of the sky"
[24]
),
[25]
which means "the Head in the Great Blue Sky", being derived from सगर (sagar), meaning "sky", and माथा (māthā), meaning "head".

Old Darjeeling name: "Deodungha"

[27]
Surveys
19th-century surveys
Mount Everest
relief map
In 1802, the British began the
Great Trigonometrical Survey
of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant
theodolites
, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but
Nepal
was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.
[16]
The British were forced to continue their observations from
Terai
, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and
malaria
. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.
[16]
Nonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km (150 mi) distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847,
Andrew Scott Waugh
, the British
Surveyor General of India
, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas.
Kangchenjunga
was then
considered the highest peak in the world
, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about 230 km (140 mi) away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak "b". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak "b" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but given the great distance of the observations, closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak "b", but clouds thwarted his attempts.
[16]
In 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, 190 km (120 mi) away. Nicolson then took the largest
theodolite
and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being 174 km (108 mi) from the peak.
[16]
Nicolson retreated to
Patna
on the
Ganges
to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) for peak "b", but this did not consider
light refraction
, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak "b" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on
Roman numerals
, with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak "b" now became known as Peak XV.
[16]
In 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in
Dehradun
,
Radhanath Sikdar
, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from
Bengal
was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using
trigonometric
calculations based on Nicolson's measurements.
[28]
An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in
Calcutta
. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m (28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft). Waugh concluded that Peak XV was "most probably the highest in the world".
[16]
Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.
[29]
Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being "the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest".
[30]
20th-century surveys
Published by the Survey of
Nepal
, this is Map 50 of the 57 map set at 1:50,000 scale "attached to the main text on the First Joint Inspection Survey, 1979-80,
Nepal
-China border." At the top centre, a boundary line, identified as separating "China" and "Nepal", passes through the summit contour. The boundary here and for much of the
China-Nepal border
follows the main Himalayan watershed divide.
Kangshung Face (the east face) as seen from orbit
In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the
Great Trigonometrical Survey
.
[31]
From 1952 to 1954, the
Survey of India
, using
triangulation
methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft).
[32]
In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft).
[33]
In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.
The 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China.
[34]
Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the
April 2015 Nepal earthquake
affected the height of the mountain.
[35]
In May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by
Bradford Washburn
anchored a
GPS
unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.
[36]
Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,
[37]
this figure is widely quoted.
Geoid
uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see
§ 21st-century surveys
) surveys.
[38]
In 1955, a detailed
photogrammetric
map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the
Khumbu
region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by
Erwin Schneider
as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted
Lhotse
.
In the late 1980s, an even more detailed
topographic
map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive
aerial photography
.
[39]
21st-century surveys
On 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the
Chinese Academy of Sciences
and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date.
[40]
This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),
[33]
which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.
[41]
On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).
[42]
[43]
It is thought that the
plate tectonics
of the area are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm (0.16 in) per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) per year horizontally,
[36]
[44]
but another account mentions more lateral movement (27 mm or 1.1 in),
[45]
and even shrinkage has been suggested.
[46]
Comparisons
For a more comprehensive list, see
List of highest mountains on Earth
.
The summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance
above sea level
. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the "tallest mountains on Earth".
Mauna Kea
in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;
[note 5]
it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level.
By the same measure of base to summit,
Denali
, in
Alaska
, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.
[note 5]
Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190 m (20,308 ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m (980 to 2,950 ft), yielding a height above base in the range of 5,300 to 5,900 m (17,400 to 19,400 ft); a commonly quoted figure is 5,600 m (18,400 ft).
[47]
[48]
By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m (13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the
Tibetan Plateau
, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to 15,260 ft).
[39]
The summit of
Chimborazo
in
Ecuador
is 2,168 m (7,113 ft) farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4 km, 3,967.1 mi) than that of Everest (6,382.3 km, 3,965.8 mi), because the Earth bulges at the equator.
[49]
This is despite Chimborazo having a peak 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft).
Geology
Mount Everest with snow melted, showing upper geologic layers in bands
Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called
formations
.
[50]
[51]
Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle
faults
, called
detachments
, along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the
North Col
Formation, and the
Rongbuk Formation
.
The Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation,
[52]
runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about 8,600 m (28,200 ft) above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded,
Ordovician
limestone
interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised
dolomite
with
argillaceous
laminae
and
siltstone
. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of
crinoids
in this limestone.
[53]
[54]
Later
petrographic
analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of
trilobites
, crinoids, and
ostracods
. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering
thrombolite
bed that is 60 m (200 ft) thick comprises the foot of the "
Third Step
", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about 70 m (230 ft) below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially
cyanobacteria
, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle
normal fault
, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.
[50]
[51]
[55]
The bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m (23,000 and 28,200 ft), consists of the
North Col
Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between 8,200 to 8,600 m (26,900 to 28,200 ft). The Yellow Band consists of
intercalated
beds of Middle
Cambrian
diopside
-
epidote
-bearing
marble
, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and
muscovite
-
biotite
phyllite
and
semischist
. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8,300 m (27,200 ft) found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A 5-40 cm (2.0-15.7 in) thick fault
breccia
separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.
[50]
[51]
[55]
The remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between 7,000 to 8,200 m (23,000 to 26,900 ft) on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between 7,600 and 8,200 m (24,900 and 26,900 ft), the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-
sericite
-quartz schist. Between 7,000 and 7,600 m (23,000 and 24,900 ft), the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of
quartzose
marble
. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea
flysch
composed of interbedded,
mudstone
,
shale
, clayey
sandstone
, calcareous sandstone,
graywacke
, and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the "Lhotse detachment".
[50]
[51]
[55]
Below 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of
sillimanite
-
K-feldspar
grade schist and
gneiss
intruded by numerous
sills
and
dikes
of
leucogranite
ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1,500 m (0.4 in to 4,900 ft).
[51]
[56]
These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late
Oligocene
-
Miocene
intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of
Paleoproterozoic
to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.
[57]
Mount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate
during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia
.
[58]
[59]
[60]
Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward.
[61]
[62]
The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated, metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20 kilometres (9.3 to 12.4 mi) below sea level; and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments.
[63]
The Himalayas are rising by about 5 mm per year.
IUGS geological heritage site
In respect of the recognition of the "highest rocks on the planet" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the
International Union of Geological Sciences
(IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as "a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history."
[64]
Flora and fauna
A yak at around 4,790 m (15,720 ft)
There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A type of
moss
grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species.
[65]
An alpine cushion plant called
Arenaria
is known to grow below 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region.
[66]
According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.
[67]
A minute black
jumping spider
of the genus
Euophrys
has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres (22,000 ft),
[68]
possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. Another Euophrys species,
E. everestensis
, has been found at 5,030 metres (16,500 ft), and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind.
[68]
There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.
The
bar-headed goose
migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain.
[69]
In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit.
[70]
Another bird species, the
chough
, have been spotted as high as the
South Col
at 7,920 metres (25,980 ft)
[71]
and
yellow-billed choughs
have been seen as high as 7,900 metres (26,000 ft).
[69]
Yaks
are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul around 100 kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and large lungs.
[66]
Other animals in the region include the
Himalayan tahr
, which is sometimes the prey of the
snow leopard
.
[72]
The
Himalayan black bear
can be found up to about 4,300 metres (14,000 ft) and the
red panda
is also present in the region.
[73]
One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a
pika
and ten new species of ants.
[74]
Climate
Mount Everest has an
ice cap climate
(Köppen

Climate change
The base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to
climate change
, making it unsafe for climbers. As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the director general of Nepal's tourism department—said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude. This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1. However, the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years. The move may happen by 2024, per officials.

In 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) elevation went online.
[80]
The station's first data in May 2008 were air temperature −17 °C (1 °F), relative humidity 41.3 per cent, atmospheric pressure 382.1 hPa (38.21 kPa), wind direction 262.8°, wind speed 12.8 m/s (28.6 mph, 46.1 km/h), global

[80]
The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the
Mount Everest webcam
in 2011.
[80]
[81]
The solar-powered weather station is on the
South Col
.
[82]
Mount Everest extends into the upper
troposphere
and penetrates the
stratosphere
.
[83]
The air pressure at the summit is generally about one-third what it is at sea level. The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the
jet stream
.
[84]
Winds commonly attain 160 km/h (100 mph);
[85]
in February 2004, a wind speed of 280 km/h (175 mph) was recorded at the summit.
These winds can hamper or endanger climbers, by blowing them into chasms
[85]
or (by
Bernoulli's principle
) by lowering the air pressure further, reducing available oxygen by up to 14 per cent.
[84]
[86]
To avoid the harshest winds, climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian
monsoon
season is starting up or ending.

List of people who died climbing Mount Everest
Because Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.
[87]
[88]

Overview
Everest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter.
[89]
Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987.
[89]
Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.
[90]
By March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.
[91]
Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the
jet stream
can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.
[92]
At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.
[93]
Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.
[93]
By 2013,
The Himalayan Database
recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.
[94]
Early attempts
In 1885,
Clinton Thomas Dent
, president of the
Alpine Club
, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book
Above the Snow Line
.
[95]
The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by
George Mallory
and
Guy Bullock
on the initial
1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition
. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.
The British returned for a
1922 expedition
.
George Finch
climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—290 metres (951 ft) per hour—and reached an altitude of 8,320 m (27,300 ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and
Col. Felix Norton
made a second unsuccessful attempt.
The
next expedition was in 1924
. The initial attempt by Mallory and
Geoffrey Bruce
was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the
Great Couloir
. Norton managed to reach 8,550 m (28,050 ft), though he ascended only 30 m (98 ft) or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.
[96]
1952 documentary
On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and
Andrew Irvine
made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the
Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition
found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir
Edmund Hillary
and
Tenzing Norgay
in 1953.
In 1933,
Lady Houston
, a British
millionairess
, funded the
Houston Everest Flight of 1933
, which saw a formation of two
aeroplanes
led by the
Marquess of Clydesdale
fly over the Everest
summit
.
[97]
[98]
[99]
[100]
Early expeditions—such as
Charles Bruce
's in the 1920s and
Hugh Ruttledge
's two unsuccessful attempts in
1933
and
1936
—tried to ascend the mountain from
Tibet
, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950,
Bill Tilman
and a small party which included
Charles Houston
, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an
exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal
along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.
[101]
The
1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition
, led by
Edouard Wyss-Dunant
, was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986 m (26,201 ft).
Raymond Lambert
and
Sherpa
Tenzing Norgay
were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595 m (28,199 ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.
[102]
The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.
[103]
[104]
First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953
Main article:
1953 British Mount Everest expedition
Edmund Hillary
and
Tenzing Norgay
In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by
John Hunt
, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair,
Tom Bourdillon
and
Charles Evans
, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander
Edmund Hillary
and
Tenzing Norgay
, a Nepali
Sherpa
climber. They reached the summit at 11:30
am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.
[105]
They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.
[

News of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen
Elizabeth II's
coronation
, 2 June. A few days later, the Queen gave orders that Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) were to be
knighted
in the
Order of the British Empire
for the ascent.
[106]
Tenzing, a Nepali Sherpa who was a citizen of India, was granted the
George Medal
by the UK. Hunt was ultimately made a
life peer
in Britain, while Hillary became a founding member of the
Order of New Zealand
.
[107]
Hillary and Tenzing have also been recognised in Nepal. In 2009, statues were raised in their honour, and in 2014,
Hillary Peak
and
Tenzing Peak
were named for them.

1950s-1960s
On 23 May 1956,
Ernst Schmied

and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957.
[110]
Wang Fuzhou

1970s

1970 Mount Everest disaster
In 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centrepiece was a large "siege"-style expedition led by
Saburo Matsukata
, working on finding a new route up the southwest face.
[113]
Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.
[90]
Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.
[90]
However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example,
Yuichiro Miura
became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route.
[90]
[114]
[115]
Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.
[116]
In 1975,
Junko Tabei
, a Japanese woman, became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.
[90]
The
1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition
led and organised by
Chris Bonington
made the first ascent of the south west face of Everest from the western cwm.
The
1976 British and Nepalese Army Expedition to Everest
led by
Tony Streather
put Bronco Lane and Brummy Stokes on the summit by the normal route.
In 1978,
Reinhold Messner
and
Peter Habeler
made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.
1979/1980: Winter Himalaism
Confirmation of the summit obtained by
Nepal's Ministry of Tourism
The Polish climber
Andrzej Zawada
headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on
Khumbu Glacier
in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when
Leszek Cichy
, Walenty Fiut and
Krzysztof Wielicki
set up camp IV on
South Col
(7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50
am on 17 February. At 2:40
pm
Andrzej Zawada
at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio - "We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold."
[117]
[118]
[119]
[120]
The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on
8000 metre peaks
, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of "Ice Warriors".
[121]
[118]

[123]
Lho La tragedy, 1989
In May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of
Khumbutse
near the
Lho La
pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski,
Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich
and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which
Artur Hajzer
and New Zealanders
Gary Ball
and
Rob Hall
took part. In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia
Reinhold Messner
,
Elizabeth Hawley
,
Carlos Carsolio
and the US consul.
[124]
1996 disaster
Main article:
1996 Mount Everest disaster
On 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the
2014 Mount Everest avalanche
. The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.
Journalist
Jon Krakauer
, on assignment from
Outside
magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller
Into Thin Air
, which related his experience. Krakauer was critical of guide
Anatoli Boukreev
in his recollection of the expedition.
[125]
[126]
A year later, Boukreev co-authored
The Climb
, in part as a rebuttal of Krakauer's portrayal.
[127]
The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community. Boukreev was later awarded The American Alpine Club's David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition.
[126]
In May 2004, physicist Kent Moore and surgeon John L. Semple, both researchers from the
University of Toronto
, told
New Scientist
magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent.
[128]
[129]
One of the survivors was
Beck Weathers
, an American client of New Zealand-based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness.
[130]
When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.
[131]
Weathers' condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential.
[131]
A helicopter rescue was out of the question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2. Eventually, a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali Army.
[130]
[131]
The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer
Matt Dickinson
in his book
The Other Side of Everest
. Sixteen-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account,
Within Reach: My Everest Story
.
The 2015 feature film
Everest
, directed by
Baltasar Kormákur
, is based on the events of this guiding disaster.

Small avalanche on Everest, 2006
In 2006, 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics.
[136]
The season was also remembered for the rescue of
Lincoln Hall
who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.
David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006
There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber
David Sharp
, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.
[137]
He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a "loose group", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.
[138]
It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.
[137]
Double-amputee climber
Mark Inglis
said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres (1,480 ft) below the summit, without attempting a rescue.
[139]
Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed "
Green Boots
",
[140]
but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman,
Burçak Poçan
). There has also been some discussion about
Himex
in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was "...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite - he later had five fingertips amputated." When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for US$7,490, believed to be the whole financial cost.
[141]
Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to US$100,000 plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.
[142]
It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summited Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.
[143]
On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 300 m (1,000 ft) from the summit on the North Side route.
[143]
Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. But he could not get David to stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders, and crying, Dawa had to leave him too. Even with two Sherpas, it was not going to be possible to get David down the tricky sections below.

Jamie McGuiness
[144]
Beck Weathers
of the
1996 Mount Everest disaster
said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking.
[145]
The Tribune
of Chandigarh, India
quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as "the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering".
[146]
In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.
[147]
You are never on your own. There are climbers everywhere.
—
David Sharp
[148]
Much of this controversy was captured by the
Discovery Channel
while filming the television program
Everest: Beyond the Limit
. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber, Lebanese adventurer
Maxim Chaya
, is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager (
Russell Brice
) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from
frostbite
, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.
David Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to "Green Boots"; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.
[143]
Sharp's body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC,
[149]
and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.
[6]
Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006
As the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber
Lincoln Hall
was found alive after being left for dead the day before.
[150]
He was found by a party of four climbers (
Dan Mazur
, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.
[150]
There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned.
[151]
The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family. The next day he was discovered alive by another party.
[151]
I was shocked to see a guy without gloves, hat, oxygen bottles or sleeping bag at sunrise at 28,200 feet [8,600 m] height, just sitting up there.
—
Dan Mazur
[151]
Lincoln greeted his fellow mountaineers with this:
[151]
I imagine you are surprised to see me here.
—
Lincoln Hall
[151]
Lincoln Hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from unrelated medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 (born in 1955).
[151]
2007
On 21 May 2007, Canadian climber
Meagan McGrath
initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of
Nepali
Usha Bista. Recognising this rescue, Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the
Sir Edmund Hillary
Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.
[152]
Ascent statistics up to 2010 season
Ascents of Mount Everest by year through 2010
The sun rising on Everest in 2011
By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000.
[153]
The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014.
[153]
In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253
sherpas
.
[153]
An illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the
1996 Mount Everest disaster
shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers - more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.
[153]
There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the
1922 British Mount Everest Expedition
through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5 per cent) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent.
[153]
Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.
[153]
Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005-07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for
carrying the Olympic torch
for the
2008 Summer Olympics
.
[154]
The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile.
[155]
These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.
[153]

Selfie on the summit, 2012
The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set records for numbers of summits - 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak,
[156]
and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.

2014 avalanche and season
Main article:
2014 Mount Everest avalanche
Mount Everest, 2014
On 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 at around 01:00 UTC (06:30 local time) and at an elevation of about 5,900 metres (19,400 ft).
[165]
Sixteen people were killed in the avalanche (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured.
[166]
During the season, a 13-year-old girl, Malavath Purna, reached the summit, becoming the youngest female climber to do so.
[167]
Additionally, one team used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. A team member (
Jing Wang
) donated US$30,000 to a local hospital.
[168]
She was named the Nepali "International Mountaineer of the Year".
[168]
The location of the fatal ice avalanche on the 2014 route, and the revised 2015 route through the Khumbu
Over 100 people summited Everest from China (Tibet region), and six from Nepal in the 2014 season.
[169]
This included 72-year-old Bill Burke, the Indian teenage girl, and a Chinese woman Jing Wang.
[170]
Another teen girl summiter was
Ming Kipa
Sherpa who summited with her elder sister
Lhakpa Sherpa
in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of Mount Everest at that time.

2015 avalanche, earthquake, season
Main article:
2015 Mount Everest avalanches
Everest, April 2015
2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, on 25 April 2015, an
earthquake measuring 7.8
M
w
triggered an avalanche that hit
Everest Base Camp
,
[172]
effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season.
[173]
18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team.
[174]
The avalanche began on
Pumori
,
[175]
moved through the
Khumbu Icefall
on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the
South Base Camp
.
[176]
2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.
[177]
[178]
One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the
United States Geological Survey
).
[179]
Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also
many considerable aftershocks
.
[180]
The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies.
[181]
The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers.
[181]
Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult.
[181]
The Everest tragedy was small compared to the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead
[182]
[183]
and about 22,000 injured.
[182]
In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured.
[184]
By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest.
[185]
On the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.
[186]
Mountain re-opens in August 2015
On 24 August 2015, Nepal re-opened Everest to tourism including mountain climbers.
[187]
The only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki, who had tried four times previously to summit Everest without success. He made his fifth attempt in October, but had to give up just 700 m (2,300 ft) from the summit due to "strong winds and deep snow".
[188]
[189]
Kuriki noted the dangers of climbing Everest, having himself survived being stuck in a freezing snow hole for two days near the top, which came at the cost of all his fingertips and his thumb, lost to frostbite, which added further difficulty to his climb.
[190]
Some sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (Nepal) were damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to handle trekkers.
[191]
2016 season

Hawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016.
[192]
2017 season
Main article:
Mount Everest in 2017
2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths.
[193]
On 27 May 2017,
Kami Rita
made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with
Apa Sherpa
and
Phurba Tashi Sherpa
to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times.
[194]
[195]
The season had a tragic start with the death of
Ueli Steck
of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb.
[196]
There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the
Hillary Step
.
[197]
Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648.
[163]
449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side).
[198]
2018
Main article:
Mount Everest in 2018
Mount Everest in the upper left (March 2018)
807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018,
[199]
including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side.
[156]
This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season.
[156]
[200]
[164]
Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee
Xia Boyu
, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court.
[156]
There were no major disasters, but seven climbers died in various situations including several sherpas as well as international climbers.
[156]
Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.

*Declared dead after missing
The spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers and worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world.
[206]
[207]
[208]
There were reports of various winter expeditions in the Himalayas, including K2, Nanga Parbat, and Meru with the buzz for the Everest 2019 beginning just 14 weeks to the weather window.
[209]
Noted climber Cory Richards announced on Twitter that he was hoping to establish a new climbing route to the summit in 2019.
[209]
Also announced was an expedition to re-measure the height of Everest, particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes.
[210]
[211]
China closed the base-camp to those without climbing permits in February 2019 on the northern side of Mount Everest.
[212]
By early April, climbing teams from around the world were arriving for the 2019 spring climbing season.
[164]
Among the teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution, and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region.
[213]
In the 2019 spring mountaineering season, there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side.
[214]
[215]
[216]
Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019.
[199]
For the northern routes in Chinese Tibet, several hundred more permits were issued for climbing by authorities there.
[217]
In May 2019, Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited Mount Everest twice within a week, his 23rd and 24th ascents, making international news headlines.
[218]
[214]
[215]
He first summited Everest in 1994, and has summited several other extremely high mountains, such as K2 and Lhotse.
[214]
[215]
[216]
[218]
By 23 May 2019, about seven people had died, possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain, and shorter weather windows.
[199]
One 19-year-old who summited previously noted that when the weather window opens (the high winds calm down), long lines form as everyone rushes to get the top and back down.
[219]
In Chinese Tibet, one Austrian climber died from a fall,
[199]
and by 26 May 2019 the overall number of deaths for the spring climbing season rose to 10.
[220]
[221]
[222]
By 28 May, the death toll increased to 11 when a climber died at about 7,900 m (26,000 ft) during the descent,
[204]
and a 12th climber missing and presumed dead.
[205]
Despite the number of deaths, reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season.
[223]
[157]
Although China has had various permit restrictions, and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits,
[223]
the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everest's extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll.
[223]
2020s
Both Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
. 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side.
[224]
A team of Chinese surveyors climbed Mt. Everest from the North side during April-May 2020, becoming the only climbers to summit the world's highest peak during the pandemic, at least through May. The team was there to re-measure the height of Mount Everest.
[225]
On 12 May 2022, the first all-Black team summited Mt. Everest. Seven men and two women climbers from the U.S. and Kenya, guided by eight sherpas, comprised the expedition.
[226]

Permits
In 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure.
[229]
In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017.
[230]
[229]
[
clarification needed
]
In 2017, a person who tried to climb Everest without the $11,000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall. He faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years.
[231]
The number of permits issued each year by Nepal is:
[230]
[232]
2008: 160
2009: 220
2010: 209
2011: 225
2012: 208
2013: 316
2014: 326 (extended for use through 2019)

2017: 366 to 373
2018: 346
2019: 381
2020: 0 (no permits issued during the pandemic)
2021: 408 (current record)
[233]
[234]
The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest.
[235]
They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the
Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.
[236]
In March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
.
[237]
[238]
In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side. The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers.
[239]
On 10 May 2021, a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepal's side of the mountain.
[240]
Routes
Overview South Col route and North Col/Ridge route
Mount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from
Nepal
and the north ridge from
Tibet
, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes.
[241]
Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by
Edmund Hillary
and
Tenzing Norgay
in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996.
[241]
This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China
invaded Tibet
.
[242]
Most attempts are made during May, before the summer
monsoon
season. As the monsoon season approaches, the
jet stream
shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain.
[243]
[244]
While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.
Southeast ridge
The ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to
Base Camp
at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into
Lukla
(2,860 m) from
Kathmandu
and pass through
Namche Bazaar
. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent
altitude sickness
.
[245]
Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by
yaks
,
dzopkyos
(yak-cow hybrids), and human
porters
to Base Camp on the
Khumbu Glacier
. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the
Kathmandu Valley
, as there were no roads further east at that time.
Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time,
Sherpas
and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous
Khumbu Icefall
.
Seracs
,
crevasses
, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place.
Above the icefall is Camp I at 6,065 metres (19,900 ft).
Climber traversing Khumbu Icefall
From Camp I, climbers make their way up the
Western Cwm
to the base of the
Lhotse
face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of
Nuptse
, to a small passageway known as the "Nuptse corner". The Western Cwm is also called the "Valley of Silence" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The
high altitude
and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.
[246]
From Advanced Base Camp, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on
fixed ropes
, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at 7,470 m (24,500 ft). From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the
South Col
at 7,920 m (26,000 ft).
From Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the
Geneva Spur
and the
Yellow Band
. The Geneva Spur is an anvil-shaped rib of black rock named by the
1952 Swiss expedition
. Fixed ropes assist climbers in
scrambling
over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered
marble
,
phyllite
, and
semischist
, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.
[246]
On the
South Col
, climbers enter the
death zone
. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.
From Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach "The Balcony" at 8,400 m (27,600 ft), a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious
avalanche
hazard. At 8,750 m (28,700 ft), a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the
South Summit
.
[246]
From the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge along what is known as the "Cornice traverse", where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one 2,400 m (7,900 ft) down the southwest face, while to the immediate right is the 3,050 m (10,010 ft)
Kangshung Face
. At the end of this traverse is an imposing 12 m (39 ft) rock wall, the
Hillary Step
, at 8,790 m (28,840 ft).
[247]
Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the
exposure
on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent
[
when?
]
years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.
[
citation needed
]
After the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out.
North ridge route
See also:
Three Steps
Mount Everest north face from
Rongbuk
in Tibet
The north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in
Tibet
. Expeditions trek to the
Rongbuk Glacier
, setting up base camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of
Changtse
, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft). Camp III (ABC - Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the
North Col
at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft). From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m (25,500 ft). The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m (27,000 ft). From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.
Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from 8,501 to 8,534 m (27,890 to 28,000 ft), to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from 8,577 to 8,626 m (28,140 to 28,300 ft). (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the "Chinese ladder", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers.
[248]
It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from 8,690 to 8,800 m (28,510 to 28,870 ft). Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.
[249]
Summit
A view from the summit of Mount Everest in May 2013
The summit of Everest has been described as "the size of a dining room table".
[250]
The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.
[251]
The rock summit is made of Ordovician
limestone
and is a low-grade metamorphic rock.
[252]
(see the
Surveys
section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit)
Below the summit, there is an area known as "rainbow valley", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) is an area commonly called the "death zone", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.
[83]
Below the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the
North Face
, the South-West Face, and the East/
Kangshung Face
.

Death zone
See also:
Effects of high altitude on humans
The summit of Mount Everest from the North side
From
Kala Patthar
,
Nepal
At the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the
death zone
(altitudes higher than 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in
frostbite
of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.
Another significant
threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure
. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0.333 standard atmospheres (337 mbar), resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.
[254]
Debilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres (1.07 mi) from South Col to the summit.
[255]
Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40-60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above 8,500 m (27,900 ft) without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within 2 to 3 minutes.
[256]
In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit.
[257]
Even at base camp, the low
partial pressure
of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level,
blood oxygen saturation
is generally 98 to 99 per cent. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80-90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20-30. Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe.
[258]
Lack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2015, over 200 bodies remain on the mountain. It is not uncommon to find corpses near the standard climbing routes.
[6]
Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest. Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death.
—
Mortality on Mount Everest, 1921-2006: descriptive study
[259]
A 2008 study noted that the "death zone" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit.
[260]
A 2014 article in
The Atlantic
about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.
[261]
However, Everest climbing is more deadly than
BASE jumping
, although some have combined extreme sports and Everest, including a Russian who base-jumped off Everest in a
wingsuit
(though he did survive).
[262]
Despite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period.
[263]
Some examples are
Kangchenjunga
,
K2
,
Annapurna
,
Nanga Parbat
, and the
Eiger
(especially the
nordwand
).
[263]
Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.
[264]
Another health hazard is
retinal haemorrhages
, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness.
[265]
Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.
[265]
At one o'clock in the afternoon, the British climber Peter Kinloch was on the roof of the world, in bright sunlight, taking photographs of the Himalayas below, "elated, cheery and bubbly". But Mount Everest is now his grave, because only minutes later, he suddenly went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold.

The team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections.
[266]
Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save
anyone
in such a difficult spot.
[266]
One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies.
[267]
They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to
Namche Bazaar
in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.
[267]
Supplemental oxygen

Available oxygen at Everest
Most expeditions use
oxygen masks
and
tanks
above 8,000 m (26,000 ft).
[268]
Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans' ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use
bottled oxygen
in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen.
[269]
Travelling above 2,400 m (8,000 ft) altitude is a factor in
cerebral hypoxia
.
[270]
One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.
[270]
The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the
1922 British Mount Everest Expedition
by
George Finch
and
Geoffrey Bruce
who climbed up to 7,800 m (25,600 ft) at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres (1,000 ft) per hour. Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to 8,100 m (26,600 ft) at 270 m/h (900 ft/h) - nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.
[

George Mallory
described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.
[271]
When
Tenzing
and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used
open-circuit bottled oxygen sets
, with the expedition's physiologist
Griffith Pugh
referring to the oxygen debate as a "futile controversy", noting that oxygen "greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing."
[272]
For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.
...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function.
—
Thomas F. Hornbein in
The high-altitude brain
[270]
Reinhold Messner
was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with
Peter Habeler
, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it
should
be climbed.
[24]
: 154
The aftermath of the
1996 disaster
further intensified the debate.
Jon Krakauer
's
Into Thin Air
(1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summited after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.
The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.
[273]
Guide
Anatoli Boukreev
's decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote
The Climb
) state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security.
[274]
Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.
[275]
They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams,
[275]
but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in
The Climb
, "For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and I had no problems with that."
[276]
The low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as "delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia" even after returning to lower altitudes.
[277]
In severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure.
[277]
The effects of high altitude on the brain, particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage, continue to be studied.
[277]
Autumn climbing
Everest in September 2006
Although generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the "post-monsoon season").
[66]
[278]
For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years.
[278]
The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable.
[279]
However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding.
[66]
Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973.
[280]
Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the
Los Angeles Times
.
[281]
By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest.
[282]
During the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring.
[283]
U.S. astronaut
Karl Gordon Henize
died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of
background radiation
increases with higher altitudes.
[284]
The mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days.
[285]
By January the peak is typically battered by 170 mph (270 km/h) winds and the average temperature of the summit is around −33 °F (−36 °C).

Summiting with disabilities
Summiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of
Sudarshan Gautam
, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013.
[319]
A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery.
[320]
Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the
2015 Mount Everest avalanches
. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include
Mark Inglis
(no legs),
Hari Budha Magar
(no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and
Arunima Sinha
(one leg only).
In 2001,
Erik Weihenmayer
became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest while blind.
[301]
Fake ascents
In 2021, Nepal banned three Indians for faking an ascent of Mount Everest in 2016.
[321]
[322]
In 2017, two Indian police officers, supposedly the first Indian couple to ascend Mount Everest, were sacked once it was found they had faked their ascent.
[321]
Aviation
1933: Flight over Everest

Lucy, Lady Houston
, a British

former

airplanes
led by the
Marquess of Clydesdale
flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain.
[323]
1988: First climb and glide
On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge,
Jean-Marc Boivin
made the first
paraglider
descent of Everest,
[295]
in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: "I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard."
[324]
Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes).
[324]
[325]
Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, BASE-jumping off Venezuela's
Angel Falls
.
[326]
1991: Hot air balloon flyover
In 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first
hot-air balloon
flight over Mount Everest.
[327]
In one balloon was Andy Elson and
Eric Jones
(cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and
Leo Dickinson
(cameraman).
[328]
Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called
Ballooning Over Everest
.
[328]
The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 12,000 m (40,000 ft) altitude.
[328]
Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued
Kodak
Kodachrome
film, the "best snap on Earth", according to UK newspaper
The Telegraph
.
[329]
Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger.
[327]
2005: Pilot summits with helicopter
Photo of a Eurocopter AS350 B3 "Squirrel"
In May 2005, pilot
Didier Delsalle
of France landed a
Eurocopter AS350
B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest.
[330]
He needed to land for two minutes to set the
Fédération Aéronautique Internationale
(FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice.
[330]
In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set
rotorcraft
world
records
, for highest of both landing and take-off.
[331]
Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier,
[332]
with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI.
[331]
Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4,880 m (16,000 ft) while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.
[330]
2011: Paraglide off summit
On 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to
Namche Bazaar
in 42 minutes.
[267]
[333]
After the flight they hiked, biked, and
kayaked
to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest.
[334]
They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim.
[334]
The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits.
[334]
In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program
Nightline
.
[335]
2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent
In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer
Wang Jing
used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit.
[336]
This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb.
[168]
[337]
Nepal ended up investigating
Wang
, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.
[338]
In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. "If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home", she said in an interview. In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.
[168]
Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal's interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.
[168]
National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town's hospital. Wang won the
International Mountaineer of the Year Award
from the Nepal government in June 2014.
[336]
2016: Helicopter business increases
In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall.
[339]
In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.
[339]
After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though).
[339]
That summer Bell tested the
412EPI
, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as 6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest.
[340]
Commercial climbing
Top down view showing the location of the summit, and its three main faces/sides
Everest Base Camp
Gorak Shep
is about a three-hour walk to South EBC (Everest Base Camp).
[341]
According to
Jon Krakauer
, the era of
commercialisation
of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by
David Breashears
that included
Richard Bass
, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with only four years of climbing experience.
[342]
By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain.
Rob Hall
, one of the mountaineers who died in the
1996 disaster
, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.
[24]
: 24, 42
By 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000 and US$200,000.
[343]
Going with a "celebrity guide", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015.
[344]
However, the services offered vary widely and it is "buyer beware" when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
[343]
[345]
Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the
gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2019
[346]
in a country with high unemployment,
[347]
but Everest is special in that an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.
[348]
Costs beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are "budget" travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007.
[141]
However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of
David Sharp
).
Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use
bottled oxygen
, which adds around US$3,000.
[349]
The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team.
[349]
The ascent typically starts at one of the
two base camps
near the mountain, both of which are approximately 100 kilometres (60 mi) from
Kathmandu
and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from
Lhasa
(the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.
[349]
Many climbers hire "full service" guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including the acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents,
fixed ropes
,
[350]
medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000 to $80,000 per person.
[351]
Since most equipment is moved by
Sherpas
, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms (22 lb), or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like
Denali
, are often expected to carry backpacks over 30 kilograms (66 lb) and, occasionally, to tow a
sled
with 35 kilograms (77 lb) of gear and food.
[352]
The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.
[158]
Jamling Tenzing Norgay
, the son of
Tenzing Norgay
, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, "You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on
crampons
. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others."
[353]
One example of this is
Shriya Shah-Klorfine
, who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012.
[354]
She paid at least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight.
[355]
Reinhold Messner
concurred in 2004, "You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks."
[356]
By 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience, hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue.
[357]
One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money
not
taking inexperienced climbers to the summit.
[343]
Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price—that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.
[343]
Whereas a Western firm will convince those they deem incapable to turn back, other firms simply give people the freedom to choose.
[343]
However, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative. For example,
Edmund Hillary
stated in 2003 that while "Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all",
[358]
he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, "I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them."
[359]
One of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of
Seven Summits
fame) stated in 2003 that "Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot [6,100 m] mountain and 29,000-foot [8,800 m]. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [6,190 m or 20,320 ft] or Aconcagua [6,960 m or 22,834 ft] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that."
[360]
Thefts and crime
Some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. In May 2006,
Vitor Negrete
, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.
[361]
[362]
"Several members were bullied, gear was stolen, and threats were made against me and my climbing partner, Michael Kodas, making an already stressful situation even more dire", said one climber.
[363]
In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book,
High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed
(2008):
[364]
unethical guides and Sherpas,
prostitution
and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.
[365]
[366]
The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as "out of control" in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa.
[367]
Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft.
[367]
In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.
[368]
2014 Sherpa strike
On 18 April 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the Everest climbing community up to that time, 16 Sherpas died in Nepal due to the
avalanche that swept them off Mount Everest
. In response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss.
[369]
[370]
Some still wanted to climb but there was too much controversy to continue that year.
[369]
One of the issues that triggered the work action by Sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.
[369]
Extreme sports at Mount Everest
Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.
Yuichiro Miura
became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries.
[90]
Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.
[371]
Other Everest skiers include
Davo Karničar
of Slovenia, who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000,
Hans Kammerlander
of Italy in 1996 on the north side,
[372]
and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006.
[373]
In 2006 Swede
Tomas Olsson
and Norwegian
Tormod Granheim
skied together down the north face. Olsson's anchor broke while they were
rappelling
down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim skied down to camp III.
[374]
Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.
[371]
Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986
Steve McKinney
led an expedition to Mount Everest,
[375]
during which he became the first person to fly a
hang-glider
off the mountain.
[325]
Frenchman
Jean-Marc Boivin
made the first
paraglider
descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp.
[295]
In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) in 45 minutes.
[376]
On 5 May 2013, the beverage company
Red Bull
sponsored
Valery Rozov
, who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a
wingsuit
, setting a record for world's highest BASE jump in the process.
[262]
[377]
Everest and religion
The
Rongphu Monastery
, with Mount Everest in the background
The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several "hidden valleys" of refuge designated by
Padmasambhava
, a ninth-century "
lotus-born
" Buddhist saint.
[378]
Near the base of the north side of Everest lies
Rongbuk Monastery
, which has been called the "sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world."
[379]
For
Sherpas
living on the slopes of Everest in the
Khumbu
region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through
Nangpa La
.
[105]
Miyolangsangma
, a
Tibetan
Buddhist
"
Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving
", is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.
[378]
The
Sherpa people
also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the
karmic
effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.
[378]
Waste management
Further information:
Impacts of tourism § Mount Everest
In 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as 12,000 kg (26,500 lb) of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain.
[380]
Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 5,500 m (18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190-litre (50-US-gallon) barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.
[381]
The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.
[382]
In February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the
Rongbuk Monastery
.
[383]
In April 2019, the
Solukhumbu district
's
Khumbu Pasanglhamu
Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000 kg of garbage from Everest.

Captain America
is a
superhero
created by
Joe Simon
and
Jack Kirby
who appears in
American comic books
published by
Marvel Comics
. The character first appeared in
Captain America Comics
#1, published on December 20, 1940 by
Timely Comics
, a corporate predecessor to Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is
Steve Rogers
, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an experimental "
super-soldier
serum" after joining the
United States Army
to aid the country's efforts in
World War II
. Equipped with an
American flag
-inspired costume and
a virtually indestructible shield
, Captain America and his
sidekick
Bucky Barnes
clashed frequently with the villainous
Red Skull
and other members of the
Axis powers
. In the final days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a state of
suspended animation
until he was revived in modern times. He resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the superhero team the
Avengers
, but frequently struggles as a "man out of time" to adjust to the new era.
The character quickly emerged as Timely's most popular and commercially successful wartime creation upon his original publication, though the popularity of superheroes declined in the post-war period and
Captain America Comics
was discontinued in 1950. The character saw a short-lived revival in 1953 before returning to comics in 1964, and has since remained in continuous publication. Captain America's creation as an explicitly
anti-Nazi
figure was a deliberately political undertaking: Simon and Kirby were stridently opposed to the actions of
Nazi Germany
and supporters of U.S. intervention in World War II, with Simon conceiving of the character specifically in response to the American
non-interventionism movement
. Political messages have subsequently remained a defining feature of Captain America stories, with writers regularly using the character to comment on the state of American society and government.
Having appeared in more than ten thousand stories in more than five thousand media formats, Captain America is one of the most popular and recognized
Marvel Comics characters
, and has been described as an icon of
American popular culture
. Though Captain America was not the first
United States-themed superhero
, he would become the most popular and enduring of the many patriotic American superheroes created during World War II. Captain America was the first Marvel character to appear in a medium outside of comic books, in the 1944
serial film
Captain America
; the character has subsequently appeared
in a variety of films
and
other media
, including the
Marvel Cinematic Universe
, where he was portrayed by actor
Chris Evans
from the character's first appearance in
Captain America: The First Avenger
(2011) to his final appearance in
Avengers: Endgame
(2019).

List of Captain America titles
Creation and development
"It was a time of deep passion. Hitler was grabbing all of Europe, we had Nazis in America, Nazis holding
mass meetings in Madison Square Garden
. [...] Captain America was created in that atmosphere, he was a natural outgrowth of the passionate mood of the country."
-
Jack Kirby
[1]
In 1940,
Timely Comics
publisher
Martin Goodman
responded to the growing popularity of
superhero comics
- particularly
Superman
at rival publisher
National Comics Publications
, the corporate predecessor to
DC Comics
- by hiring freelancer
Joe Simon
to create a new superhero for the company.
[2]
Simon began to develop the character by determining who their nemesis could be, noting that the most successful superheroes were defined by their relationship with a compelling villain, and eventually settled on
Adolf Hitler
.
[3]
[4]
He rationalized that Hitler was the "best villain of them all" as he was "hated by everyone in the free world",
[4]
and that it would be a unique approach for a superhero to face a real-life adversary rather than a fictional one.
[3]
[c]
This approach was also intentionally political. Simon was stridently opposed to the actions of
Nazi Germany
and supported U.S. intervention in
World War II
, and intended the hero to be a response to the American
non-interventionism movement
.
[5]
Simon initially considered "Super American" for the hero's name, but felt there were already multiple comic book characters with "super" in their names.
[6]
He worked out the details of the character, who was eventually named "Captain America", after he completed sketches in consultation with Goodman.
[2]
The hero's civilian name "Steve Rogers" was derived from the telegraphy term "
roger
", meaning "message received".
[2]
Goodman elected to launch Captain America with his own self-titled comic book, making him the first Timely character to debut with his own
ongoing series
without having first appeared in an
anthology
.
[4]
Simon sought to have
Jack Kirby
be the primary artist on the series: the two developed a working relationship and friendship in the late 1930s after working together at
Fox Feature Syndicate
, and had previously developed characters for Timely together.
[7]
[8]
Kirby also shared Simon's pro-intervention views, and was particularly drawn to the character in this regard.
[4]
Goodman, conversely, wanted a team of artists on the series. It was ultimately determined that Kirby would serve as
penciller
, with
Al Avison
and
Al Gabriele
assisting as
inkers
;
[4]
Simon additionally negotiated for himself and Kirby to receive 25 percent of the profits from the comic.
[9]
Simon regards Kirby as a co-creator of Captain America, stating that "if Kirby hadn't drawn it, it might not have been much of anything."
[4]
Debut and early success (early 1940s)
Main article:
Captain America Comics
Cover of
Captain America Comics
#1 (December 1940,
cover dated
March 1941). Art by
Joe Simon
and
Jack Kirby
.
Captain America Comics
#1 was published on December 20, 1940,
[10]
with a
cover date
of March 1941.
[11]
While the front cover of the issue featured Captain America punching Hitler, the comic itself established the
Red Skull
as Captain America's primary adversary, and also introduced
Bucky Barnes
as Captain America's teenaged
sidekick
.
[12]
Simon stated that he personally regarded Captain America's
origin story
, in which the frail Steve Rogers becomes a
supersoldier
after receiving an experimental serum, as "the weakest part of the character", and that he and Kirby "didn't put too much thought into the origin. We just wanted to get to the action."
[4]
Kirby designed the series' action scenes with an emphasis on a sense of continuity across panels, saying that he "choreographed" the sequences as one would a ballet, with a focus on exaggerated character movement. Kirby's layouts in
Captain America Comics
are characterized by their distorted perspectives, irregularly shaped panels, and the heavy use of
speed lines
.
[13]
The first issue of
Captain America Comics
sold out in a matter of days, and the second issue's print run was set at over one million copies.
[14]
[15]
Captain America quickly became Timely's most popular character, with the publisher creating an official Captain America
fan club
called the "Sentinels of Liberty".
[5]
[d]
Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as
Time
during the same period.
[17]
Captain America Comics
was additionally one of 189 periodicals that the
US Department of War
deemed appropriate to distribute to its soldiers without prior screening.
[18]
The character would also make appearances in several of Timely's other comic titles, including
All Winners Comics
,
Marvel Mystery Comics
,
U.S.A. Comics
, and
All Select Comics
.
[19]
Though Captain America was not the first
United States-themed superhero
- a distinction that belongs to
The Shield
at
MLJ Comics
[20]
- he would become the most popular patriotic American superhero of those created during World War II.
[21]
Captain America's popularity drew a complaint from MLJ that the character's triangular heater shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of The Shield. This prompted Goodman to direct Simon and Kirby to change the design beginning with
Captain America Comics
#2. The revised round shield went on to become an iconic element of the character;
[20]
its use as a
discus
-like throwing weapon originated in a short prose story in
Captain America Comics
#3, written by
Stan Lee
in his professional debut as a writer.
[22]
[23]
Timely's publication of
Captain America Comics
led the company to be targeted with threatening letters and phone calls from the
German American Bund
, an American Nazi organization. When members began loitering on the streets outside the company's office, police protection was posted and New York mayor
Fiorello La Guardia
personally contacted Simon and Kirby to guarantee the safety of the publisher's employees.
[24]
Simon wrote the first two issues of
Captain America Comics
before becoming the editor for the series; they were the only Captain America stories he would ever directly write.
[25]
While Captain America generated acclaim and industry fame for Simon and Kirby, the pair believed that Goodman was withholding the promised percentage of profits for the series, prompting Simon to seek employment for himself and Kirby at National Comics Publications.
[9]
When Goodman learned of Simon and Kirby's intentions, he effectively fired them from Timely Comics, telling them they were to leave the company after they completed work on
Captain America Comics
#10.
[26]
The authorship of
Captain America Comics
was subsequently assumed by a variety of individuals, including
Otto Binder
,
Bill Finger
, and
Manly Wade Wellman
as writers, and Al Avison,
Vince Alascia
, and
Syd Shores
as pencilers.
[16]
Decline in popularity (mid-1940s and 1950s)
Superhero comics began to decline in popularity in the post-war period.
[27]
This prompted a variety of attempts to reposition Captain America, including having the character fight gangsters rather than wartime enemies in
Captain America Comics
#42 (October 1944), appearing as a high school teacher in
Captain America Comics
#59 (August 1946), and joining Timely's first superhero team, the
All-Winners Squad
, in
All Winners Comics
#19 (Fall 1946).
[16]
The series nevertheless continued to face dwindling sales, and
Captain America Comics
ended with its 75th issue in February 1950.
[16]
Horror comics
were ascendant as a popular comic genre during this period; in keeping with the trend, the final two issues of
Captain America Comics
were published under the title
Captain America's Weird Tales
.
[16]
Timely's corporate successor
Atlas Comics
relaunched the character in 1953 in
Young Men
#24, where Captain America appears alongside the wartime heroes
Human Torch
and
Toro
, which was followed by a revival of
Captain America Comics
in 1954 written by Stan Lee and drawn by
John Romita
.
[28]
In the spirit of the
Cold War
and
McCarthyism
, the character was billed as "Captain America, Commie Smasher" and faced enemies associated with the
Soviet Union
.
[29]
The series was a commercial failure, and was cancelled after just three issues.
[29]
Romita attributed the series' failure to the changing political climate, particularly the public opposition to the
Korean War
; the character subsequently fell out of active publication for nearly a decade, with Romita noting that "for a while, 'Captain America' was a dirty word".
[30]
Return to comics (1960s)
Cover of
The Avengers
#4 (March 1964). Art by Jack Kirby and
George Roussos
.
Captain America made his ostensible return in the anthology
Strange Tales
#114 (November 1963), published by Atlas' corporate successor
Marvel Comics
. In an 18-page story written by Lee and illustrated by Kirby,
[e]
Captain America reemerges following years of apparent retirement, though he is revealed as an impostor who is defeated by
Johnny Storm
of the
Fantastic Four
. A caption in the final panel indicates that the story was a "test" to gauge interest in a potential return for Captain America;
[32]
the reader response to the story was enthusiastic,
[33]
and the character was formally reintroduced in
The Avengers
#4 (March 1964).
[34]
The Avengers
#4
retroactively established
that Captain America had fallen into the
Atlantic Ocean
in the final days of World War II, where he spent decades frozen in ice in a state of
suspended animation
before being found and recovered.
[34]
[f]
Captain America solo stories written by Lee with Kirby as the primary penciller were published in the anthology
Tales of Suspense
alongside solo stories focused on fellow Avengers member
Iron Man
beginning in November 1964; the character also appeared in Lee and Kirby's World War II-set
Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos
beginning in December same year. These runs introduced and retroactively established several new companions of Captain America, including
Nick Fury
,
Peggy Carter
, and
Sharon Carter
.
[36]
In 1966, Joe Simon sued Marvel Comics, asserting that he was legally entitled to
renew the copyright
on the character upon the expiration of the original 28-year term. The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and was therefore
work for hire
owned by the company.
[37]
Captain America's
self-titled ongoing series
was relaunched in April 1968, with Lee as writer and Kirby as penciller; Kirby later departed the series, and was replaced by
Gene Colan
.
[38]
In 1969, writer and artist
Jim Steranko
authored a three-issue run of
Captain America
. Despite the brevity of Steranko's time on the series, his contributions significantly influenced how Captain America was represented in post-war comics, reestablishing the character's
secret identity
and positioning the character as deeply conflicted by the tension between America
as it idealizes itself to be
and America in reality - a theme that would recur frequently in
Captain America
comics in the subsequent decades.
[39]
[40]
Political shifts (1970s)
"This was the '70s - prime
anti-war years
- and here was a guy with a flag on his chest who was supposed to represent what most people distrusted. No one knew what to do with him."
-
Steve Englehart
[41]
In contrast to the character's enthusiastic participation in World War II, comics featuring Captain America rarely broached the topic of the
Vietnam War
,
[42]
though the subject of Captain America's potential participation was frequently debated by readers in the letters to the editor section in
Captain America
.
[43]
Marvel maintained a position of neutrality on Vietnam; in 1971, Stan Lee wrote in an editorial that a poll indicated that a majority of readers did not want Captain America to be involved in Vietnam, adding that he believed the character "simply doesn't lend himself to the
John Wayne
-type character he once was" and that he could not "see any of our characters taking on a role of super-patriotism in the world as it is today".
[43]
Captain America stories in the 1970s began to increasingly focus on domestic American political issues, such as poverty, racism, pollution, and political corruption.
[44]
[g]
Captain America
#117 (September 1969) introduced
The Falcon
as the first African-American superhero in mainstream comic books
[46]
and who would become Captain America's partner; the series was cover titled as
Captain America and the Falcon
beginning February 1971, which it would maintain for the next seven and a half years.
[47]
These political shifts were significantly shaped by comics created by writer
Steve Englehart
and artist
Sal Buscema
, who joined the series in 1972.
[48]
[41]
In a 1973 storyline written by Englehart directly inspired by the
Watergate scandal
, Captain America is framed for murder by the fascistic
Secret Empire
, whose leader is ultimately revealed to be the president of the United States.
[49]
The incident causes a disillusioned Steve Rogers to briefly drop the moniker of Captain America to become "
Nomad
, the man without a country", though he later vowed to "reclaim the ideals of America, which its leaders have trampled upon" and again assumed the role of Captain America.
[44]
Englehart and Buscema's run was highly acclaimed, bringing
Captain America
from one of Marvel's lowest-selling titles to its top-selling comic.
[48]
[41]
In 1975,
Roy Thomas
created the comic book series
The Invaders
. Set during World War II, the comic focuses on a superhero team composed of Timely's wartime-era superheroes, with Captain America as its leader; Thomas, a fan of stories from the
Golden Age of Comic Books
, drew inspiration for the series from Timely's All-Winners Squad.
[50]
Jack Kirby wrote and illustrated run on
Captain America and the Falcon
from 1975 to 1977.
[51]
This was followed by issues authored by a number of writers and artists, including Roy Thomas,
Donald F. Glut
,
Roger McKenzie
, and Sal Buscema; the series was also re-titled
Captain America
beginning with issue 223 in 1978.
[52]
Post-Vietnam and "Heroes Reborn" (1980s and 1990s)
Owing to the series' lack of a regular writer,
Captain America
editor
Roger Stern
and artist
John Byrne
authored the series from 1980 to 1981. Their run that saw a storyline in which Captain America declines an offer to run for president of the United States.
[53]
[54]
Following Stern and Byrne,
Captain America
was authored by writer
J.M. Dematteis
and artist
Mike Zeck
from 1981 to 1984.
[55]
Their run featured a year-long storyline in which Captain America faced a crisis of confidence in the face of what Dematteis described as "
Reagan
Cold War
rhetoric".
[55]
The story was originally planned culminate in
Captain America
#300 with Captain America renunciating violence to become a
pacifist
; when that ending was rejected by Marvel editor-in-chief
Jim Shooter
, Dematteis resigned from
Captain America
in protest.
[56]
Writer
Mark Gruenwald
, editor of
Captain America
from 1982 to 1985, served as writer on the series from 1985 to 1995. Various artists illustrated the series over the course of Gruenwald's decade-long run, including
Paul Neary
from 1985 to 1987, and
Kieron Dwyer
from 1988 to 1990.
[55]
In contrast to DeMatteis, Gruenwald placed less emphasis on Steve Rogers' life as a civilian, wishing to show "that Steve Rogers is Captain America first [...] he has no greater needs than being Captain America."
[57]
Among the most significant storylines appearing in Gruenwald's run was "
The Choice
" in 1987, in which Steve Rogers renounces the identity of Captain America to briefly become simply "The Captain" after the United States government orders him to continue his superheroic activities directly under their control.
[58]
After Gruenwald departed the series, writer
Mark Waid
and artist
Ron Garney
began to author
Captain America
in 1995. Despite early acclaim, including the reintroduction of Captain America's love interest Sharon Carter, their run was terminated after ten issues as a result of Marvel's "
Heroes Reborn
" rebranding in 1996.
[59]
The rebrand saw artists
Jim Lee
and
Rob Liefeld
, who had left the company in the early 1990s to establish
Image Comics
, return to Marvel to re-imagine several of the company's characters.
[60]
Marvel faced various financial difficulties in the 1990s, culminating in the company filing for
Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in 1996,
[61]
and "Heroes Reborn" was introduced as part of an effort to increase sales.
[62]
As part of the rebrand, Liefeld illustrated and co-wrote with
Jeph Loeb
a run on
Captain America
that was ultimately cancelled after six issues.
[62]
Marvel stated that the series was cancelled due to low sales,
[62]
though Liefeld has contended that he was fired after he refused to take a lower pay rate amid Marvel's bankruptcy proceedings.
[63]
Waid would return to
Captain America
in 1998, initially with Garney as arist and later with
Andy Kubert
.
[59]
In 1999, Joe Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the
Copyright Act of 1976
that allows the original creators of works that have been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term has expired. Marvel challenged the claim, arguing that Simon's 1966 settlement made the character ineligible for copyright transfer. Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing of the character.

Modern era (2000s to present)
Writer and artist
Dan Jurgens
took over
Captain America
from Waid in 2000, positioning the character in a world he described as "more cynical [...] in terms of how we view our government, our politicians and people's motives in general".
[65]
In the wake of the
September 11 attacks
, a new
Captain America
series written by
John Ney Rieber
with artwork by
John Cassady
was published under the
Marvel Knights
imprint from 2002 to 2003.
[66]
The series received criticism for its depiction of Captain America fighting terrorists modelled after
Al-Qaeda
, though Cassady contended that the aim of the series was to depict "the emotions this hero was going through" in the wake of 9/11, and the "guilt and anger a man in his position would feel".
[67]
In 2005, Marvel relaunched
Captain America
in
a new volume
written by
Ed Brubaker
and illustrated by
Steve Epting
. The run reintroduced Captain America's
previously deceased
partner Bucky Barnes as the Winter Soldier, a brainwashed cybernetic assassin.
[68]
Contemporaneously, Captain America was a central character in the 2006
crossover storyline
"
Civil War
", written by
Mark Millar
and penciled by
Steve McNiven
, which saw the character come into conflict with fellow Avengers member Iron Man over government efforts to regulate superheroes.
[69]
The character was killed in the 2007 storyline "
The Death of Captain America
" written by Brubaker,
[68]
which was accompanied by the miniseries
Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America
written by Jeph Loeb;
[70]
the character was later revived in the 2009 limited series
Captain America: Reborn
.
[71]
Brubaker's run on
Captain America
, which ran across various titles until 2012, was critically and commercially acclaimed;
Captain America
#25 (which contains the character's death) was the best-selling comic of 2007,
[72]
and Brubaker won the
Harvey Award
for Best Writer for the series in 2006.
[73]
After Brubaker's run on
Captain America
ended in 2012, a new volume of the series written by
Rick Remender
was published as part of the
Marvel Now
rebranding initiative, which saw Sam Wilson assume the mantle of Captain America in 2014.
[74]
This was followed by a run written by
Nick Spencer
beginning in 2016, in which Captain America was replaced by a version of himself later known as "Hydra Supreme", loyal to the villainous organization
Hydra
, culminating in the 2017 crossover event
Secret Empire
.
[75]
As part of Marvel's
Fresh Start
rebrand in 2018, a new
Captain America
series written by
Ta-Nehisi Coates
with art by
Leinil Francis Yu
was published from 2018 to 2021.
[76]
[77]
A new volume of
Captain America
written by
J. Michael Straczynski
began publication in September 2023.

List of Captain America titles
As of 2015
, Captain America has appeared in more than ten thousand stories in more than five thousand media formats, including comic books, books, and trade publications.
[79]
The character's
origin story
has been retold and revised multiple times throughout his editorial history, though its broad details have remained generally consistent.
[80]
Steven "Steve" Rogers was born in the 1920s to an impoverished family on the
Lower East Side
of
New York City
. The frail and infirm Rogers attempts to join the
U.S. Army
in order to fight in the
Second World War
, but is rejected after being deemed unfit for military service.
[81]
His resolve is nevertheless noticed by the military, and he is recruited as the first test subject for "Project Rebirth", a secret government program that seeks to create
super soldiers
through the development of the "Super-Soldier Serum". Though the serum successfully enhances Rogers to the peak to human physical perfection, a Nazi spy posing as a military observer destroys the remaining supply of the serum and assassinates
its inventor
, foiling plans to produce additional super soldiers. Rogers is given a patriotic uniform and
shield
by the American government and becomes the costumed superhero Captain America. He goes on to fight the villainous
Red Skull
and other members of the
Axis powers
both domestically and abroad, alongside his sidekick
Bucky Barnes
and as a member of the
Invaders
. In the final days of the war, Rogers and Barnes seemingly perish after falling from an experimental
drone plane
into the northern
Atlantic Ocean
.
[58]
Rogers is found decades later by the superhero team the
Avengers
, the Super-Soldier Serum having allowed him to survive frozen in a block of ice in a state of
suspended animation
.
[58]
Reawakened in modern times, Rogers resumes activities as a costumed hero, joining and later becoming leader of the Avengers.
[82]
Many of his exploits involve missions undertaken for the Avengers or for
S.H.I.E.L.D.
, an espionage and international law enforcement agency operated by his former war comrade
Nick Fury
. Through Fury, Rogers befriends
Sharon Carter
, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent with whom he eventually begins a partnership and an on-again off-again romance. He meets and trains
Sam Wilson
, who becomes the superhero Falcon, and they establish an enduring friendship and partnership.
[83]
After a conspiracy hatched by the
Secret Empire
to discredit Rogers is revealed to have been personally orchestrated by the President of the United States, a disillusioned Rogers abandons the mantle of Captain America and assumes the title of "
Nomad
", the "man without a country".
[84]
He eventually re-assumes the title, and later declines an offer from the "New Populist Party" to run for president himself.
[84]
He again abandons the mantle of Captain America to briefly assume the alias of "
The Captain
" when a
government commission
orders him to work directly for the U.S. government.
[85]
In the aftermath of the
September 11 attacks
, Rogers reveals his secret identity to the world.
[84]
Following the
disbandment of the Avengers
, he discovers that
Bucky is still alive
, having been brainwashed by the Soviets to become the Winter Soldier.
[86]
Later, in reaction to
government efforts to regulate superheroes
, Rogers becomes the leader of an underground anti-registration movement that clashes with a pro-registration faction led by fellow Avengers member
Iron Man
.
[87]
After significant rancor, he voluntarily surrenders and submits to arrest. At his trial, he is
shot and killed
by Sharon Carter, whose actions are manipulated by the villainous
Dr. Faustus
; in his absence, a recovered Bucky assumes the title of Captain America.
[88]
It is eventually revealed that
Rogers did not die
, but became displaced in space and time; he is ultimately able to return to the present.
[89]
He resumes his exploits as a superhero, though his public identity is briefly
supplanted by a sleeper agent
from the terrorist organization
Hydra
.
[90]
Personality and motivations
"Rogers' transformation into Captain America is underwritten by the military. But, perhaps haunted by his own roots in powerlessness, he is a dissident just as likely to be feuding with his superiors in civilian and military governance as he is to be fighting with the supervillain Red Skull. [...] He is 'a man out of time,' a walking emblem of
greatest-generation
propaganda brought to life in this splintered postmodern time."
-
Ta-Nehisi Coates
[91]
Steve Rogers' personality has shifted across his editorial history, a fact that media scholar J. Richard Stevens sees as a natural consequence of the character being written and re-interpreted by many writers over the span of multiple decades. However, Stevens identifies two aspects of the character's personality that have remained consistent across expressions: his "uncompromising purity" and "his ability to judge the character in others".
[92]
Early Captain America stories typically paid little attention to Rogers' civilian identity; in his 1970 book
The Steranko History of Comics
, Jim Steranko notes that the character was often criticized for being two-dimensional as a result. He argues that this was an intentional device, writing that these critics "failed to grasp the true implication of his being. Steve Rogers never existed, except perhaps as an abstract device for the convenience of storytelling. Captain America was not an embodiment of human characteristics but a pure idea."
[93]
Following the character's return to comics in the 1960s, many stories gave increased focus to Rogers' civilian identity, particularly his struggles as a "man out of time" attempting to adjust to the modern era.
[94]
Often, stories depict a brooding or melancholic Rogers as he faces both a physical struggle as Captain America, and an ideological struggle as Steve Rogers to reconcile his social values with modern times.
[95]
The character is frequently conflicted by  his World War II-era "good war" morality being challenged and made anachronistic by the compromising demands of the post-war era.
[95]
[96]
Prior to Bucky Barnes' return to comics in the 2000s, many Captain America stories centered on Rogers' sense of guilt over Barnes' death. Culture scholar Robert G. Weiner argues that these stories mirror the
post-traumatic stress disorder
and
survivor guilt
held by many war veterans, and that this trauma distinguishes the character from other well-known superheroes such as
Batman
and
Spider-Man
: while those characters became heroes because of a traumatic incident, Rogers carries on as a hero in spite of a traumatic incident, with Weiner asserting that this reinforces the nobility of the character.
[97]
Political themes
Though Marvel has historically trended away from making overt partisan statements in the post-war period, writers have nevertheless used Captain America to comment on the state of American society and government at particular moments in history.
[83]
For example, the conspiracy storyline of "Secret Empire" reflected what writer Steve Englehart saw as broad disillusionment with American institutions in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal,
[84]
the "Streets of Poison" storyline by Mark Gruenwald in the 1990s was intended to address anxieties around the
drug trade
and debates on the
war on drugs
,
[84]
and "Civil War" by Mark Millar was widely interpreted as an allegory for the
Patriot Act
and post-9/11 debates on the balance between national security and civil liberties.
[98]
While the ideological orientation of Captain America stories has shifted in response to changing social and political attitudes, Stevens notes how a central component of Captain America's mythology is that the character himself does not change: when the character's attitudes have shifted, it is consistently framed as an evolution or a new understanding of his previously-held ideals. Stevens argues that the character's seeming paradoxical steadfastness is reflective of "the language of comics, where continuity is continually updated to fit the needs of the serialized present."
[99]
Despite his status as patriotic superhero, Captain America is rarely depicted as an overly
jingoistic
figure. Stevens writes that the character's "patriotism is more focused on the universal rights of man as expressed through the
American Dream
" rather than "a position championing the specific cultural or political goals of the United States."
[100]
Weiner similarly concurs that the character "embodies what America strives to be, not what it sometimes is".
[101]
Dittmer agrees that while the character sees himself "as the living embodiment of the American Dream (rather than a tool of the state)",
[102]
his status as a patriotic superhero nevertheless tethers him to American foreign policy and hegemony.
[103]
He argues that Captain America tends to skew away from interventionist actions at moments where the United States is undertaking policies that its critics deem imperialist, specifically citing the character's non-participation in the Vietnam and Iraq wars,
[104]
and argues that the character's inconsistent position on the use of deadly force across his editorial history "is perhaps a tacit acknowledgment of the violence, or the threat of violence, at the heart of American hegemony."
[105]
Powers, abilities, and equipment
See also:
Captain America's shield
"Cap is one of the hardest hero characters to write, because the writer cannot use some exotic super-power to make his episodes seem colorful. [...] All he has to serve him are his extraordinary combat skills, his shield, and his unquenchable love for freedom and justice."
-
Stan Lee
[106]
Captain America possesses no
superpowers
, though the Super-Soldier Serum has enhanced his body's strength, speed, agility, endurance, reflexes, reaction time, and natural
self-healing
ability to the peak of human physical perfection. He is additionally an expert tactician and field commander, and has achieved mastery in a variety of hand-to-hand combat styles, including
boxing
and
judo
.
[107]
The precise parameters of Captain America's physical prowess vary across stories due to editorial dictates and artistic license taken by authors; Steve Englehart was given an editorial order to give the character
superhuman strength
in the 1970s, but the change did not remain permanent and was soon forgotten.
[41]
Steve Rogers is also a skilled visual artist, having worked as a commercial illustrator prior to joining the military, and several storylines have depicted the character working as a freelance artist.
[108]
The basic design of Captain America's costume has remained largely consistent from its original incarnation in the 1940s. Designed by Joe Simon, the costume is based on the
United States flag
, with Simon likening the character's appearance to that of "a modern-day crusader": chain mail armor, and  a helmet adorned with wings in reference to the Roman god
Mercury
.
[109]
Steve Rogers has worn other costumes when he has adopted alternate superhero alter egos: as Nomad he wears a
domino mask
and a black and gold suit that is cut to expose his bare chest and stomach,
[110]
and as The Captain he wears a modified version of the Captain America suit with a red, white, and black design.
[111]
Variants of
Captain America's shield
Captain America's shield
is the character's primary piece of equipment. It is a
round shield
with a design featuring a white star on a blue circle surrounded by red and white rings. First appearing in
Captain America Comics
#1 as a triangular
heater shield
, beginning in
Captain America Comics
#2 it was changed to its current circular design due to a complaint from
MLJ Comics
that the original design too closely resembled the chest symbol of their superhero
The Shield
.
[20]
The shield is depicted as constructed from an alloy of
vibranium
and
adamantium
, two highly resilient
fictional metals
appearing in Marvel comic books. It is portrayed as both a virtually indestructible defensive object and a highly aerodynamic offensive weapon: when thrown, it is capable of ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to the original thrower.
[107]
Supporting cast
Sidekicks and partners
Captain America's first
sidekick
was
Bucky Barnes
, introduced in
Captain America Comics
#1 as the teenaged "mascot" of Steve Rogers' regiment. He is made Captain America's partner in that same issue after accidentally discovering the character's secret identity.
[112]
Joe Simon described Bucky's creation as being largely motivated by a need to give Captain America "someone to talk to" and avoid the overuse of dialogue delivered through
internal monologue
, noting that "Bucky was brought in as a way of eliminating too many
thought balloons
."
[4]
Bucky was retroactively established as having been killed in the same accident that left Captain America frozen in suspended animation; the character remained deceased for many decades, contrasting the typically ephemeral nature of
comic book deaths
,
[113]
until he returned in 2005 as the Winter Soldier. Initially introduced as a brainwashed assassin and antagonist to Captain America, Bucky's memories and personality were later restored, and he was re-established as an ally to Steve Rogers.
[114]
Rick Jones
briefly assumed the role of Captain America's sidekick and the public identity of Bucky following Captain America's return to comics in the 1960s.
[115]
[46]
In 1969,
Sam Wilson
was introduced as the superhero Falcon and later became Captain America's sidekick, making the characters the first interracial superhero duo in American comic books.
[38]
Possessing the power to communicate with birds, Wilson is initially depicted as a former
social worker
living in
Harlem
, though this identity is revealed to be the result of memories implanted by the Red Skull. He later receives a winged suit from the superhero
Black Panther
that enables him to fly.
[116]
Other characters who have served as Rogers' sidekick include
Golden Girl
(Betsy Ross),
Demolition Man
(Dennis Dunphy),
Jack Flag
(Jack Harrison), and
Free Spirit
(Cathy Webster).
[115]
[117]
Enemies
Main article:
List of Captain America enemies
Over the course of several decades, writers and artists have established a
rogues' gallery
of
supervillains
to face Captain America. The character's primary archenemy is the
Red Skull
, introduced from the character's origins as an apprentice to
Adolf Hitler
.
[12]
[118]
Just as Red Skull represents
Nazism
, many of Captain America's villains represent specific ideologies or political formations: for example, the
Serpent Society
represents labor unionism, and
Flag-Smasher
represents
anti-nationalism
.
[119]
The political character of Captain America's enemies has shifted over time: the character fought enemies associated with communism during his brief revival in the 1950s
[120]
before shifting back to Nazi antagonists in the mid-1960s,
[40]
while comics since 9/11 have frequently depicted the character facing terrorist villains.
[121]
Romantic interests
Steve Rogers' first love interest was Betsy Ross, introduced in his World War II-era comics as a member of the
Women's Army Corps
who later became the costumed superhero Golden Girl.
[122]
Peggy Carter
, an American member of the
French Resistance
, was retroactively established in comics published in the 1960s as another of Rogers' wartime lovers.
[123]
When Rogers is revived in the post-war era, he begins a partnership and on-again off-again relationship with
S.H.I.E.L.D.
agent
Sharon Carter
; introduced as Peggy's younger sister, she was later retconned as Peggy's grandniece to reflect Marvel's
floating timeline
.
[124]
In comics published in the 1980s, Rogers dated and became engaged to civilian
Bernie Rosenthal
, though they ended their relationship amicably after Bernie left New York to attend law school.
[125]
In the 1990s, Rogers had a romantic entanglement with the alternately villainous and antiheroic
Diamondback
, a member of the
Serpent Society
.
[126]
Alternate versions of Captain America
Main article:
Alternative versions of Captain America
The title of "Captain America" has been used by other characters in the
Marvel Universe
in addition to Steve Rogers, including
William Naslund
,
Jeffrey Mace
, and
William Burnside
.
[127]
John Walker
, also known as U.S. Agent, was introduced as a villainous Captain America in 1988,
[128]
and
Isaiah Bradley
was established in the 2003
limited series
Truth: Red, White & Black
as an African American man who acquired superpowers after being used as a test subject for the Super-Soldier Serum.
[129]
Rogers' sidekicks Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson have also alternately held the title of Captain America: Barnes in 2008 following
Rogers' death in 2007
,
[128]
and Wilson following Marvel's 2012 rebranding campaign
Marvel Now!
.
[130]
Within the
multiverse
of
parallel universes
that compose the Marvel Universe, there are many variations of Steve Rogers and Captain America; this includes Marvel's
Ultimate Comics
universe, which possesses
its own version of Steve Rogers
that is more overtly politically conservative.
[131]
Cultural impact and legacy
"Over the years, Captain America's story has accurately reflected U.S. attitudes, as our country moved from the self-confidence of the early Cold War to the guilt-ridden angst of the 1970s to the revival of national pride that characterized the Reagan 1980s."
- Jacob Heilbrun,
The Los Angeles Times
[132]
Captain America is one of the most popular and widely recognized Marvel Comics characters, and has been described as an icon of
American popular culture
.
[133]
[80]
He is the most well-known and enduring of the
United States-themed superheroes
to emerge from the Second World War
[134]
[135]
and inspired a proliferation of patriotic-themed superheroes in American comic books during the 1940s.
[134]
This included the
American Crusader
, the
Spirit of '76
,
Yank & Doodle
,
Captain Flag
, and
Captain Courageous
, among numerous others.
[135]
Though none would achieve Captain America's commercial success, the volume of Captain America imitators was such that three months after the character's debut, Timely published a statement indicating that "there is only one Captain America" and warning that they would take legal action against publishers that infringed on the character.
[135]
After being dismissed from Timely, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby would themselves create a new patriotic superhero, the
Fighting American
, for
Prize Comics
in 1954;
[136]
the character became the subject of a lawsuit from Marvel in the 1990s after Rob Liefeld attempted to revive the character following his own departure from Marvel.
[63]
When the character was killed in 2007, he was eulogized in numerous mainstream media outlets, including
The New York Times
[137]
and
The Los Angeles Times
,
[132]
with the former describing him as a "national hero".
[137]
In 2011, Captain America placed sixth on
IGN
's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time",
[138]
and second in their 2012 list of "The Top 50 Avengers".
[139]
Gizmodo
and
Entertainment Weekly
respectively ranked Captain America first and second in their 2015 rankings of Avengers characters.
[140]
[141]
Empire
ranked Captain America as the 21st greatest comic book character of all time.

) who refuses to sit down. After he sits down twice and finally gets shot by Egghead when he will not stay down, out comes Daffy Duck biting his nose. While fighting, a tortoise (imitating radio comic
Parkyakarkus
) comes and tries to give Daffy and Egghead new weapons. When the tortoise goes away, Egghead uses his real gun and Daffy tries to make him
shoot the apple on his head
. Egghead misses every time, so Daffy puts a blind sign, a cup of pencils, and disguise glasses on Egghead.  Daffy then sings a song (considered semi-obligatory for a Merrie Melodies cartoon at the time), and when he concludes, his own reflection in the water surfaces in three dimension and shakes his hand before they swim away together.
Later, Egghead finally manages to capture Daffy by shooting a pair of gloves from his gun, knocking Daffy out and allowing Egghead to place him in a net. Just as Egghead celebrates, a duck from the mental ward (seemingly his reflective doppelgänger from the earlier scene) comes to claim Daffy. He thanks Egghead for helping to catch Daffy, and tells him that Daffy is 100 percent nuts. "Yeah?", Egghead asks. "Yeah!", answers the duck warden. At that moment, both he and Daffy beat Egghead up before woohoo-ing out into the distance. Egghead becomes fed up with the antics and decides to join them as the cartoon ends.

Production notes
[
edit
]
According to the copyright date in the cartoon's original opening title cards from 1937 and in the
Blue Ribbon
Merrie Melodies
reissued opening title cards from 1946, this cartoon began production in 1937. But this was released in theaters on January 1, 1938.
Daffy Duck & Egghead
features the early, zany version of
Daffy Duck
, who spends the film harassing
Egghead
(making his second appearance in this cartoon as a hunter after making his first appearing
Egghead Rides Again
), and also marking the second appearance of Daffy Duck (after
Porky's Duck Hunt
), his first in color, and first where he is given his current name. It includes a set-piece song-and-dance number by Daffy, doing his own variation of "
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down
" (which had recently become the theme for
Looney Tunes
).
[5]
Some scenes were reused from the previous Looney Tune cartoon
Porky's Duck Hunt
, from Daffy nipping the hunter's nose, to his whooping and hollering as he bounced in and out of the water.
This cartoon was re-released into the
Blue Ribbon
Merrie Melodies
program on April 20, 1946. The original opening, credits, and closing title cards were found and restored with the release of the
third volume of the
Looney Tunes Golden Collection
in 2005. However, the audio used for the remastering of this short was taken from the European Turner "dubbed version", hence why the ending rendition of "Merrily We Roll Along" is incorrect.
Censorship
[
edit
]
When the short was aired in the
United States
during the 1990s and 2000s on
Cartoon Network
,
Boomerang
and
The WB
, the scene in which Egghead kills the silhouetted audience member was cut.

UFC 138: Leben vs. Muñoz
was a
mixed martial arts
event held by the
Ultimate Fighting Championship
on November 5, 2011 at
LG Arena
in
Birmingham
, United Kingdom.
[2]
The event aired on the same day, via
tape delay
, on
Spike TV
in the United States and live on
Sportsnet
in Canada.
[3]
The event was the second that the
UFC
has hosted in
Birmingham
, the first was
UFC 89
back in 2008 also featuring
Chris Leben
in the main event.
Background
[
edit
]
After several tentatively scheduled 2011 events
[4]
at various locations around the United Kingdom did not materialize, including
Glasgow
,
Liverpool
, London as well as a planned return to Ireland, it was expected that the organization would not hold an event in the area during 2011.
[5]
The main event was the first non-title five round fight in the history of the
UFC
.
[6]
Mark Scanlon was expected to face
James Head
at this event.
[7]
However, Scanlon was pulled from the bout and replaced by promotional newcomer
John Maguire
[8]
Then, on September 28, Head himself pulled out of the fight due to an undisclosed injury and was replaced by
Justin Edwards
.
[9]
Pascal Krauss
was expected to face
John Hathaway
at this event.
[10]
However, on August 30 Krauss pulled out of the bout citing a shoulder injury, and was replaced by
Matt Brown
.
[11]
Then on October 17 it was announced that Hathaway was forced to withdraw from the bout due to injury as well. As a result, Brown was pulled from the event and will face
Seth Baczynski
at
UFC 139
.
[12]
[13]
Phil De Fries
was expected to face
Oli Thompson
at this event. However, on October 17 it was announced that Thompson was forced to withdraw from the bout due to injury. De Fries fought
Rob Broughton
at this event instead.
[12]
Anthony Njokuani
was scheduled to fight
Paul Taylor
on the main card. However, Taylor sustained a
whiplash
injury during a minor traffic collision on November 1 forcing him from the bout. Due to insufficient time to find a replacement, Njokuani was moved to a future card, while a prelim fight between
Cyrille Diabate
and
Anthony Perosh
was promoted to the main card.
[14]
This event averaged 1.8 million viewers on
Spike TV
.
[15]
After the event
Chris Leben
tested positive for illegal substances and was subsequently suspended for a year.

Shaykh Najjar
(
Arabic
:
شيخ نجار
, also spelled
Sheikh Najjar
) is an industrial city in northern
Syria
, administratively part of the
Aleppo Governorate
, located 10 kilometers northeast of
Aleppo
.
[2]
Nearby localities include
Kafr Saghir
to the north,
al-Muslimiyah
to the northwest,
Tell Shaghib
to the south and
Fah
to the southeast. According to the
Syria Central Bureau of Statistics
(CBS), Shaykh Najjar had a population of 2,588 in the 2004 census.
[1]
Industrial city
[
edit
]
Shaykh Najjar is a relatively new development and is the closest Syrian industrial center to the border with
Turkey
. By 2010-11, there were 1,923 companies operating in the industrial zone. About 40% of the firms inside the city are Turkish-owned. In addition to proximity, Turkish business owners benefit from tariff-free trade agreements between Syria and Turkey as well as the tariff-free exports of Turkish products made in Syria to the
Arab world
. Investors that open businesses inside the industrial zone are able to be assigned land and have the documents to proceed operations within 24 hours.
[3]
Shaykh Najjar is seen as one of the first urban developments built outside the ring roads of Aleppo. According to Anna I. Del Monaco, an Italian researcher of urban landscapes, Shaykh Najjar has the potential of reducing the "proliferation of industrial zones in the fabric inside the ring roads" and would absorb more workers from the countryside of Aleppo.
[4]
During the ongoing
Syrian civil war
which began in 2011, clashes between the opposition rebels and government forces have resulted in the destruction of hundreds of businesses in Aleppo, including in Shaykh Najjar. According to a
Reuters
report from 4 October 2012, the industrial zone "is now little more than a ghost town where guards try to protect some factories at great risk to their lives."
[5]
By October 2012, around 20 pharmaceutical plants discontinued production, causing the potential risk of a medicine shortage.
[2]
By April 2021, 685 establishments had returned to the industrial city.

1987 speech by South Korean presidential candidate Roh Tae-woo promising democratization
The
June 29 Declaration
(
Korean
:
6.29 선언
;
Hanja
:
六二九宣言
;
RR
:
Yug-igu seoneon
), officially titled the
Special Declaration for Grand National Harmony and Progress Towards a Great Nation
[1]
[2]
(
Korean
:
국민들의 민주화와 직선제 개헌요구를 받아들여 발표한 특별선언
), was a speech by
Roh Tae-woo
, presidential candidate of the ruling
Democratic Justice Party
of
South Korea
, on 29 June 1987. In the declaration, Roh promised significant concessions to opponents of the incumbent
authoritarian
regime of
Chun Doo-hwan
who had been pressing for democracy. Roh went on to win the open
presidential elections
that were held that year, the first for at least the fifteen years since the
October Yushin
of 1972.
The question of the role of the June 29 Declaration is important in the
historiography
of South Korean
democratization
. According to proponents of the view that this was a "pacted" transition, achieved by calculated compromise by the ruling elite, the June 29 Declaration was the crucial turning point in the development of these calculations.
[3]
"Pacted" transition theorists point to the authoritarian methods of
Roh's subsequent regime
, which continued the political manipulation and
trasformismo
of the Chun government, as evidence for the thesis that the June 29 Declaration was simply a tactic that enabled the perpetuation of authoritarian rule.
[4]
"Mass" transition theorists, by contrast, believe that the Declaration was merely a response to the
June Democracy Movement
, and the democratization process was driven by the force of popular demand rather than elite bargaining.
[3]
The Declaration comprised eight points, in which Roh promised to:
amend
the
constitution
to provide for the
direct election
of the president;
revise the presidential election law to ensure free candidature and genuinely competitive elections;
grant
amnesty
to
political prisoners
, including
Kim Dae-jung
;
protect human dignity and extend the right of
habeas corpus
;
abolish the Basic Press Law and restore the
freedom of the press
;
strengthen local and educational autonomy;
move the
political climate
towards dialogue and compromise; and
achieve substantial social reform.
[5]
The declaration began to be realized later that year with the promulgation of the constitution of the
Sixth Republic of Korea
in October.

The
Byzantine Empire
,
[note 1]
also referred to as the
Eastern Roman Empire
, was the continuation of the
Roman Empire
primarily in its eastern provinces during
Late Antiquity
and the
Middle Ages
, when its capital city was
Constantinople
. It survived the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
in the 5th century AD and continued to exist until the
fall of Constantinople
to the
Ottoman Empire
in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the
Mediterranean world
. Its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire and to themselves as Romans.
[note 2]
Modern historians distinguish the Byzantine Empire from the earlier Roman Empire due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to
Byzantium
, the
empire's integration of Christianity
, and the predominance of
Greek
instead of
Latin
.
[5]
During the high period of the Roman Empire known as the
Pax Romana
, the western parts of the empire went through
Latinization
, while the eastern parts of the empire maintained to a large degree their
Hellenistic culture
. Several events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire's
Greek East and Latin West
diverged.
Constantine I
(
r.
324-337
) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the capital, and legalised
Christianity
. Under
Theodosius I
(
r.
379-395
), Christianity became the
state religion
, and other religious practices
were proscribed
. In the reign of
Heraclius
(
r.
610-641
), the empire's military and administration were restructured and Greek was gradually adopted for official use in place of Latin.
The borders of the empire fluctuated through several cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of
Justinian I
(
r.
527-565
), the empire reached its greatest extent after the fall of the west, reconquering much of the historically Roman western
Mediterranean coast
. The
Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628
exhausted the empire's resources, and during the
early Muslim conquests
of the 7th century, it lost its richest provinces—
Egypt
and
Syria
—to the
Rashidun Caliphate
. It then lost Africa to the
Umayyad Caliphate
in 698, before the empire was stabilized by the
Isaurian
dynasty. During the
Macedonian dynasty
(9th-11th centuries), the empire expanded again and experienced the two-century-long
Macedonian Renaissance
, which came to an end with the defeat by the
Seljuk Turks
at the
Battle of Manzikert
in 1071. Civil wars and the ensuing Seljuk invasion led to the loss of most of
Asia Minor
. The empire recovered during the
Komnenian restoration
, and up until the Fourth Crusade, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe.
The empire was first dissolved during the
Fourth Crusade
in 1204, when Constantinople was
sacked
by the Latins and the territories that the empire formerly governed
were divided
into competing Byzantine Greek and
Latin realms
. Despite the eventual
recovery of Constantinople
in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained a mere regional power for the final two centuries of its existence. Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans in the
Byzantine-Ottoman wars
over the 14th and 15th centuries. The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire. Refugees fleeing the city after its capture would settle in Italy and other parts of Europe, helping to ignite the
Renaissance
. The fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans is sometimes used to mark the end of the Middle Ages and the start of the
early modern period
.
Nomenclature
See also:
Names of the Greeks
The adjective "Byzantine" is derived from
Byzantion
, latinized as
Byzantium
, which was the name of the existing Greek settlement where Constantine I chose to locate his new capital of Constantinople.
[6]
[7]
Initially, "Byzantine" referred to the inhabitants of Constantinople.
[8]
It was only following the demise of the empire in the 15th century that
Laonikos Chalkokondyles
first used the word "Byzantine" to describe the state.
[9]
Hieronymus Wolf
's
Historiæ Byzantinæ
, which includes Chalkokondyles, marks the start of Byzantine studies.
[10]
Du Cange
,
Montesquieu
and
Finlay
popularised the term through their works.
[11]
It was not until the 19th century that the 8th-century term "Empire of the Greeks" was replaced with the modern convention of the "Byzantine Empire".
[12]
[13]
The Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as the "Roman Empire" or the "Empire of the Romans", Romania,
[note 3]
the
Roman Republic
,
[note 4]
[16]
or in Greek "Rhōmais".
[17]
The inhabitants called themselves
Romaioi,
and even as late as the 19th century Greeks typically referred to
Modern Greek
as
Romaiika
.
[18]
After 1204, when the Byzantine Empire consisted purely of its Hellenic provinces, the term
'Hellenes'
was increasingly used instead.
[19]
From the 6th century,
[note 5]
the empire's western and northern contemporaries began to identify the empire with its increasingly predominant
Greek element
.
[21]
Starting with
Charlemagne
's
Libri Carolini
in the 790s, the Franks used the term "Empire of the Greeks" (Latin:
Imperium Graecorum
) in order to undercut the Byzantine claim to be the continuation of the Roman Empire.
[22]
In the Islamic world, the Roman Empire was called
Rûm
.
[23]
The name
millet-i Rûm
, or "
Roman nation,
" was used by the Ottomans until the 20th century to refer to the former subjects of the Byzantine Empire, which were the
Orthodox Christian
community within Ottoman realms.
History
Main article:
History of the Byzantine Empire
Early Byzantine history
Rome from the creation of the republic to the rule of the first emperor Augustus
In a
series of conflicts
between the third and first centuries BC, the
Roman Republic
gradually established hegemony in the
Eastern Mediterranean
; nevertheless,
internal instabilities
led to the institution of the
Roman Empire
, ruled by monarchs known as
emperors
. This powerful and multicultural empire reached its apex during the second century AD, after a period of stability known as the
Pax Romana
. It was greatly influenced by the
Hellenistic states
it had conquered in the east—while the western parts of the Roman Empire underwent a process of
Romanization
, the eastern territories, generally more urbanised and developed, kept much of their Hellenistic culture intact.
[24]
The empire nearly collapsed in the
Crisis of the Third Century
, but was stabilized during the reign of
Aurelian
(
r.
270-275
), who reconquered seceded territories. Because of their comparative prosperity, the eastern territories were less affected by the crisis than the west; the two halves became gradually estranged.
[24]
The reforms of
Diocletian
(
r.
284-305
) restructured the empire from the pseudo-republican
Principate
into the openly-
autocratic
Dominate
, complete with a vast imperial bureaucracy. His
Tetrarchy
divided the empire into eastern and western halves; it proved an enduring concept, even though it lasted less than fifty years after
civil wars
and the accession of
Constantine the Great
in 324.
[25]
Christianisation and partition of the empire
See also:
Byzantine Empire under the Constantinian and Valentinianic dynasties
Restored section of the
Walls of Constantinople
Constantine the Great
was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity and moved the seat of the empire to
Byzantium
, renamed
Constantinople
in his honour.
Division of the empire after the death of Theodosius I in 395. The west
disintegrated in the late 400s
while the east ended with the
fall of Constantinople
in 1453.
The Western Roman Empire
The Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire
In 330, Constantine moved the seat of the empire to Constantinople, which he founded as a second Rome on the site of Byzantium, a city strategically located on the trade routes between Europe and Asia and between the Mediterranean and the
Black Sea
. Constantine introduced substantial changes to the empire's military, monetary, civil and religious institutions. In regards to his economic policies he has been accused by certain scholars of "reckless fiscality", but the gold
solidus
he introduced became a stable currency that transformed the economy and promoted development.
[26]
Under Constantine, Christianity did not become the exclusive religion of the state but enjoyed imperial preference since
he supported it with generous privileges
. Constantine established the principle that emperors could not settle questions of doctrine on their own but should instead summon
general ecclesiastical councils
for that purpose. His convening of both the
Synod of Arles
and the
First Council of Nicaea
indicated his interest in the unity of the Church and showcased his claim to be its head.
[27]
The rise of Christianity was briefly interrupted on the accession of the emperor
Julian
in 361, who made a determined effort to restore polytheism throughout the empire and was thus dubbed "Julian the Apostate" by the Church.
[28]
However, this was reversed when Julian was killed in battle in 363.
[29]
Theodosius I
(379-395) was the last emperor to rule both the Eastern and Western halves of the empire. In 391 and 392 he
issued a series of edicts essentially banning pagan religion
. Pagan festivals and sacrifices were banned, as was access to all pagan temples and places of worship.
[30]
The last
Olympic Games
are believed to have been held in 393.
[31]
In 395, Theodosius I bequeathed the imperial office jointly to his sons:
Arcadius
in the East and
Honorius
in the West, once again dividing imperial administration. In the 5th century, the Eastern part of the empire was largely spared the difficulties faced by the West—due in part to a more established urban culture and greater financial resources, which allowed it to placate invaders with
tribute
and pay foreign mercenaries. This success allowed
Theodosius II
to focus on codifying Roman law with the
Codex Theodosianus
and further fortification of
the walls of Constantinople
, which left the city impervious to most attacks until 1204.
[32]
To fend off the
Huns
, Theodosius had to pay an enormous annual tribute to
Attila
. His successor,
Marcian
, refused to continue to pay the tribute, but Attila had already diverted his attention to the
Western Roman Empire
. After Attila's death in 453, the Hun Empire collapsed, and many of the remaining Huns were often hired as mercenaries by Constantinople.
[33]
Loss of the Western Roman Empire
After the fall of Attila, the Eastern Empire enjoyed a period of peace, while the Western Empire
continued to deteriorate
with the expanding
migration and invasions
of the
barbarians
, most prominently the
Germanic nations
. The West's end is usually dated 476 when the
East Germanic
Roman
foederati
general
Odoacer
deposed the Western Emperor
Romulus Augustulus
, a year after the latter usurped the position from
Julius Nepos
.
[34]
In 480 with the death of Nepos,
Eastern Emperor
Zeno
became sole claimant to emperor of the empire. Odoacer became
King of Italy
and was nominally Zeno's subordinate but acted with complete autonomy, eventually providing support to a rebellion against the emperor.
[35]
Zeno negotiated with the invading
Ostrogoths
, who had settled in
Moesia
, convincing the Gothic king
Theodoric
to depart for Italy as
magister militum per Italiam
("commander in chief for Italy") to depose Odoacer. By urging Theodoric to conquer Italy, Zeno rid the Eastern Empire of an unruly subordinate (Odoacer) and moved another (Theodoric) further from the heart of the empire. After Odoacer's defeat in 493, Theodoric ruled Italy
de facto
, although he was never recognised by the eastern emperors as "king" (
rex
).
[35]
In 491,
Anastasius I
, an aged civil officer of
Roman origin
, became emperor, but it was not until 497 that the forces of Anastasius effectively took the measure of
Isaurian resistance
.
[36]
Anastasius revealed himself as an energetic reformer and an able administrator. He introduced a new coinage system of the copper
follis
, the coin used in most everyday transactions.
[37]
He also reformed the tax system and permanently abolished the
chrysargyron
tax. The
state treasury
contained the enormous sum of 320,000 lb (150,000 kg) of gold when Anastasius died in 518 (roughly worth US$8.3 billion today).

The Byzantine Empire in
c.
600
during the reign of Maurice. Half of the Italian peninsula and most of southern Hispania were lost, but positions in
north Africa
maintained and the eastern borders expanded, gaining land from the Persians.
The rise of Justinian I
The Justinian dynasty was founded by
Justin I
, who though illiterate, rose through the ranks of the
Byzantine army
to become emperor in 518.
[40]
He was succeeded by his nephew
Justinian I
in 527, who may already have exerted effective control during Justin's reign.
[41]
One of the most important figures of late antiquity and possibly the last Roman emperor to speak Latin as a first language,
[42]
Justinian's rule constitutes a distinct epoch, marked by the ambitious but only partly realised
renovatio imperii
, or "restoration of the empire".
[43]
Justinian's wife
Theodora
was particularly influential.
[44]
In 529, Justinian appointed a ten-man commission chaired by
John the Cappadocian
to revise Roman law and create a new codification of laws and jurists' extracts, known as the "
Corpus Juris Civilis
", or the Justinian Code. In 534, the
Corpus
was updated and, along with the
enactments promulgated by Justinian after 534
, formed the system of law used for most of the rest of the Byzantine era.
[45]
The
Corpus
forms the basis of
civil law
of many modern states.
[46]
Renovatio imperii and the wars of Justinian
In 532, attempting to secure his eastern frontier, Justinian signed a peace treaty with
Khosrau I of Persia
, agreeing to pay a large annual tribute to the
Sassanids
. In the same year, he survived a revolt in Constantinople (the
Nika riots
), which solidified his power but ended with the deaths of a reported 30,000 to 35,000 rioters on his orders.
[47]
The western conquests began in 533, as Justinian sent his general
Belisarius
to reclaim the former province of
Africa
from the
Vandals
, who had been in control since 429 with their capital at
Carthage
.
[48]
Success in the war
came with surprising ease, but it was not until 548 that the major local tribes were subdued.
[49]
In 535, a small Byzantine
expedition to Sicily
met with easy success, but the
Goths
stiffened their resistance, and victory did not come until 540 when Belisarius captured
Ravenna
, after successful sieges of
Naples
and
Rome
.
[50]
In 535-536,
Ostrogoth
King
Theodahad
sent
Pope Agapetus I
to Constantinople to request the removal of Byzantine forces from Sicily,
Dalmatia
, and Italy. Although Agapetus failed in his mission to sign a peace with Justinian, he succeeded in having the
monophysite
Patriarch
Anthimus I
denounced at the
Council of Constantinople
, despite Empress Theodora's support and protection.
[51]
The Ostrogoths
captured Rome
in 546. Belisarius, who had been sent back to Italy in 544, was eventually recalled to Constantinople in 549.
[52]
The arrival of the Armenian eunuch
Narses
in Italy (late 551) with an army of 35,000 men marked another shift in Gothic fortunes. Ostrogoth King
Totila
was defeated at the
Battle of Taginae
, and his successor
Teia
was defeated at the
Battle of Mons Lactarius
in October 552. Despite continuing resistance from a few Gothic garrisons and two subsequent invasions by the
Franks
and
Alemanni
, the war for the Italian peninsula was at an end.
[53]
In 551,
Athanagild
, a noble from
Visigothic
Hispania
, sought Justinian's help in a rebellion against the king, and the emperor dispatched a force under
Liberius
, a successful military commander. The empire held on to a small slice of the
Iberian Peninsula
coast until the reign of
Heraclius
.
[54]
In the east, the
Roman-Persian Wars
continued until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau agreed on a 50-year peace.
[55]
By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the
Balkans
, which were subjected to repeated incursions from the
Slavs
and the
Gepids
. Tribes of
Serbs
and
Croats
were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, during the reign of Heraclius.
[56]
Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and
defeated the new Hunnish threat
. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the
Kutrigur
Huns to withdraw, and they agreed to a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.
[57]
Transition into an eastern Christian empire
Nika riots
started in
Hippodrome of Constantinople
during the reign of Emperor Justinian I.
Although polytheism had been
suppressed by the state
since at least the time of Theodosius I in the 4th century, traditional Greco-Roman culture was still influential in the Eastern empire in the 6th century.
[58]
Hellenistic philosophy
began to be gradually amalgamated into newer
Christian philosophy
. Philosophers such as
John Philoponus
drew on
neoplatonic
ideas in addition to Christian thought and
empiricism
. Because of the active paganism of its professors, Justinian closed down the
Neoplatonic Academy
in 529. Other schools continued in Constantinople,
Antioch
and
Alexandria
, which were the centres of Justinian's empire.
[59]
Hymns written by
Romanos the Melodist
marked the development of the
Divine Liturgy
, while the architects
Isidore of Miletus
and
Anthemius of Tralles
worked to complete the Church of the
Holy Wisdom
,
Hagia Sophia
, which was designed to replace an older church destroyed during the Nika Revolt. Completed in 537, the Hagia Sophia stands today as one of the major monuments of Byzantine architectural history.
[60]
During the 6th and 7th centuries, the empire was struck by a
series of epidemics
, which devastated the population and contributed to a significant economic decline and a weakening of the empire.
[61]
Great
bathhouses
were built in Byzantine centres such as Constantinople and Antioch.
[62]
Decline of the Justinian dynasty
After Justinian died in 565, his successor,
Justin II
, refused to pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic
Lombards
invaded Italy; by the end of the century, only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin II's successor,
Tiberius II
, choosing between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the
Avars
while taking military action against the Persians. Although Tiberius' general,
Maurice
, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars, who
captured the Balkan fortress
of
Sirmium
in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.
[63]
Maurice succeeded Tiberius and intervened in a Persian civil war, placing the legitimate
Khosrau II
back on the throne, and married his daughter to him. Maurice's treaty with his son-in-law enlarged the territories of the empire to the East and allowed the energetic emperor to focus on the Balkans. By 602, a
series of successful Byzantine campaigns
had pushed the Avars and Slavs back across the Danube.
[63]
However, Maurice's refusal to ransom several thousand captives taken by the Avars, and his order to the troops to winter in the Danube, caused his popularity to plummet. A revolt broke out under an officer named Phocas, who marched the troops back to Constantinople; Maurice and his family were murdered while trying to escape.
[64]
Arab invasions and shrinking borders
Early Heraclian dynasty
Further information:

Piero della Francesca
,
c.
1452
By 650 (pictured) the empire had lost all its southern provinces, except the
Exarchate of Africa
, to the Rashidun Caliphate. At the same time the Slavs invaded and settled in the Balkans.
After Maurice's murder by
Phocas
, Khosrau used the pretext to reconquer the
Roman province of Mesopotamia
.
[65]
Phocas, an unpopular ruler invariably described in Byzantine sources as a "tyrant", was the target of a number of Senate-led plots. He was eventually
deposed in 610 by Heraclius
, who sailed to Constantinople from Carthage with an icon affixed to the prow of his ship.
[66]
Following the accession of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed deep into the
Levant
, occupying
Damascus
and
Jerusalem
and removing the
True Cross
to
Ctesiphon
.
[67]
The
counter-attack launched by Heraclius
took on the character of a holy war, and an
acheiropoieton
image of Christ was carried as a military standard
[68]
(similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar-Sassanid-Slavic
siege in 626
, the victory was attributed to the icons of the
Virgin
that were led in procession by
Patriarch Sergius
about the walls of the city).
[69]
The combined forces unsuccessfully besieged the capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to
Anatolia
. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother
Theodore
heavily defeated the Persian general
Shahin
.
[70]
Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.
The main Sassanid force
was destroyed at Nineveh
in 627, and in 629 Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in a majestic ceremony,
[71]
as he marched into the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, where
anarchy and civil war reigned
as a result of the enduring war. Eventually, the Persians were obliged to withdraw all armed forces and return Sassanid-ruled
Egypt
, the Levant and whatever imperial territories of Mesopotamia and
Armenia
were in Roman hands at the time of an earlier peace treaty in
c.
595
. The war had exhausted both the Byzantines and Sassanids, however, and left them extremely vulnerable to the
Muslim forces
that emerged in the following years.
[72]
The Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat by the Arabs at the
Battle of Yarmouk
in 636, while
Ctesiphon fell
to the
Rashidun Caliphate
in 637.
[73]
First Arab siege of Constantinople (674-678) and the theme system
Greek fire
was first used by the
Byzantine Navy
during the
Byzantine-Arab Wars
(from the
Madrid Skylitzes
,
Biblioteca Nacional de España
, Madrid).
The Arabs, firmly in control of Syria and the Levant, sent frequent raiding parties deep into Asia Minor, and in
674-678 laid siege to Constantinople
. The Arab fleet was finally repulsed through the use of
Greek fire
, and a thirty-years' truce was signed between the empire and the
Umayyad Caliphate
.
[74]
However, the Anatolian raids continued unabated and accelerated the demise of classical urban culture, with the inhabitants of many cities either refortifying much smaller areas within the old city walls or relocating entirely to nearby fortresses.
[75]
Constantinople shrank substantially from 500,000 inhabitants to just 40,000-70,000, and, like other urban centres, it was partly ruralised. The city also lost the free grain shipments in 618, after Egypt fell first to the Persians and then to the Arabs, and public wheat distribution ceased.
[76]
The void left by the disappearance of the old semi-autonomous civic institutions was filled by the system called
theme
, which entailed dividing Asia Minor into "provinces" occupied by distinct armies that assumed civil authority and answered directly to the imperial administration. This system may have had its roots in certain
ad hoc
measures taken by Heraclius, but over the course of the 7th century it developed into an entirely new system of imperial governance.
[77]
The massive cultural and institutional restructuring of the empire consequent on the loss of territory in the 7th century has been said to have caused a decisive break in east Mediterranean
Romanness
, and that the Byzantine state is subsequently best understood as another successor state rather than a real continuation of the Roman Empire.
[78]
Late Heraclian dynasty

Twenty Years' Anarchy
Constantine IV
and his retinue, mosaic in
Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe
. Constantine IV defeated the
First Arab siege of Constantinople
.
The withdrawal of large numbers of troops from the Balkans to combat the Persians and then the Arabs in the east opened the door for the gradual southward expansion of Slavic peoples into the peninsula, and, as in Asia Minor, many cities shrank to small fortified settlements.
[79]
In the 670s, the
Bulgars
were pushed south of the Danube by the arrival of the
Khazars
. In 680, Byzantine forces sent to disperse these new settlements were defeated.
[80]
In 681,
Constantine IV
signed a treaty with the Bulgar Khan
Asparukh
, and the
new Bulgarian state
assumed sovereignty over several Slavic tribes that had previously, at least in name, recognised Byzantine rule.
[80]
In 687-688, the final Heraclian emperor,
Justinian II
, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians and made significant gains, although the fact that he had to fight his way from
Thrace
to
Macedonia
demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.
[81]
Justinian II attempted to break the power of the urban aristocracy through severe taxation and the appointment of "outsiders" to administrative posts. He was driven from power in 695 and took shelter first with the Khazars and then with the
Bulgarians
. In 705, he returned to Constantinople with the armies of the Bulgarian Khan
Tervel
, retook the throne and instituted a reign of terror against his enemies. With his final overthrow in 711, supported once more by the urban aristocracy, the Heraclian dynasty came to an end.

In 717 the Umayyad Caliphate launched a
siege on Constantinople
which lasted for one year. However, the combination of
Leo III the Isaurian
's military genius, the Byzantines' use of Greek fire, a cold winter in 717-718, and Byzantine diplomacy with the Khan Tervel of Bulgaria resulted in a Byzantine victory. After Leo III turned back the Muslim assault in 718, he addressed himself to the task of reorganising and consolidating the
themes
in Asia Minor. In 740 a major Byzantine victory took place at the
Battle of Akroinon
where the Byzantines destroyed the Umayyad army.
[83]
Constantine V won noteworthy victories in northern Syria and also thoroughly undermined Bulgarian strength.
[84]
In 746, profiting by the
unstable conditions
in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was falling apart under
Marwan II
, Constantine V invaded Syria and captured
Germanikeia
, and the
Battle of Keramaia
resulted in a major Byzantine naval victory over the Umayyad fleet. Coupled with military defeats on other fronts of the caliphate and internal instability, Umayyad expansion came to an end.
Religious dispute over iconoclasm
Main article:
Byzantine iconoclasm
A Simple Cross: An example of
Iconoclast
art in the
Hagia Irene
Church in Istanbul.
The 8th and early 9th centuries were also dominated by controversy and religious division over
Iconoclasm
, which was the main political issue in the empire for over a century.
Icons
(here meaning all forms of religious imagery) were banned by Leo and Constantine from around 730, leading to revolts by
iconodules
(supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of Empress
Irene
, the
Second Council of Nicaea
met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshipped. Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and
Charlemagne
, but according to
Theophanes the Confessor
the scheme was frustrated by
Aetios
, one of her advisors.
[85]
In the early 9th century,
Leo V
reintroduced the policy of iconoclasm, but in 843 Empress
Theodora
restored the veneration of icons with the help of
Patriarch Methodios
.
[86]
Iconoclasm played a part in the further alienation of East from West, which worsened during the so-called
Photian schism
when
Pope Nicholas I
challenged the elevation of
Photios
to the patriarchate.

Macedonian dynasty and resurgence (867-1025)

Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty
The Byzantine Empire,
c.
867
The accession of
Basil I
to the throne in 867 marks the beginning of the
Macedonian dynasty
, which ruled for 150 years. This dynasty included some of the ablest emperors in Byzantium's history, and
the period is one of revival
. The empire moved from defending against external enemies to reconquest of territories.
[88]
The Macedonian dynasty was characterised by a cultural revival in spheres such as philosophy and the arts. There was a conscious effort to restore the brilliance of the period before the
Slavic
and subsequent Arab invasions, and the Macedonian era has been dubbed the "Golden Age" of Byzantium.
[88]
Although the empire was significantly smaller than during the reign of Justinian I, it had regained much strength, as the remaining territories were less geographically dispersed and more politically, economically, and culturally integrated.

Taking advantage of the empire's weakness after the
Revolt of Thomas the Slav
in the early 820s, the Arabs re-emerged and
captured Crete
. They also successfully attacked Sicily, but in 863 general
Petronas
gained a decisive victory at the
Battle of Lalakaon
against
Umar al-Aqta
, the
emir
of Melitene (
Malatya
). Under the leadership of Emperor
Krum
, the Bulgarian threat also re-emerged, but in 815-816 Krum's son,
Omurtag
, signed a
peace treaty
with
Leo V
.
[89]
In the 830s the
Abbasid Caliphate
started military excursions culminating with a victory in the
Sack of Amorium
. The Byzantines then counter-attacked and
sacked Damietta
in Egypt. Later the Abbasid Caliphate responded by sending their troops into Anatolia again, sacking and marauding until they were eventually annihilated by the Byzantines at the
Battle of Lalakaon
in 863.
In the early years of
Basil I
's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia and the
siege of Ragusa (866-868)
were defeated, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control. This enabled Byzantine missionaries to penetrate to the interior and
convert the Serbs
and the principalities of modern-day
Herzegovina
and
Montenegro
to Christianity.
[90]
By contrast, the Byzantine position in
Southern Italy
was gradually consolidated; by 873
Bari
was once again under Byzantine rule, and most of Southern Italy remained in the empire for the next 200 years.
[90]
[91]
On the more important eastern front, the empire rebuilt its defences and went on the offensive. The
Paulicians
were defeated at the
Battle of Bathys Ryax
and their capital of Tephrike (
Divrigi
) taken, while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of
Samosata
.
[90]
10th century military successes were coupled with a major cultural revival, the so-called
Macedonian Renaissance
. Miniature from the
Paris Psalter

Under Basil's son and successor,
Leo VI the Wise
, the gains in the east against the enfeebled Abbasid Caliphate continued.
Sicily was lost
to the Arabs in 902, and in 904
Thessaloniki
, the empire's second city,
was sacked
by an Arab fleet. The naval weakness of the empire was rectified. Despite this revenge, the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain
Crete
in 911.
[92]
The death of the Bulgarian Emperor
Simeon I
in 927 severely weakened the Bulgarians, allowing the Byzantines to concentrate on the eastern front.
[93]
Melitene
was permanently recaptured in 934, and in 943 the famous general
John Kourkouas
continued the offensive in Mesopotamia with some noteworthy victories, culminating in the reconquest of
Edessa
. Kourkouas was especially celebrated for returning to Constantinople the venerated
Mandylion
, a relic purportedly imprinted with a portrait of Jesus.
[94]
The soldier-emperors
Nikephoros II Phokas
(
r.
963-969
) and
John I Tzimiskes
(969-976) expanded the empire well into Syria, defeating the emirs of northwest
Iraq
. Nikephoros
took Aleppo
in 962, and the Arabs were decisively expelled from Crete in 963. The recapture of Crete in the
siege of Chandax
put an end to Arab raids in the Aegean, allowing mainland Greece to flourish again.
Cyprus
was permanently retaken in 965, and the successes of Nikephoros culminated in 969 with the
siege of Antioch
and its recapture, which he incorporated as a province of the empire.
[95]
His successor John Tzimiskes recaptured Damascus,
Beirut
,
Acre
,
Sidon
,
Caesarea
and
Tiberias
, putting Byzantine armies within striking distance of Jerusalem, although the Muslim power centres in Iraq and Egypt were left untouched.
[96]
After much campaigning in the north, the last Arab threat to Byzantium, the rich province of Sicily, was targeted in 1025 by
Basil II
, who died before the expedition could be completed. By that time the empire stretched from the straits of
Messina
to the
Euphrates
and from the Danube to Syria.

Emperor
Basil II
(
r.
976-1025
)
The extent of the empire under
Basil II
The traditional struggle with the
See of Rome
continued through the Macedonian period, spurred by the question of religious supremacy over the
newly Christianised
state of Bulgaria.
[88]
Ending eighty years of peace between the two states, the powerful Bulgarian
Tsar
Simeon I
invaded in 894 but was pushed back by the Byzantines, who used their fleet to sail up the
Black Sea
to attack the Bulgarian rear, enlisting the support of the
Hungarians
.
[98]
The Byzantines were defeated at the
Battle of Boulgarophygon
in 896, however, and agreed to pay annual subsidies to the Bulgarians.
[92]
Leo the Wise
died in 912, and hostilities resumed as Simeon marched to Constantinople at the head of a large army.
[99]
Although the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was in disarray and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of
basileus
(emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young Emperor
Constantine VII
marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered
Adrianople
.
[100]
The empire now faced the problem of a powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople,
[88]
as well as having to fight on two fronts.
[92]
A great imperial expedition under
Leo Phocas
and
Romanos I Lekapenos
ended with another crushing Byzantine defeat at the
Battle of Achelous
in 917, and the following year the Bulgarians were free to ravage northern Greece. Adrianople was plundered again in 923, and a Bulgarian army laid siege to Constantinople in 924. Simeon died suddenly in 927, however, and Bulgarian power collapsed with him. Bulgaria and Byzantium entered a long period of peaceful relations, and the empire was free to concentrate on the eastern front against the Muslims.
[101]
In 968, Bulgaria was overrun by the
Rus'
under
Sviatoslav I
, but three years later,
John I Tzimiskes
defeated the Rus'
and re-incorporated eastern Bulgaria into the Byzantine Empire.
[102]
Bulgarian resistance revived under the rule of the
Cometopuli dynasty
, but Emperor
Basil II
(
r.
976-1025
) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal.
[103]
Basil's first expedition against Bulgaria, however, resulted in a defeat at the
Gates of Trajan
. For the next few years, the emperor was preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia, while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans. The war dragged on for nearly twenty years. The Byzantine victories of
Spercheios
and
Skopje
decisively weakened the Bulgarian army, and in annual campaigns Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds.
[103]
At the
Battle of Kleidion
in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated: their army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the hundredth man left with one eye so he could lead his compatriots home. When Tsar
Samuil
saw the broken remains of his once formidable army, he died of shock. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered, and the country became part of the empire.
[103]
This victory restored the Danube frontier, which had not been held since the days of the Emperor Heraclius.
[97]
Relations with the Kievan Rus'
Rus'
under the walls of Constantinople (860)
Varangian Guardsmen, an illumination from the
Skylitzis Chronicle
Between 850 and 1100, the empire developed a mixed relationship with the
Kievan Rus'
, which had emerged to the north across the Black Sea.
[104]
This relationship had long-lasting repercussions in the history of the
East Slavs
, and the empire quickly became the main
trading and cultural partner
for
Kiev
. The Rus' launched their first
attack against Constantinople
in 860, pillaging the suburbs of the city. In 941,
they appeared on the Asian shore
of the Bosphorus, but this time they were crushed, an indication of the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when
only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders
.
Basil II
could not ignore the emerging power of the Rus', and following the example of his predecessors he used religion as a means for achieving political purposes.
[105]
Rus'-Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of
Anna Porphyrogeneta
to
Vladimir the Great
in 988, and the subsequent
Christianisation of the Rus'
.
[104]
Byzantine priests, architects, and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further, while numerous Rus' served in the Byzantine army as mercenaries, most notably as the famous
Varangian Guard
.
[104]
Even after the Christianisation of the Rus', however, relations were not always friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was an
invasion of Bulgaria in 968
, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', such as the one concluded at the end of
the war of 1043
, during which the Rus' indicated their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.
[105]
Campaigns in the Caucasus
Main articles:
Byzantine-Georgian wars
and
Byzantine-Seljuk wars
Between 1021 and 1022, following years of tensions, Basil II led a series of victorious campaigns against the
Kingdom of Georgia
, resulting in the annexation of several Georgian provinces to the empire. Basil's successors also annexed
Bagratid Armenia
in 1045. Importantly, both Georgia and Armenia were significantly weakened by the Byzantine administration's policy of heavy taxation and abolishing of the levy. The weakening of Georgia and Armenia played a significant role in the Byzantine
defeat at Manzikert
in 1071.
[106]
Apex
Constantinople
was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe throughout late antiquity and most of the Middle Ages until the
Fourth Crusade
in 1204.
Basil II is considered among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as the apex of the empire in the
Middle Ages
. By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to
Calabria
in southern Italy in the west.
[97]
Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the
reconquests of Crete
,
Cyprus
, and the important city of
Antioch
. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.
[90]
Leo VI achieved the complete
codification of Byzantine law
in Greek. This monumental work of 60 volumes became the foundation of all subsequent Byzantine law and is still studied today.
[107]
Leo also reformed the administration of the empire, redrawing the borders of the administrative subdivisions (the
themata
, or "themes") and tidying up the system of ranks and privileges, as well as regulating the behaviour of the various trade guilds in Constantinople. Leo's reform did much to reduce the previous fragmentation of the empire, which henceforth had one centre of power, Constantinople.
[108]
However, the increasing military success of the empire greatly enriched and gave the provincial nobility more power over the peasantry, who were essentially reduced to a state of serfdom.
[109]
Under the Macedonian emperors Constantinople flourished, becoming the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, with a population of approximately 400,000 in the 9th and 10th centuries.
[110]
During this period, the Byzantine Empire employed a strong civil service staffed by competent aristocrats that oversaw the collection of taxes, domestic administration, and foreign policy. The Macedonian emperors also increased the empire's wealth by fostering trade with Western Europe, particularly through
the sale of silk
and metalwork.

included events of momentous religious significance. The conversion of the Bulgarians, Serbs and Rus' to Orthodox Christianity drew the religious map of Europe which still resonates today.
Cyril and Methodius
, two Byzantine Greek brothers from Thessaloniki, contributed significantly to the
Christianisation of the Slavs
and in the process devised the
Glagolitic alphabet
, ancestor to the
Cyrillic script
.
[112]
In 1054, relations between the Eastern and Western traditions of the
Chalcedonian
Christian Church reached a terminal crisis. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation on 16 July, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a
bull
of excommunication on the altar,
[113]
the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation.
[114]
Crisis and fragmentation
The Byzantine Empire fell into a period of difficulties, caused to a large extent by the undermining of the theme system and the neglect of the military. Nikephoros II, John Tzimiskes, and Basil II shifted the emphasis of the military divisions (
τάγματα
,
tagmata
) from a reactive, defence-oriented citizen army into an army of professional career soldiers, increasingly dependent on foreign mercenaries. Mercenaries were expensive, however, and as the threat of invasion receded in the 10th century, so did the need for maintaining large garrisons and expensive fortifications.
[115]
Basil II left a burgeoning treasury upon his death, but he neglected to plan for his succession. None of his immediate successors had any particular military or political talent, and the imperial administration increasingly fell into the hands of the civil service. Incompetent efforts to revive the Byzantine economy resulted in severe inflation and a debased gold currency. The army was seen as both an unnecessary expense and a political threat. A number of standing local units were demobilised, further augmenting the army's dependence on mercenaries, who could be retained and dismissed on an as-needed basis.
[116]

At the same time, Byzantium was faced with new enemies. Its provinces in southern Italy were threatened by the
Normans
who arrived in Italy at the beginning of the 11th century. During a period of strife between Constantinople and Rome culminating in the East-West Schism of 1054, the
Normans advanced slowly but steadily
into Byzantine Italy.

Apulia
, was besieged in August 1068 and

[118]
About 1053,
Constantine IX
disbanded what the historian
John Skylitzes
calls the "Iberian Army", which consisted of 50,000 men, and it was turned into a contemporary
Drungary of the Watch
. Two other knowledgeable contemporaries, the former officials
Michael Attaleiates
and
Kekaumenos
, agree with Skylitzes that by demobilising these soldiers Constantine did catastrophic harm to the empire's eastern defences. The emergency lent weight to the military aristocracy in Anatolia, who in 1068 secured the election of one of their own,
Romanos Diogenes
, as emperor. In the summer of 1071, Romanos undertook a massive eastern campaign to draw the Seljuks into a general engagement with the Byzantine army. At the
Battle of Manzikert
, Romanos suffered a surprise defeat by
Sultan
Alp Arslan
and was captured. Alp Arslan treated him with respect and imposed no harsh terms on the Byzantines.
[116]
In Constantinople, however, a coup put in power
Michael Doukas
, who soon faced the opposition of
Nikephoros Bryennios
and
Nikephoros III Botaneiates
. By 1081, the Seljuks had expanded their rule over virtually the entire Anatolian plateau from Armenia in the east to
Bithynia
in the west, and they had founded their capital at
Nicaea
, just 90 kilometres (56 miles) from Constantinople.
[119]
Komnenian dynasty and the Crusades
See also:
Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty
Alexios I
, founder of the
Komnenos dynasty
After Manzikert, a partial recovery (referred to as the
Komnenian restoration
) was made possible by the
Komnenian dynasty
.
[120]
During the Komnenian period from about 1081 to about 1185, the dynasty presided over a sustained, though ultimately incomplete, restoration of the military, territorial, economic, and political position of the Byzantine Empire.
[121]
Although the Seljuk Turks occupied the heartland of the empire in Anatolia, most Byzantine military efforts during this period were directed against Western powers, particularly the Normans.
[121]
The empire under the Komnenoi played a key role in the history of the
Crusades
in the Holy Land, which Alexios I had helped bring about, while also exerting enormous cultural and political influence in Europe, the
Near East
, and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea under John and Manuel. Contact between Byzantium and the "Latin" West, including the
Crusader states
, increased significantly during the Komnenian period. Venetian and other Italian traders became resident in large numbers in Constantinople and the empire (there were an estimated 60,000 Latins in Constantinople alone, out of a population of three to four hundred thousand), and their presence together with the numerous Latin mercenaries who were employed by Manuel helped to spread Byzantine technology, art, literature and culture throughout the Latin West, while also leading to a flow of Western ideas and customs into the empire.
[122]
Alexios I and the First Crusade
See also:
First Crusade
The
Chora Church
, dating from the
Komnenian period
, has some of the finest Byzantine frescoes and mosaics.
The Komnenoi attained power under
Alexios I
in 1081. From the outset of his reign, Alexios faced a formidable attack by the Normans under Guiscard and his son
Bohemund of Taranto
, who
captured Dyrrhachium
and
Corfu
and laid siege to
Larissa
in
Thessaly
. Guiscard's death in 1085 temporarily eased the Norman problem. The following year, the Seljuq sultan died, and the sultanate was split by internal rivalries. By his own efforts, Alexios defeated the
Pechenegs
, who were caught by surprise and annihilated at the
Battle of Levounion
on 28 April 1091.
[123]
The Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk
Sultanate of Rûm
before the
First Crusade
(1095-1099)
Having achieved stability in the West, Alexios could turn his attention to the severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences.
[124]
However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the
Council of Piacenza
in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to
Pope Urban II
about the suffering of the Christians of the East and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.
[125]
Urban saw Alexios request as a dual opportunity to cement Western Europe and reunite the
Eastern Orthodox Church
with the
Roman Catholic Church
under his rule.
[125]
On 27 November 1095, Urban called the
Council of Clermont
and urged all those present to take up arms under the sign of the
Cross
and launch an armed
pilgrimage
to recover Jerusalem and the East from the Muslims. The response in Western Europe was overwhelming.
[123]
Alexios had anticipated help in the form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of the main body of the Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.
[126]
Alexios was able to recover a number of important cities, islands and much of western Asia Minor. The Crusaders agreed to become Alexios' vassals under the
Treaty of Devol
in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.

, at the end of the
Komnenian period
Alexios's son
John II Komnenos
succeeded him in 1118 and ruled until 1143. John was a pious and dedicated emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert half a century earlier.
[128]
Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm.
[129]
For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine
Marcus Aurelius
. During his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the
Battle of Beroia
.
[130]
He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with
German Emperor
Lothair III
against Norman King
Roger II of Sicily
.
[131]
In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading
numerous campaigns against the Turks
in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the
Danishmend Emirate
of
Melitene
and reconquered all of
Cilicia
, while forcing
Raymond of Poitiers
, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the
Holy Land
at the head of the combined forces of the empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies.
[132]
In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident.
John's chosen heir was his fourth son,
Manuel I Komnenos
, who campaigned aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east. In Palestine, Manuel allied with the Crusader
Kingdom of Jerusalem
and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of
Fatimid Egypt
. Manuel reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with
Raynald
, Prince of Antioch, and
Amalric of Jerusalem
.
[133]
In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to Italy in 1155, but disputes within the coalition led to the eventual failure of the campaign. Despite this military setback, Manuel's armies successfully invaded the southern parts of the
Kingdom of Hungary
in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the
Battle of Sirmium
. By 1168, nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands.
[134]
Manuel made several alliances with the pope and Western Christian kingdoms, and he successfully handled the passage of the crusaders through his empire.
[135]
In the East, however, Manuel suffered a major defeat in 1176 at the
Battle of Myriokephalon
against the Turks. Yet the losses were quickly recovered, and in the following year Manuel's forces inflicted a defeat upon a force of "picked Turks".
[136]
The Byzantine commander
John Vatatzes
, who destroyed the Turkish invaders at the
Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir
, brought troops from the capital and was able to gather an army along the way, a sign that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive programme of western Asia Minor was still successful.

Komnenian
art
John and Manuel pursued active military policies, and both deployed considerable resources on sieges and city defences; aggressive fortification policies were at the heart of their imperial military policies.
[138]
Despite the defeat at Myriokephalon, the policies of Alexios, John and Manuel resulted in vast territorial gains, increased frontier stability in Asia Minor, and secured the stabilisation of the empire's European frontiers. From
c.
1081
to
c.
1180
, the Komnenian army assured the empire's security, enabling Byzantine civilisation to flourish.
[139]
This allowed the Western provinces to achieve an economic revival that continued until the close of the century. It has been argued that Byzantium under the Komnenian rule was more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasions of the 7th century. During the 12th century, population levels rose and extensive tracts of new agricultural land were brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a notable upsurge in new towns. Trade was also flourishing; the Venetians, the
Genoese
and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader states and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with the empire via Constantinople.
[140]
In artistic terms, there was a revival in
mosaic
, and regional schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences.
[141]
During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early
humanism
as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In
Eustathius of Thessalonica
, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression.
[142]
In philosophy, there was a resurgence of classical learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by a significant increase in the publication of commentaries on classical works.
[143]
Besides, the first transmission of classical Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.
[144]
In terms of prosperity and cultural life, the Komnenian period was one of the peaks in Byzantine history,
[145]
and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture.
[146]
There was a renewed interest in
classical Greek philosophy
, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.
[143]
Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the West during this period was enormous and of long-lasting significance.

Main article:
Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty
Byzantium
in the late Angeloi period
Manuel's death on 24 September 1180 left his 11-year-old son
Alexios II Komnenos
on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent in the office, and with his mother
Maria of Antioch
's Frankish background, his regency was unpopular.
[147]
Eventually,
Andronikos I Komnenos
, a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent
coup d'état
.
[148]
Utilising his good looks and his immense popularity with the army, Andronikos marched to Constantinople in August 1182 and incited a
massacre of the Latins
.
[148]
After eliminating his potential rivals, he had himself crowned as co-emperor in September 1183. He eliminated Alexios II and took his 12-year-old wife
Agnes of France
for himself.
[148]
Andronikos began his reign well; in particular, the measures he took to reform the government of the empire have been praised by historians. According to
George Ostrogorsky
, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement.
[149]
The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror.
[150]
Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.
[149]
Despite his military background, Andronikos failed to deal with
Isaac Komnenos
,
Béla III of Hungary
who
reincorporated
Croatian territories into Hungary, and
Stephen Nemanja of Serbia
who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to
William II of Sicily
's invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185 and
sacking Thessalonica
.
[151]
Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, but other than that he was indifferent to the populace. He was finally overthrown when
Isaac II Angelos
, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power with the aid of the people and had Andronikos killed.
[152]
The reign of Isaac II, and more so that of his brother
Alexios III
, saw the collapse of what remained of the centralised machinery of Byzantine government and defence. Although the Normans were driven out of Greece, in 1186 the
Vlachs
and Bulgars began a rebellion that led to the formation of the
Second Bulgarian Empire
. The internal policy of the Angeloi was characterised by the squandering of the public treasure and fiscal maladministration. Imperial authority was severely weakened, and the growing power vacuum at the centre of the empire encouraged fragmentation. There is evidence that some Komnenian heirs had set up a semi-independent state in
Trebizond
before 1204.
[153]
According to
Alexander Vasiliev
, "the dynasty of the Angeloi, Greek in its origin, ... accelerated the ruin of the Empire, already weakened without and disunited within."
[154]
Fourth Crusade and aftermath

In 1198,
Pope Innocent III
broached the subject of a new crusade through
legates
and
encyclical
letters.
[155]
The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer
Egypt
, the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army arrived at
Venice
in the summer of 1202 and hired the Venetian fleet to transport them to Egypt. As a payment to the Venetians, they captured the (Christian) port of
Zara
in
Dalmatia
(vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186).
[156]
Shortly afterwards,
Alexios IV Angelos
, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II, made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade, and provide all the supplies they needed to reach Egypt.
[157]
The partition of the empire following the
Fourth Crusade
,
c.
1204
The crusaders arrived at Constantinople in the summer of 1203 and
quickly attacked
, starting a major fire that damaged large parts of the city, and briefly seized control. Alexios III fled from the capital, and Alexios Angelos was elevated to the throne as Alexios IV along with his blind father Isaac. Alexios IV and Isaac II were unable to keep their promises and were deposed by
Alexios V
. The crusaders again
took the city on 13 April 1204
, and Constantinople was subjected to pillage and massacre by the rank and file for three days. Many priceless icons, relics and other objects later turned up in
Western Europe
, a large number in Venice. According to chronicler
Niketas Choniates
, a prostitute was even set up on the patriarchal throne.
[158]
When order had been restored, the crusaders and the Venetians proceeded to implement their agreement;
Baldwin of Flanders
was elected emperor of a new
Latin Empire
, and the Venetian
Thomas Morosini
was chosen as patriarch. The lands divided up among the leaders included most of the former Byzantine possessions.
[159]
Although Venice was more interested in commerce than conquering territory, it took key areas of Constantinople, and the
Doge
took the title of "
Lord of a Quarter and Half a Quarter of the Roman Empire
".
[160]
After the sack of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine successor states were established: the
Empire of Nicaea
and the
Despotate of Epirus
. A third, the
Empire of Trebizond
, was created after
Alexios
Komnenos
, commanding the
Georgian
expedition in
Chaldia
[161]
a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople, found himself
de facto
emperor and established himself in Trebizond. Of the three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia.
[162]
The weakening of the
Sultanate of Rûm
following the
Mongol invasion in 1242-1243
allowed many
beyliks
and
ghazis
to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor.
[163]
In time, one of the Beys,
Osman I
, created the
Ottoman Empire
that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.
The Byzantine Empire,
c.
1263
The Empire of Nicaea, founded by the
Laskarid dynasty
, managed to effect the
recapture of Constantinople
from the Latins in 1261 and defeat
Epirus
. This led to a short-lived revival of Byzantine fortunes under
Michael VIII Palaiologos
, but the war-ravaged empire was ill-equipped to deal with the enemies that surrounded it. To maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor and levied crippling taxes on the peasantry, causing much resentment.
[164]
Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damage of the Fourth Crusade, but none of these initiatives was of any comfort to the farmers in Asia Minor suffering raids from Muslim ghazis.
[165]
Rather than holding on to his possessions in Asia Minor, Michael chose to expand the empire, gaining only short-term success. To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, he forced the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the peasantry hated Michael and Constantinople.
[165]
The efforts of
Andronikos II
and later his grandson
Andronikos III
marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring the glory of the empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II often backfired, with the
Catalan Company
ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople.

Fall of Constantinople
The
siege of Constantinople
in 1453, depicted in a 15th-century French miniature
The situation became worse for Byzantium during the civil wars after Andronikos III died. A
six-year-long civil war
devastated the empire, allowing the Serbian ruler
Stefan Dušan
to overrun most of the empire's remaining territory and establish a
Serbian Empire
. In 1354, an earthquake at
Gallipoli
devastated the fort, allowing the
Ottomans
(who were hired as mercenaries during the civil war by
John VI Kantakouzenos
) to establish themselves in Europe.
[167]
[168]
By the time the Byzantine civil wars had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals. Following the
Battle of Kosovo
, much of the Balkans became dominated by the Ottomans.
[169]
The Byzantine emperors appealed to the West for help, but the pope would only consider sending aid in return for a reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the
See of Rome
. Church unity was considered and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the
Latin Church
.
[170]
Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.
[171]
Constantinople by this stage was underpopulated and dilapidated. The population of the city had collapsed so severely that it was now little more than a cluster of villages separated by fields. On 2 April 1453,
Sultan Mehmed
's army of 80,000 men and large numbers of irregulars laid siege to the city.
[172]
Despite a desperate last-ditch defence of the city by the massively outnumbered Christian forces (c. 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreign),
[171]
Constantinople finally fell to the Ottomans after a two-month siege on 29 May 1453. The final Byzantine emperor,
Constantine XI Palaiologos
, was last seen casting off his imperial regalia and throwing himself into hand-to-hand combat after the walls of the city were taken.
[173]
Political aftermath

By the time of the fall of Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire, already an empire in name only since the Fourth Crusade, had been reduced to three
rump states
, which were the
Despotate of the Morea
, the Empire of Trebizond and the
Principality of Theodoro
. The Morea was ruled by the brothers of Constantine XI,
Thomas Palaiologos
and
Demetrios Palaiologos
. The despotate continued as an independent state by paying an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute, and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460.
[174]
A few holdouts remained for a time. The island of
Monemvasia
refused to surrender, and it was ruled for a short time by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to place themselves under the pope's protection before the end of 1460. The
Mani Peninsula
, on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea's northwest.
Graitzas Palaiologos
was the military commander there, stationed at
Salmeniko Castle
. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.
[175]
The Empire of Trebizond, which had split away from the Byzantine Empire just weeks before Constantinople was taken by the Crusaders in 1204, became the last remnant and last de facto successor state to the Byzantine Empire. Efforts by Emperor
David
to recruit European powers for an anti-Ottoman crusade provoked war between the Ottomans and Trebizond in the summer of 1461. After a
month-long siege
, David surrendered the city of Trebizond on 14 August 1461. Trebizond's Crimean principality, the
Principality of Theodoro
(part of the
Perateia
), lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in December 1475. Therefore, the last territorial remnant of the Roman Empire had officially ceased to exist, after 2,228 years of Roman civilization, since the legendary
Founding of Rome
in 753 BC.
A nephew of the last emperor, Constantine XI,
Andreas Palaiologos
claimed to have inherited the title of Byzantine emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived under the protection of the
Papal States
for the remainder of his life. Since the office of the emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself
Imperator Constantinopolitanus
("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both
Charles VIII of France
and the
Catholic Monarchs
.
Constantine XI died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he might have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed
Has Murad
, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as
beylerbey
(governor-general) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed
Mesih Pasha
, became admiral of the Ottoman fleet and
sanjak-bey
(governor) of the Province of
Gallipoli
. He eventually served twice as
grand vizier
under Mehmed's son,
Bayezid II
.
[176]
Mehmed II and his successors continued to
consider themselves heirs
to the Roman Empire. They considered that they had shifted their religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (
Orthodox Christians
) as
Rûm
. However, this claim gradually faded away, as the Ottoman Empire assumed a more Islamic political identity.
[177]
Meanwhile, the
Danubian Principalities
(whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors
[178]
) harbored Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.
At Constantine's death, the role of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by
Ivan III
, Grand Prince of
Muscovy
. He had married Andreas' sister,
Sophia Palaiologina
, whose grandson,
Ivan IV
, would become the first tsar of Russia (
tsar
, or
czar
, meaning
caesar
, is a term traditionally applied by Slavs to the Byzantine emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the
Russian Empire
as the successive
Third Rome
was kept alive until its demise with the
Russian Revolution
.
[179]
Government and bureaucracy

Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy
The

The
themes
,
c.
950
Largely based on Emperor
Diocletian
's
Dominate
reforms in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries, the
monarch
was the sole and
absolute ruler
, and his power was regarded as having divine origin.
[180]
[181]
From Justinian I on, the emperor was considered
nomos empsychos
, the "living law", both lawgiver and administrator.
[182]
The
senate
had ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members, resembling an emergency or ceremonial meeting made up of powerful Constantinopolitan aristocrats, very often friends and relatives of the emperor. By the end of the 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of
sakellarios
is related to this change).
[183]
As a result of the different Orthodox and
Hellenistic political
philosophies, from Justinian onwards, an administrative simplification was given way for the emperor's easier management of the state as the sole administrator and lawgiver of the sacred
Oikoumene
.
[184]
Definitive powers began to be attached around single entities who acted as
viceroys
, starting with the
exarchs
and their Justinianic-era predecessors
stratelates
who shared the extraordinary powers of the emperor in their respective districts and only answered to him, they also being appointed by the sovereign directly. The most important administrative reform, which probably started in the mid-7th century, was the creation of
themes
, where civil and military administration were embodied in a single person, the
strategos
,
who, as the emperor's viceroy, shared his extraordinary powers in their respective "
thémata
", they too being also appointed by the emperor alone.
[185]
[186]
Despite the occasionally derogatory use of the terms "Byzantine" and "
Byzantinism
", the Byzantine bureaucracy had a distinct ability for adapting to the empire's changing situations. The elaborate system of titulature and precedence gave the court prestige and influence. Officials were arranged in strict order around the emperor and depended upon the royal will for their ranks. There were also actual administrative jobs, but authority could be vested in individuals rather than offices.
[187]
In the 8th and 9th centuries, civil service had constituted the clearest path to aristocratic status. However, beginning from the 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivalled by an aristocracy of nobility. According to some studies of the Byzantine government, 11th-century politics were dominated by competition between the civil and the military aristocracy. During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including the creation of new courtly dignities and offices.
[188]

Foreign relations of the Byzantine Empire
The embassy of

and the Abbasid caliph

After the fall of Rome, the key challenge to the empire was maintaining relations with its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they were often modelled after Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations.
[189]
This network revolved around treaty-making and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions.
[190]
Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy as a form of war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.
[191]
Italian sketch of Emperor
John VIII

Ferrara
and

Diplomacy was understood to have an intelligence-gathering function on top of its pure political function. The
Bureau of Barbarians
in Constantinople handled matters of protocol and record-keeping for any issues related to the "
barbarians
", and thus had, perhaps, a basic intelligence function itself.
[192]
John B. Bury
believes that the office exercised supervision over all foreigners visiting Constantinople, and that they were under the supervision of the
Logothetes tou dromou
.
[193]
While on the surface a protocol office—its main duty was to ensure foreign envoys were properly cared for and received sufficient state funds for their maintenance, and it kept all the official translators—it probably had a security function as well.
[194]
Byzantines availed themselves of several diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to the capital often stayed on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople as a potential hostage as well as a useful pawn in case political conditions changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays.
[189]
According to
Dimitri Obolensky
, the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe could be accredited to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.
[195]
Law
Main article:
Byzantine law
In 438, the
Codex Theodosianus
, named after Theodosius II, codified Byzantine law. It went into force in the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire as well as in the Western Roman Empire. It summarised the laws and gave direction on interpretation. Under the reign of Justinian I it was
Tribonian
, a notable jurist, who supervised the revision of the legal code known today as the
Corpus Juris Civilis
. Justinian's reforms had a clear effect on the evolution of
jurisprudence
, with his
Corpus
becoming the basis for
revived Roman law
in the Western world, while Leo III's
Ecloga
influenced the formation of legal institutions in the Slavic world.
[196]
In the 10th century, Leo VI the Wise achieved the complete codification of the whole of Byzantine law in Greek with the
Basilika
, which became the foundation of all subsequent Byzantine law codes with an influence extending through to modern Balkan legal codes.

Many of the most distinguished classical scholars held high office in the
Eastern Orthodox Church
.
[199]
The
Imperial University of Constantinople
, sometimes known as the
University of the Palace Hall of Magnaura
(
Greek
:
Πανδιδακτήριον τῆς Μαγναύρας
), was an
Eastern Roman
educational institution that could trace its corporate origins to AD 425, when Emperor Theodosius II founded the
Pandidakterion
(
Medieval Greek
:
Πανδιδακτήριον
).
[200]
The Pandidakterion was refounded in 1046
[201]
by
Constantine IX Monomachos
who created the Departments of Law (Διδασκαλεῖον τῶν Νόμων) and Philosophy (Γυμνάσιον).
[202]
At the time various economic schools, colleges, polytechnics, libraries and fine arts academies also operated in the city of Constantinople. And a few scholars have gone so far as to call the Pandidakterion the first "university" in the world.
[203]
The writings of
classical antiquity
were cultivated and preserved in Byzantium. Therefore, Byzantine science was in every period closely connected with
ancient philosophy
, and
metaphysics
.
[204]
In the field of engineering
Isidore of Miletus
, the Greek mathematician and architect of the Hagia Sophia, produced the first compilation of
Archimedes
' works
c.
530
, and it is through this manuscript tradition, kept alive by the school of mathematics and engineering founded
c.
850
during the "Byzantine Renaissance" by
Leo the Mathematician
, that such works are known today (see
Archimedes Palimpsest
).
[205]
Alexandrian philosopher
John Philoponus
was the first to question
Aristotelian physics
. Unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation. Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics was an inspiration for
Galileo Galilei
's refutation of Aristotelian physics during the
Scientific Revolution
many centuries later, as Galileo cites Philoponus substantially in his works.
[206]
[207]
The Byzantines pioneered the concept of the hospital as an institution offering medical care and the possibility of a cure for the patients, as a reflection of the ideals of Christian charity, rather than merely a place to die.
[208]

Greek fire, an incendiary weapon which could even burn on water, is attributed to the Byzantines. It played a crucial role in the empire's victory over the Umayyad Caliphate during the siege of Constantinople (717-718).
[209]
The discovery is attributed to
Callinicus of Heliopolis
from Syria who fled during the Arab conquest of Syria. However, it has also been argued that no single person invented Greek fire, but rather, that it was "invented by the chemists in Constantinople who had inherited the discoveries of the Alexandrian chemical school...".
[210]
In the final century of the empire,
astronomy
and other
mathematical sciences
were taught in Trebizond; medicine attracted the interest of almost all scholars.
[211]
The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 fuelled the era later commonly known as the "
Italian Renaissance
". During this period,
refugee Byzantine scholars
were principally responsible for carrying, in person and writing, ancient Greek grammatical, literary studies, mathematical, and astronomical knowledge to early Renaissance Italy.
[212]
They also brought with them classical learning and texts on botany, medicine and zoology, as well as the works of Dioscorides and John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian physics.

The Byzantine Empire was a
theocracy
, said to be ruled by
God
working through the emperor. Jennifer Fretland VanVoorst argues, "The Byzantine Empire became a theocracy in the sense that Christian values and ideals were the foundation of the empire's political ideals and heavily entwined with its political goals."
[213]
Steven Runciman says in his book:
The constitution of the Byzantine Empire was based on the conviction that it was the earthly copy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Just as God ruled in Heaven, so the Emperor, made in his image, should rule on earth and carry out his commandments ... It saw itself as a universal empire. Ideally, it should embrace all the peoples of the Earth who, ideally, should all be members of the one true Christian Church, its own Orthodox Church. Just as man was made in God's image, so man's kingdom on Earth was made in the image of the Kingdom of Heaven.
[214]
The survival of the empire in the East assured an active role of the emperor in the affairs of the Church. The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative and financial routine of administering religious affairs, and this routine was applied to the
Christian Church
. Following the pattern set by
Eusebius
of Caesarea, the Byzantines viewed the emperor as a representative or messenger of
Christ
, responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans, and for the "externals" of the religion, such as administration and finances. As
Cyril Mango
points out, the Byzantine political thinking can be summarised in the motto "One God, one empire, one religion".
[215]
Constantinople is generally considered the "cradle of Orthodox
Christian civilization
".
[216]
The imperial role in the affairs of the Church never developed into a fixed, legally defined system.
[217]
Additionally, the decline of Rome and the internal dissension in the other Eastern patriarchates, made the Church of Constantinople, between the 6th and 11th centuries, the richest and most influential centre of
Christendom
.
[218]
Even when the empire was reduced to only a shadow of its former self, the Church continued to exercise significant influence both inside and outside of the imperial frontiers. As
George Ostrogorsky
points out:
The
Patriarchate of Constantinople
remained the centre of the Orthodox world, with subordinate
metropolitan sees
and archbishoprics in the territory of Asia Minor and the Balkans, now lost to Byzantium, as well as in
Caucasus
, Russia and Lithuania. The Church remained the most stable element in the Byzantine Empire.
[219]
Byzantine monasticism especially came to be an "ever-present feature" of the empire, with monasteries becoming "powerful landowners and a voice to be listened to in imperial politics".
[220]
The official state Christian doctrine was determined by the
first seven ecumenical councils
, and it was then the emperor's duty to impose it on his subjects. An imperial decree of 388, which was later incorporated into the
Codex Justinianeus
, orders the population of the empire "to assume the name of Catholic Christians", and regards all those who will not abide by the law as "mad and foolish persons"; as followers of "heretical dogmas".
[221]
Despite imperial decrees and the stringent stance of the
state church
, which came to be known as the Eastern Orthodox Church or
Eastern Christianity
, the Eastern Orthodox Church never represented all Christians in Byzantium. Mango believes that in the early stages of the empire, the "mad and foolish persons"—those labelled "
heretics
" by the state church—were the majority of the population.
[222]
Besides the
pagans
who existed until the end of the 6th century, and the
Jews
, there were many followers—sometimes even emperors—of various Christian doctrines, such as
Nestorianism
,
Monophysitism
,
Arianism
, and
Paulicianism
, whose teachings were in some opposition to the main theological doctrine as determined by the Ecumenical Councils.
[223]
Another division among Christians occurred, when Leo III ordered the destruction of icons throughout the empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in the mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, a new wave of pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually
Christianised
, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what remained of the empire.
[224]
Jews were a significant minority in the Byzantine state throughout its history, and according to Roman law, they constituted a legally recognised religious group. In the early Byzantine period they were generally tolerated, but then periods of tensions and persecutions ensued. In any case, after the Arab conquests the majority of Jews found themselves outside the empire; those left inside the Byzantine borders apparently lived in relative peace from the 10th century onwards.

Surviving
Byzantine art
is mostly religious and with exceptions at certain periods is highly conventionalised, following traditional models that translate carefully controlled church theology into artistic terms. Painting in
fresco
,
illuminated manuscripts
and on wood panel and, especially in earlier periods, mosaic were the main media, and figurative
sculpture
very rare except for small
carved ivories
. Manuscript painting preserved to the end some of the classical realist tradition that was missing in larger works.
[226]
Byzantine art was highly prestigious and sought-after in Western Europe, where it maintained a continuous influence on
medieval art
until near the end of the period. This was especially so in Italy, where Byzantine styles persisted in modified form through the 12th century, and became formative influences on
Italian Renaissance
art. But few incoming influences affected the Byzantine style. With the expansion of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Byzantine forms and styles spread throughout the Orthodox world and beyond.
[227]
Influences from
Byzantine architecture
, particularly in religious buildings, can be found in diverse regions from Egypt and Arabia to
Russia
and Romania. Byzantine architecture is known for the use of
domes
, and
pendentive
architecture was invented in the Byzantine Empire. It also often featured marble columns,
coffered
ceilings and sumptuous decoration, including the extensive use of
mosaics
with golden backgrounds. The building material used by Byzantine architects was no longer marble, which was very appreciated by the Ancient Greeks. They used mostly stone and brick, and also thin
alabaster
sheets for windows. Mosaics were used to cover brick walls, and any other surface where fresco would not resist. Good examples of mosaics from the proto-Byzantine era are in
Hagios Demetrios
in
Thessaloniki
(Greece), the
Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo
and the
Basilica of San Vitale
, both in Ravenna (Italy), and Hagia Sophia in
Istanbul
. Christian liturgies were held in the interior of the churches, the exterior usually having little to no ornamentation.

Literature
See also:
Byzantine literature
In
Byzantine literature
, three different cultural elements are recognised: the
Greek
, the Christian, and the
Oriental
. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists; encyclopaedists (
Patriarch Photios
,
Michael Psellus
, and
Michael Choniates
are regarded as the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists; writers of secular poetry (the only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the
Digenis Acritas
);
ecclesiastical and theological literature; and popular poetry.
[233]
Of the 2,000 to 3,000 volumes of Byzantine literature that survive, only 330 consist of secular poetry, history, science and pseudo-science.
[233]
While the most flourishing period of the secular literature of Byzantium runs from the 9th to the 12th century, its religious literature (
sermons
,
liturgical books
and poetry, theology, devotional treatises, etc.) developed much earlier with
Romanos the Melodist
being its most prominent representative.

The ecclesiastical forms of
Byzantine music
—composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music
[236]
—are today the most well-known forms. Ecclesiastical chants were a fundamental part of this genre. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the
ancient Greek system
.
[237]
It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.
Earliest known depiction of a
bowed lyra
, from a Byzantine ivory casket (900-1100) (
Museo Nazionale, Florence
)
The 9th-century Persian geographer
Ibn Khordadbeh
, in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, cited the
lyra
(lūrā) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the
urghun
(organ),
shilyani
(probably a type of
harp
or
lyre
) and the
salandj
(probably a
bagpipe
).
[238]
The first of these, the early bowed stringed instrument known as the Byzantine lyra, came to be called the
lira da braccio
,
[239]
in Venice, where it is considered by many to have been the predecessor of the contemporary violin, which later flourished there.
[240]
The bowed "lyra" is still played in former Byzantine regions, where it is known as the
Politiki lyra
(
lit.
'lyra of the City', i.e. Constantinople) in Greece, the
Calabrian lira
in southern Italy, and the
lijerica
in Dalmatia. The
water organ
originated in the Hellenistic world and was used in the
Hippodrome
during races.
[241]
[242]
A
pipe organ
with "great leaden pipes" was sent by Emperor Constantine V to
Pepin the Short
,
King of the Franks
in 757. Pepin's son
Charlemagne
requested a similar organ for his chapel in
Aachen
in 812, beginning its establishment in Western church music.
[242]
The
aulos
was a double-reeded woodwind like the modern
oboe
or Armenian
duduk
. Other forms include the
plagiaulos
(
πλαγίαυλος
, from
πλάγιος
"sideways"), which resembled the
flute
,
[243]
and the
askaulos
(ἀσκός
askos
-
wineskin
), a bagpipe.
[244]
Bagpipes, also known as
dankiyo
(from ancient Greek: angion (Τὸ ἀγγεῖον) "the container"), had been played even in Roman times and continued to be played throughout the empire's former realms through to the present. (See Balkan
Gaida
, Greek
Tsampouna
,

Tulum
, Cretan
Askomandoura
, Armenian
Parkapzuk
, and Romanian

.) The modern descendant of the aulos is the Greek

. Other instruments used in Byzantine music were the
Kanonaki
,
Oud
,
Laouto
,
Santouri
,
Tambouras
, Seistron (defi tambourine),

may have been invented by the Byzantines before the arrival of the Turks.

Cuisine

Byzantine cuisine
Byzantine culture was initially the same as Late Greco-Roman, but over the following millennium of the empire's existence it slowly changed into something more similar to modern Balkan and Anatolian culture. The cuisine still relied heavily on the Greco-Roman fish-sauce condiment
garos
, but it also contained foods still familiar today, such as the cured meat
pastirma
(known as "paston" in Byzantine Greek),
[245]
[246]
[247]
baklava
(known as
koptoplakous
κοπτοπλακοῦς),
[248]
tiropita
(known as plakountas tetyromenous or tyritas plakountas),
[249]
and the famed medieval sweet wines (
Malvasia
from
Monemvasia
,
Commandaria
and the eponymous
Rumney wine
).
Retsina
, wine flavoured with pine resin, was also drunk, as it still is in Greece today, producing similar reactions from unfamiliar visitors; "To add to our calamity the Greek wine, on account of being mixed with pitch, resin, and plaster was to us undrinkable," complained
Liutprand of Cremona
, who was the ambassador sent to Constantinople in 968 by the German Holy Roman Emperor
Otto I
.
[250]
The garos fish sauce condiment was also not much appreciated by the unaccustomed; Liutprand of Cremona described being served food covered in an "exceedingly bad fish liquor."
[250]
The Byzantines also used a soy sauce-like condiment,
murri
, a fermented barley sauce, which, like soy sauce, provided
umami
flavouring to their dishes.

in the West European sense. Various emblems (
Greek
:

,
sēmeia
; sing. σημείον,
sēmeion
) were used in official occasions and for military purposes, such as banners or shields displaying various motifs such as the
cross
or the
labarum
. The use of the cross and images of
Christ
, the
Virgin Mary
and various saints is also
attested on seals
of officials, but these were personal rather than family emblems.

Apart from the Imperial court, administration and military, the primary language used in the eastern Roman provinces even before the decline of the Western Empire was Greek, having been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin.
[255]
Following Rome's conquest of the east its 'Pax Romana', inclusionist political practices and development of public infrastructure, facilitated the further spreading and entrenchment of the Greek language in the east. Indeed, early on in the life of the Roman Empire, Greek had become the common language of the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and to a large degree the
lingua franca
for trade between provinces and with other nations.
[256]
Greek for a time became
diglossic
with the spoken language, known as
Koine
(eventually evolving into
Demotic Greek
), used alongside an older written form (
Attic Greek
) until
Koine
won out as the spoken and written standard.
[257]
The Emperor
Diocletian
sought to renew the authority of Latin, making it the official language of the Roman administration also in the East, and the Greek expression ἡ κρατοῦσα διάλεκτος
(hē kratousa dialektos)
attests to the status of Latin as "the language of power."
[258]
In the early 5th century, Greek gained equal status with Latin as the official language in the East, and emperors gradually began to legislate in Greek rather than Latin starting with the reign of Leo I the Thracian in the 460s.
[42]
The last Eastern emperor to stress the importance of Latin was Justinian I, whose
Corpus Juris Civilis
was written almost entirely in Latin. He may also have been the last native Latin-speaking emperor.
[42]
The use of Latin as the language of administration persisted for centuries, though it was increasingly replaced by Greek. Scholarly Latin rapidly fell into disuse among the educated classes although the language continued to be at least a ceremonial part of the empire's culture for some time.
[259]
Additionally, Latin remained a minority language in the empire, mainly on the Italian peninsula, along the Dalmatian coast and in the Balkans (specially in mountainous areas away from the coast), eventually developing into various
Romance languages
like
Dalmatian
or
Romanian
.
[260]
Many other languages existed in the empire, and some of these were given limited official status in their provinces at various times.
[261]
Notably, by the beginning of the Middle Ages,
Syriac
had become more widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces.
[262]
Similarly,
Armenian
, and
Georgian
became significant among the educated in their provinces.
[263]
Later foreign contacts made
Old Church Slavonic
,
Persian
, and
Arabic
important in parts of the empire.
[264]
There was a revival of Latin studies in the 10th century due to increased contacts with Western Europe, and by the 11th century knowledge of Latin was no longer unusual at Constantinople.
[265]
There was widespread use of the Armenian and various Slavic languages, which became more pronounced in the border regions of the empire.
[261]
Various other languages were spoken in the empire by foreign merchants, mercenaries, pilgrims, dignitaries, and others.
[266]
As the empire entered its final decline, the non-Greek speaking regions were lost, and the presence of foreigners diminished, making the empire increasingly homogeneously Greek speaking.
[267]
Recreation
A game of
τάβλι (tabula)
played by
Byzantine
emperor
Zeno
in 480 and recorded by
Agathias
in
c.
530
because of a very unlucky dice throw for Zeno (red), as he threw 2, 5 and 6 and was forced to leave eight pieces alone.
[268]
Byzantines were avid players of
tavli
(
Byzantine Greek
: τάβλη), a game known in English as
backgammon
, which is still popular in former Byzantine realms and still known by the name tavli in Greece.
[268]
Byzantine nobles were devoted to horsemanship, particularly
tzykanion
, now known as
polo
. The game came from Sassanid Persia, and a Tzykanisterion (stadium for playing the game) was built by Theodosius II inside the
Great Palace of Constantinople
. Emperor Basil I excelled at it; Emperor Alexander died from exhaustion while playing, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos was injured while playing with
Tatikios
, and John I of Trebizond died from a fatal injury during a game.
[269]
[270]
Aside from Constantinople and Trebizond, other Byzantine cities also featured
tzykanisteria
, most notably
Sparta
,
Ephesus
, and
Athens
, an indication of a thriving urban aristocracy.
[271]
The game was introduced to the West by crusaders, who developed a taste for it particularly during the pro-Western reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Chariot races were popular and held at hippodromes across the empire. There were initially four major factions in chariot racing, differentiated by the colour of the uniform in which they competed; the colours were also
worn
by their supporters. These were the Blues (
Veneti
), the Greens (
Prasini
), the Reds (
Russati
), and the Whites (
Albati
), although by the Byzantine era the only teams with any influence were the Blues and Greens. Emperor Justinian I was a supporter of the Blues.

Women in the Byzantine Empire
The position of
women in the Byzantine Empire
essentially represents the position of women in ancient Rome transformed by the introduction of Christianity, with certain rights and customs being lost and replaced, while others were allowed to remain. There were individual Byzantine women famed for their educational accomplishments. However, the general view of women's education was that it was sufficient for a girl to learn domestic duties and to study the lives of the Christian saints and memorize psalms,
[272]
and to learn to read so that she could study Bible scriptures—although literacy in women was sometimes discouraged because it was believed it could encourage vice.
[273]
The Roman right to divorce was gradually erased after the introduction of Christianity and replaced with legal separation and annulment. Marriage was regarded as the ideal state for a woman, and only convent life was seen as a legitimate alternative. Within marriage, sexual activity was regarded only as a means of reproduction. Women had the right to appear before court, but her testimony was not regarded as equal to that of a man and could be contradicted based on her sex if put against that of a man.
[272]
From the 6th century there was a growing ideal of
gender segregation
, which dictated that women should wear veils
[274]
and only be seen in public when attending church,
[275]
and while the ideal was never fully enforced, it influenced society. The laws of Emperor Justinian I made it legal for a man to divorce his wife for attending public premises such as theatres or public baths without his permission,
[276]
and Emperor Leo VI banned women from witnessing business contracts with the argument that it caused them to come in contact with men.
[272]
In Constantinople, upper-class women were increasingly expected to keep to a special women's section (
gynaikonitis
),
[275]
and by the 8th century it was described as unacceptable for unmarried daughters to meet unrelated men.
[272]
While imperial women and their ladies appeared in public alongside men, women and men at the imperial court attended royal banquets separately until the rise of the Komnenos dynasty in the 12th century.
[275]
Eastern Roman and later Byzantine women retained the Roman woman's right to inherit, own and manage their property and signs contracts,
[275]
rights which were far superior to the rights of married women in Medieval Catholic Western Europe, as these rights included both married women as well as unmarried women and widows.
[276]
Women's legal right to handle their own money made it possible for rich women to engage in business, however women who actively had to find a profession to support themselves normally worked as domestics or in domestic fields such as the food or textile industry.
[276]
Women could work as medical physicians and attendants of women patients and visitors at hospitals and public baths with government support.
[273]
After the introduction of Christianity, women could no longer become priestesses, but it became common for women to found and manage nunneries, which functioned as schools for girls as well as asylums, poor houses, hospitals, prisons and retirement homes for women, and many Byzantine women practised social work as lay sisters and deaconesses.

The
Byzantine economy
was among the most advanced in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine economic strength until late in the Middle Ages. Constantinople operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of
Eurasia
and
North Africa
, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous
Silk Road
. Until the first half of the 6th century and in sharp contrast with the decaying West, the Byzantine economy was flourishing and resilient.
[277]
The
Plague of Justinian
and the Arab conquests represented a substantial reversal of fortunes contributing to a period of stagnation and decline. Isaurian reforms and Constantine V's repopulation, public works and tax measures marked the beginning of a revival that continued until 1204, despite territorial contraction.
[278]
From the 10th century until the end of the 12th, the Byzantine Empire projected an image of luxury and travellers were impressed by the wealth accumulated in the capital.
[279]
The Fourth Crusade resulted in the disruption of Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial dominance of the Western Europeans in the
eastern Mediterranean
, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the empire.
[279]
The
Palaiologoi
tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state did not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, Constantinople also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.
[280]
One of the economic foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the empire. Textiles must have been by far the most important item of export;
silks
were certainly imported into Egypt and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West.
[281]
The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the monopoly of issuing
coinage
, maintaining a durable and flexible monetary system adaptable to trade needs.
[282]
The government attempted to exercise formal control over interest rates and set the parameters for the activity of the
guilds
and
corporations
, in which it had a special interest. The emperor and his officials intervened at times of crisis to ensure the provisioning of the capital, and to keep down the price of cereals. Finally, the government often collected part of the surplus through taxation, and put it back into circulation, through redistribution in the form of salaries to state officials, or in the form of investment in public works.

Byzantium has been often identified with absolutism, orthodox spirituality, orientalism and exoticism, while the terms "Byzantine" and "Byzantinism" have been used as bywords for decadence, complex bureaucracy, and repression. Both Eastern and Western European authors have often perceived Byzantium as a body of religious, political, and philosophical ideas contrary to those of the West. Even in
19th-century Greece
, the focus was mainly on the classical past, while Byzantine tradition had been associated with negative connotations.
[283]
This traditional approach towards Byzantium has been partially or wholly disputed and revised by modern studies, which focus on the positive aspects of Byzantine culture and legacy.
Averil Cameron
regards as undeniable the Byzantine contribution to the formation of medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history, societies and culture of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries.
[284]
The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of classical knowledge, as important contributors to modern European civilisation, and as precursors of both
Renaissance humanism
and Slavic-Orthodox culture.
[285]
Some scholars focused on the positive aspects of Byzantine culture and legacy, French historian
Charles Diehl
describes the Byzantine Empire by saying:
Byzantium created a brilliant culture, may be, the most brilliant during the whole Middle Ages, doubtlessly the only one existing in Christian Europe before the XI century. For many years, Constantinople remained the sole grand city of Christian Europe ranking second to none in splendour. Byzantium literature and art exerted a significant impact on peoples around it. The monuments and majestic works of art, remaining after it, show us the whole lustre of byzantine culture. That's why Byzantium held a significant place in the history of Middle Ages and, one must admit it, a merited one.
[286]
As the only stable long-term state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging forces to the East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were directly related to the respective progress of Islam.
[285]
Following the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II took the title "
Kaysar-i Rûm
" (the Ottoman Turkish equivalent of
Caesar
of Rome), since he was determined to make the Ottoman Empire the heir of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Protected section of code that cannot be executed by more than one process at a time
In
concurrent programming
, concurrent accesses to
shared resources
can lead to unexpected or erroneous behavior, so parts of the program where the shared resource is accessed need to be protected in ways that avoid the concurrent access. One way to do so is known as a
critical section
or
critical region
. This protected section cannot be entered  by more than one process or thread at a time; others are suspended until the first leaves the critical section. Typically, the critical section accesses a shared resource, such as a
data structure
, a peripheral device, or a network connection, that would not operate correctly in the context of multiple concurrent accesses.
[1]
Need for critical sections
[
edit
]
Different codes or processes may consist of the same variable or other resources that need to be read or written but whose results depend on the order in which the actions occur. For example, if a variable
x
is to be read by process A, and process B has to write to the same variable
x
at the same time, process A might get either the old or new value of
x
.
Flow graph depicting need for critical section
Process A:
// Process A
.
.
b
=
x
+
5
;
// instruction executes at time = Tx
.
Process B:
// Process B
.
.
x
=
3
+
z
;
// instruction executes at time = Tx
.
In cases where a
locking
mechanism with finer granularity is not needed, a critical section is important. In the above case, if A needs to read the updated value of
x
, executing process A, and process B at the same time may not give required results. To prevent this, variable
x
is protected by a critical section. First, B gets the access to the section. Once B finishes writing the value, A gets the access to the critical section, and variable
x
can be read.
By carefully controlling which variables are modified inside and outside the critical section, concurrent access to the shared variable are prevented. A critical section is typically used when a multi-threaded program must update multiple related variables without a separate thread making conflicting changes to that data. In a related situation, a critical section may be used to ensure that a shared resource, for example, a printer, can only be accessed by one process at a time.
Implementation of critical sections
[
edit
]
The implementation of critical sections vary among different operating systems.
A critical section will usually terminate in finite time,
[2]
and a thread, task, or process will have to wait for a fixed time to enter it (
bounded waiting
). To ensure exclusive use of critical sections some  synchronization mechanism is required at the entry and exit of the program.
Critical section is a piece of a program that requires
mutual exclusion
of access.
Locks and critical sections in multiple threads
As shown in the figure,
[3]
in the case of mutual exclusion (
mutex
), one thread blocks a critical section by using locking techniques when it needs to access the shared resource, and other threads have to wait to get their turn to enter into the section. This prevents conflicts when two or more threads share the same memory space and want to access a common resource.
[2]
Pseudocode for implementing critical section
The simplest method to prevent any change of processor control inside the critical section is implementing a semaphore. In uniprocessor systems, this can be done by disabling interrupts on entry into the critical section, avoiding system calls that can cause a
context switch
while inside the section, and restoring interrupts to their previous state on exit. Any thread of execution entering any critical section anywhere in the system will, with this implementation, prevent any other thread, including an interrupt, from being granted processing time on the CPU—and therefore from entering any other critical section or, indeed, any code whatsoever—until the original thread leaves its critical section.
This brute-force approach can be improved upon by using
semaphores
. To enter a critical section, a thread must obtain a semaphore, which it releases on leaving the section. Other threads are prevented from entering the critical section at the same time as the original thread, but are free to gain control of the CPU and execute other code, including other critical sections that are protected by different semaphores. Semaphore locking also has a time limit to prevent a deadlock condition in which a lock is acquired by a single process for an infinite time, stalling the other processes that need to use the shared resource protected by the critical section.
Uses of critical sections
[
edit
]
Kernel-level critical sections
[
edit
]
Typically, critical sections prevent thread and
process migration
between processors and the
preemption
of processes and threads by interrupts and other processes and threads.
Critical sections often allow nesting. Nesting allows multiple critical sections to be entered and exited at little cost.
If the
scheduler
interrupts the current process or thread in a critical section, the scheduler will either allow the currently executing process or thread to run to completion of the critical section, or it will schedule the process or thread for another complete quantum. The scheduler will not migrate the process or thread to another processor, and it will not schedule another process or thread to run while the current process or thread is in a critical section.
Similarly, if an
interrupt
occurs in a critical section, the interrupt information is recorded for future processing, and execution is returned to the process or thread in the critical section.
[4]
Once the critical section is exited, and in some cases the scheduled quantum completed, the pending interrupt will be executed. The concept of scheduling quantum applies to "
round-robin
" and similar
scheduling policies
.
Since critical sections may
execute
only on the processor on which they are entered, synchronization is only required within the executing processor. This allows critical sections to be entered and exited at almost zero cost. No inter-processor synchronization is required. Only instruction stream synchronization
[5]
is needed. Most processors provide the required amount of synchronization by the simple act of interrupting the current execution state. This allows critical sections in most cases to be nothing more than a per processor count of critical sections entered.
Performance enhancements include executing pending interrupts at the exit of all critical sections and allowing the scheduler to run at the exit of all critical sections. Furthermore, pending interrupts may be transferred to other processors for execution.
Critical sections should not be used as a long-lasting locking primitive. Critical sections should be kept short enough so that it can be entered, executed, and exited without any interrupts occurring from the
hardware
and the scheduler.
Kernel-level critical sections are the base of the
software lockout
issue.
Critical sections in data structures
[
edit
]
In parallel programming, the code is divided into threads. The
read-write conflicting
variables are split between threads and each thread has a copy of them. Data structures like
linked lists
,
trees
,
hash tables
etc. have data variables that are linked and cannot be split between threads and hence implementing parallelism is very difficult.
[6]
To improve the efficiency of implementing data structures multiple operations like insertion, deletion, search need to be executed in parallel. While performing these operations, there may be scenarios where the same element is being searched by one thread and is being deleted by another. In such cases, the output may be
erroneous
. The thread searching the element may have a hit, whereas the other thread may delete it just after that time. These scenarios will cause issues in the program running by providing false data. To prevent this, one method is that the entire data-structure can be kept under critical section so that only one operation is handled at a time. Another method is locking the node in use under critical section, so that other operations do not use the same node. Using critical section, thus, ensures that the code provides expected outputs.
[6]
Critical sections in relation to peripherals
[
edit
]
Critical sections also occur in code which manipulates external peripherals, such as I/O devices. The registers of a peripheral must be programmed with certain values in a certain sequence; if two or more processes control a device simultaneously, incorrect behavior will ensue: neither process will have the device in the state which it requires.
When a complex unit of information must be produced on an output device by issuing multiple output operations, exclusive access is required so that another process doesn't corrupt the datum by interleaving its own bits of output.
In the input direction, exclusive access is required when reading a complex datum via multiple separate input operations, to prevent another process from consuming some of the pieces, causing corruption.
Storage devices provide a form of memory; the concept of critical sections is equally relevant in the same manner as it is to shared data structures in main memory. A process which performs multiple access or update operations on a file is executing a critical section that must be guarded with an appropriate file locking mechanism.

A police station of the River Police
[1]
The
River Tyne Police
was a
police
force established under the Newcastle upon Tyne Port Act 1845 which patrolled the
River Tyne
in
England
between 1845 and 1968.
History
[
edit
]
Establishment
[
edit
]
The first attempt to establish a police force the river was made in May 1821, when a River Committee of the Common Council (of the
Corporation of Newcastle
) were requested by a group from
coal merchants
& ship owners from
North Shields
,
South Shields
and
Newcastle
to form a police force to prevent crime on the river. The Committee appointed a Superintendent, who identified 11 men to be sworn in as
special constables
on a trial basis, for a period of three months from June 1821. The Committee also ordered four boats for the men to use.
[2]
It seems that this effort was not entirely successful: by 1844, ship owners repeated the request. Speaking during a meeting of the Council in February 1845, Councillor Rayne said: "Twenty years ago this river police was tried at a considerable expense, he believed not less than £600 a year but it turned out not only that it was impractical for the purposes for which it was established but that those who were sent to detect thieves were often the depredators themselves".
[2]
In response to the second request, the former chief constable of
Newcastle upon Tyne City Police
, John Stephens, was appointed as Superintendent in August 1845, with 20 officers. The
Tyne Improvement Commission
was created in 1852, and the River Police were absorbed by them. The force was based at
Ouseburn
until a purpose built police station was eventually built at Mill Dam,
South Shields
in 1906.
[2]
By 1910, there were two police stations in Newcastle: a floating police station off Burrell Road and another police station and 'dead house' in Wincomblee, each commanded by an inspector.
[3]
Robert Farmer was appointed as Chief Officer of the River Police in 1884, and held this position until 1902.
[4]
20th century
[
edit
]
The force was not included in the recommendations made by the
Desborough
Committee and the subsequent
Police Act 1919
, because it was not funded from public funds, nor was it subject to inspection by
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary
. This was a matter of some consternation for local politicians: Member of Parliament for
Wallsend
Matt Simm
asked in 1920 whether the improvements to police terms and conditions would be applied to the River Police, but
Home Secretary
Edward Shortt
noted that although the force fell within the provisions of the
Police Act 1890
in respect of police pensions, pay was a matter for the force itself and not subject to national rules.
[5]
Newcastle upon Tyne East
MP
Harry Barnes
pressed the government to apply the national regulations to the River Police, but Shortt declined.
[6]
A similar question was asked ten years later, when
Leslie Hore-Belisha
drew attention to the fact that the River Tyne Commissioners did not comply with the requirements of the regulations under the Police Act 1919, and the Home Office minister
Alfred Short
described the force as being in an "exceptional position" as it was not subject to Government inspection and did not receive a grant from the
Treasury
, and so recognised that it was not within the scope of the
Home Office
to take any further action.
[7]
World War II
[
edit
]
During
World War II
, the police were involved in securing the ports and managing clearances with
HM Customs and Excise
.
[8]
From 30 November 1949 it also took over responsibility for policing on the property of the
Tyne Improvement Commission
from the disbanded
Tyne Improvement Commission Docks and Piers Police
.
[9]
In 1956, the force had 78 officers, and an annual budget of £52,642.
[9]
In 1965, the force policed the River Tyne, Albert Edward and Tyne docks and the Shields ferry. It had three stations: the headquarters at Mill Dam, South Shields, a station at Pipewellgate on the Gateshead side of the Swing Bridge, and others at Albert Edward Dock, Tyne Dock and on the North Shields Ferry Landing. The force also had a
Criminal Investigation Department
, who were based in the former Custom House on the Mill Dam. The strength of the force was one Chief Constable, one Chief Inspector, four Inspectors, ten uniformed Sergeants, a Detective Sergeant, 40 Constables and two Detective Constables.
[10]
In 1966, in response to a question from the Member of Parliament for
Wallsend
Ted Garrett
, then-Home Secretary
Roy Jenkins
stated that he was in favour of merging the River Police with the local police force, under the
Police Act 1964
.
[11]
On 1 August 1968, the force became part of
South Shields Borough Police
under the Port of Tyne Reorganisation Scheme 1967 Confirmation Order 1968, at which point it numbered 57 officers. The Borough Police merged with
Durham County Constabulary
on 1 October 1968 to form
Durham Constabulary
. In April 1974, this area came under the auspices of
Northumbria Police
.

Peter Foldy
is a Hungarian-born recording artist, film producer, director and screenwriter. He has been nominated for two
Juno Awards
and has had multiple top-ten hits across Canada and the U.S., most notably with his first song "Bondi Junction" which reached number one on the Canadian charts. He has written and directed numerous feature films working with actors such as
Paul Rudd
,
Eugene Levy
and Academy Award winner,
Louise Fletcher
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Peter Foldy was born in
Budapest
, Hungary but soon fled from the then Communist regime with his parents and sister. The family moved to Sydney, where Foldy attended high school and worked as an actor in television commercials. During this time, he also forged a friendship with three young brothers who would later find worldwide success as the
Bee Gees
.
After a family move to
Toronto
, Foldy enrolled in film school at
York University
, once again landing occasional work in Canadian TV commercials. He also formed a rock band that performed in various bars and lounges throughout the city.
Career
[
edit
]
Music
[
edit
]
Kanata records
[
edit
]
Foldy soon began writing songs and quickly landed a recording contract as an artist with a small indie label, Kanata Records. His first single, "Bondi Junction", was released in 1973 and the record eventually reached number one on
RPM
magazine
's Adult Contemporary chart
[1]
on July 7, 1973. Foldy was also featured on the cover of
RPM
that same week. The record received two Juno Award nominations, including Canadian Pop Music Single of the Year.
[2]
He was also awarded a 1973 BMI Canada Certificate of Honour from BMI Canada for "Bondi Junction" which was a legitimate national hit across Canada.
Foldy was suddenly appearing on Canadian TV shows, on radio station charts and on the pages of music magazines, including the popular U.S. teen publication,
16 Magazine
. "Bondi Junction" was also released in the U.S. on
Playboy Records
, a label started by Hugh Hefner, where it penetrated the U.S. market place.
Cash Box
reviewed the song as "a super commercial track that will immediately influence the teen set." The record also charted in
Billboard
.
Capitol-EMI and Polydor
[
edit
]
In 1975, Foldy was signed by
Capitol-EMI
of Canada alongside a deal with
Polydor
in the U.S. His follow-up recordings, "Roxanne" and "Julie-Ann" also reached top-ten status on many charts across Canada, as well as in the U.S.
In 1976, he again received a BMI Canada Certificate of Honour for "Roxanne" and once again made the cover of
RPM Weekly
on July 3, 1976 (volume 25 #14).
Free Flight records
[
edit
]
On the advice of his manager, Foldy left his deal with Capitol with the promise of bigger things in the United States which, unfortunately, failed to materialize. However, a pop label started by
RCA Records
in Los Angeles called Free Flight Records signed him a couple of years later. The move to Los Angeles allowed Foldy to continue his musical momentum with the self-written singles "Love City" and "School of Love", songs he co-produced with music producer,
Tony Brown
.
Bronte Road Music
[
edit
]
In 2016, Foldy released a 10-track CD featuring all-new music entitled
Nine Lives
. All songs were written and produced by Foldy. The CD received favorable reviews and radio airplay, particularly the single, "Carly".
The album has received critical acclaim by both the
Toronto Star
[3]
and
Cashbox Canada
.
[4]
A new single, "Toxic World" was released in 2019. Written by Foldy, it was co-produced with Miklos Malek. In 2020 he released the single, "This Christmas" co-produced with Gerry Stober and in 2021, another single, "Friend-Zone" was released through Foldy's Bronte Road Music label, also co-produced by Foldy and Miklos Malek.
Film
[
edit
]
When Free Flight Records abruptly closed its doors in 1981, Foldy turned his attention back to film, quickly selling his first screenplay,
Hot Moves
,
[5]
which became a considerable theatrical and video hit in the mid-1980s. In more recent pop culture, the film has been dubbed as the possible inspiration
[6]
for the 1999 Hollywood blockbuster
American Pie
.
More screenplays followed and in the early 1990s, Foldy started directing.
His feature film credits include:
1993:
Midnight Witness
starring
Jan-Michael Vincent
and
Maxwell Caulfield
1994:
Tryst
[7]
with
Barbara Carrera
,
David Warner
and

[11]
starring
Jen Lilley
2021:

[12]
with Sarah Fisher, Conner Floyd and Preston Ward.
Current projects
[
edit
]
Foldy is in development on several feature films as well as two plays,
Spin
and
Liverpool Lads
.
Spin
is a humorous look at the resistance received by Canadian artists when Canadian content regulations were introduced in the early 1970s, while
Liverpool Lads
is the true story of the first songwriters signed to the Beatles company, Apple, after a random meeting with
Paul McCartney
in London's High Park.  It is based on the book,
All You Need Is Luck... Or How I Got a Record Deal by Meeting Paul McCartney
, written by Paul Tennant. McCartney has added a glowing quote to the back of the book.
An avid photographer, Foldy has exhibited his black and white photographs.

Mathematics
is an area of
knowledge
that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of
number theory
,
[1]
algebra
,
[2]
geometry
,
[1]
and
analysis
,
[3]
[4]
respectively. There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their
academic discipline
.
Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of
abstract objects
and the use of pure
reason
to
prove
them. These objects consist of either
abstractions
from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called
axioms
. A
proof
consists of a succession of applications of
deductive rules
to already established results. These results include previously proved
theorems
, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.
[5]
Mathematics is essential in the
natural sciences
,
engineering
,
medicine
,
finance
,
computer science
and the
social sciences
. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as
statistics
and
game theory
, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under
applied mathematics
. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called
pure mathematics
), but often later find practical applications.
[6]
[7]
The problem of
integer factorization
, for example, which goes back to
Euclid
in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the
RSA cryptosystem
, now widely used for the security of
computer networks
.
Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated
mathematical rigour
first appeared in
Greek mathematics
, most notably in Euclid's
Elements
.
[8]
Since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided into geometry and
arithmetic
(the manipulation of
natural numbers
and
fractions
), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra
[a]
and
infinitesimal calculus
were introduced as new areas. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and
scientific discoveries
has led to a rapid lockstep increase in the development of both.
[9]
At the end of the 19th century, the
foundational crisis of mathematics
led to the systematization of the
axiomatic method
,
[10]
which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary
Mathematics Subject Classification
lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.
Etymology
The word
mathematics
comes from
Ancient Greek
máthēma
(
μάθημα
), meaning "that which is learnt",
[11]
"what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word came to have the narrower and more technical meaning of "mathematical study" even in
Classical times
.
[12]
Its
adjective
is
mathēmatikós
(
μαθηματικός
), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical".
[13]
In particular,
mathēmatikḗ tékhnē
(
μαθηματικὴ τέχνη
;
Latin
:
ars mathematica
) meant "the mathematical art".
[11]
Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in
Pythagoreanism
was known as the
mathēmatikoi
(μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of
arithmetic
and geometry. By the time of
Aristotle
(384-322 BC) this meaning was fully established.
[14]
In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term
mathematics
more commonly meant "
astrology
" (or sometimes "
astronomy
") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example,
Saint Augustine
's warning that Christians should beware of
mathematici
, meaning "astrologers", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.
[15]
The apparent
plural
form in English goes back to the Latin
neuter
plural
mathematica
(
Cicero
), based on the Greek plural
ta mathēmatiká
(
τὰ μαθηματικά
) and means roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective
mathematic(al)
and formed the noun
mathematics
anew, after the pattern of
physics
and
metaphysics
, inherited from Greek.
[16]
In English, the noun
mathematics
takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to
maths
or, in North America,
math
.
[17]
Areas of mathematics
Before the
Renaissance
, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and
geometry
, regarding the study of shapes.
[18]
Some types of
pseudoscience
, such as
numerology
and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.
[19]
During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared.
Mathematical notation
led to
algebra
which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of
formulas
.
Calculus
, consisting of the two subfields
differential calculus
and
integral calculus
, is the study of
continuous functions
, which model the typically
nonlinear relationships
between varying quantities, as represented by
variables
. This division into four main areas-arithmetic, geometry, algebra, calculus
[20]
-endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as
celestial mechanics
and
solid mechanics
were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics.
[21]
The subject of
combinatorics
has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.
[22]
At the end of the 19th century, the
foundational crisis in mathematics
and the resulting systematization of the
axiomatic method
led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics.
[23]
[10]
The 2020
Mathematics Subject Classification
contains no less than
sixty-three
first-level areas.
[24]
Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding
number theory
(the modern name for
higher arithmetic
) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have "geometry" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as
mathematical logic
and
foundations
.
[25]
Number theory
Main article:
Number theory
This is the
Ulam spiral
, which illustrates the distribution of
prime numbers
. The dark diagonal lines in the spiral hint at the hypothesized approximate
independence
between being prime and being a value of a quadratic polynomial, a conjecture now known as
Hardy and Littlewood's Conjecture F
.
Number theory began with the manipulation of
numbers
, that is,
natural numbers
(
N
)
,
{\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ),}
and later expanded to
integers
(
Z
)
{\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} )}
and
rational numbers
(
Q
)
.
{\displaystyle (\mathbb {Q} ).}
Number theory was once called arithmetic, but nowadays this term is mostly used for
numerical calculations
.
[26]
Number theory dates back to ancient
Babylon
and probably
China
. Two prominent early number theorists were
Euclid
of ancient Greece and
Diophantus
of Alexandria.
[27]
The modern study of number theory in its abstract form is largely attributed to
Pierre de Fermat
and
Leonhard Euler
. The field came to full fruition with the contributions of
Adrien-Marie Legendre
and
Carl Friedrich Gauss
.
[28]
Many easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods, often from across mathematics. A prominent example is
Fermat's Last Theorem
. This conjecture was stated in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat, but it
was proved
only in 1994 by
Andrew Wiles
, who used tools including
scheme theory
from
algebraic geometry
,
category theory
, and
homological algebra
.
[29]
Another example is
Goldbach's conjecture
, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two
prime numbers
. Stated in 1742 by
Christian Goldbach
, it remains unproven despite considerable effort.
[30]
Number theory includes several subareas, including
analytic number theory
,
algebraic number theory
,
geometry of numbers
(method oriented),
diophantine equations
, and
transcendence theory
(problem oriented).
[25]
Geometry
Main article:
Geometry
On the surface of a sphere, Euclidean geometry only applies as a local approximation. For larger scales the sum of the angles of a triangle is not equal to 180°.
Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as
lines
,
angles
and
circles
, which were developed mainly for the needs of
surveying
and
architecture
, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields.
[31]
A fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of
proofs
, which require that every assertion must be
proved
. For example, it is not sufficient to verify by
measurement
that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (
theorems
) and a few basic statements. The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (
postulates
), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (
axioms
). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by
Euclid
around 300 BC in his book
Elements
.
[32]
[33]
The resulting
Euclidean geometry
is the study of shapes and their arrangements
constructed
from lines,
planes
and circles in the
Euclidean plane
(
plane geometry
) and the three-dimensional
Euclidean space
.
[b]
[31]
Euclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when
René Descartes
introduced what is now called
Cartesian coordinates
. This constituted a major
change of paradigm
: Instead of defining
real numbers
as lengths of
line segments
(see
number line
), it allowed the representation of points using their
coordinates
, which are numbers. Algebra (and later, calculus) can thus be used to solve geometrical problems. Geometry was split into two new subfields:
synthetic geometry
, which uses purely geometrical methods, and
analytic geometry
, which uses coordinates systemically.
[34]
Analytic geometry allows the study of
curves
unrelated to circles and lines. Such curves can be defined as the
graph of functions
, the study of which led to
differential geometry
. They can also be defined as
implicit equations
, often
polynomial equations
(which spawned
algebraic geometry
). Analytic geometry also makes it possible to consider Euclidean spaces of higher than three dimensions.
[31]
In the 19th century, mathematicians discovered
non-Euclidean geometries
, which do not follow the
parallel postulate
. By questioning that postulate's truth, this discovery has been viewed as joining
Russell's paradox
in revealing the
foundational crisis of mathematics
. This aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the axiomatic method, and adopting that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical problem.
[35]
[10]
In turn, the axiomatic method allows for the study of various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that
do not change
under specific transformations of the
space
.
[36]
Today's subareas of geometry include:
[25]
Projective geometry
, introduced in the 16th century by
Girard Desargues
, extends Euclidean geometry by adding
points at infinity
at which
parallel lines
intersect. This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines.
Affine geometry
, the study of properties relative to
parallelism
and independent from the concept of length.
Differential geometry
, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using
differentiable functions
.
Manifold theory
, the study of shapes that are not necessarily embedded in a larger space.
Riemannian geometry
, the study of distance properties in curved spaces.
Algebraic geometry
, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using
polynomials
.
Topology
, the study of properties that are kept under
continuous deformations
.
Algebraic topology
, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly
homological algebra
.
Discrete geometry
, the study of finite configurations in geometry.
Convex geometry
, the study of
convex sets
, which takes its importance from its applications in
optimization
.
Complex geometry
, the geometry obtained by replacing real numbers with
complex numbers
.
Algebra
Main article:
Algebra
The
quadratic formula
, which concisely expresses the solutions of all
quadratic equations
The
Rubik's Cube group
is a concrete application of
group theory
.
[37]
Algebra is the art of manipulating
equations
and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and
al-Khwarizmi
(9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra.
[38]
[39]
Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution. Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side. The term
algebra
is derived from the
Arabic
word
al-jabr
meaning 'the reunion of broken parts'
[40]
that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of
his main treatise
.
Algebra became an area in its own right only with
François Viète
(1540-1603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers.
[41]
Variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using
mathematical formulas
.
Until the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of
linear equations
(presently
linear algebra
), and polynomial equations in a single
unknown
, which were called
algebraic equations
(a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). During the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as
matrices
,
modular integers
, and
geometric transformations
), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid.
[42]
The concept of
algebraic structure
addresses this, consisting of a
set
whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. The scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. This object of algebra was called
modern algebra
or
abstract algebra
, as established by the influence and works of
Emmy Noether
.
[43]
(The latter term appears mainly in an educational context, in opposition to
elementary algebra
, which is concerned with the older way of manipulating formulas.)
Some types of algebraic structures have useful and often fundamental properties, in many areas of mathematics. Their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include:
[25]
group theory
;
field theory
;
vector spaces
, whose study is essentially the same as
linear algebra
;
ring theory
;
commutative algebra
, which is the study of
commutative rings
, includes the study of
polynomials
, and is a foundational part of
algebraic geometry
;
homological algebra
;
Lie algebra
and
Lie group
theory;
Boolean algebra
, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of
computers
.
The study of types of algebraic structures as
mathematical objects
is the purpose of
universal algebra
and
category theory
.
[44]
The latter applies to every
mathematical structure
(not only algebraic ones). At its origin, it was introduced, together with homological algebra for allowing the algebraic study of non-algebraic objects such as
topological spaces
; this particular area of application is called
algebraic topology
.
[45]
Calculus and analysis
Main articles:
Calculus
and
Mathematical analysis
A
Cauchy sequence
consists of elements such that all subsequent terms of a term become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses (from left to right).
Calculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians
Newton
and
Leibniz
.
[46]
It is fundamentally the study of the relationship of variables that depend on each other. Calculus was expanded in the 18th century by
Euler
with the introduction of the concept of a
function
and many other results.
[47]
Presently, "calculus" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and "analysis" is commonly used for advanced parts.
Analysis is further subdivided into
real analysis
, where variables represent
real numbers
, and
complex analysis
, where variables represent
complex numbers
. Analysis includes many subareas shared by other areas of mathematics which include:
[25]
Multivariable calculus
Functional analysis
, where variables represent varying functions;
Integration
,
measure theory
and
potential theory
, all strongly related with
probability theory
on a
continuum
;
Ordinary differential equations
;
Partial differential equations
;
Numerical analysis
, mainly devoted to the computation on computers of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in many applications.
Discrete mathematics
Main article:
Discrete mathematics
A diagram representing a two-state
Markov chain
. The states are represented by 'A' and 'E'. The numbers are the probability of flipping the state.
Discrete mathematics, broadly speaking, is the study of individual,
countable
mathematical objects. An example is the set of all integers.
[48]
Because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply.
[c]
Algorithms
—especially their
implementation
and
computational complexity
—play a major role in discrete mathematics.
[49]
The
four color theorem
and
optimal sphere packing
were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century.
[50]
The
P versus NP problem
, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of
computationally difficult
problems.
[51]
Discrete mathematics includes:
[25]
Combinatorics
, the art of enumerating mathematical objects that satisfy some given constraints. Originally, these objects were elements or
subsets
of a given
set
; this has been extended to various objects, which establishes a strong link between combinatorics and other parts of discrete mathematics. For example, discrete geometry includes counting configurations of
geometric shapes
Graph theory
and
hypergraphs
Coding theory
, including
error correcting codes
and a part of
cryptography
Matroid
theory
Discrete geometry
Discrete probability distributions
Game theory
(although
continuous games
are also studied, most common games, such as
chess
and
poker
are discrete)
Discrete optimization
, including
combinatorial optimization
,
integer programming
,
constraint programming
Mathematical logic and set theory
Main articles:
Mathematical logic
and
Set theory
The
Venn diagram
is a commonly used method to illustrate the relations between sets.
The two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century.
[52]
[53]
Before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and
logic
, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to
philosophy
and was not specifically studied by mathematicians.
[54]
Before
Cantor
's study of
infinite sets
, mathematicians were reluctant to consider
actually infinite
collections, and considered
infinity
to be the result of endless
enumeration
. Cantor's work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets
[55]
but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per
Cantor's diagonal argument
. This led to the
controversy over Cantor's set theory
.
[56]
In the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring
mathematical rigour
. Examples of such intuitive definitions are "a set is a collection of objects", "natural number is what is used for counting", "a point is a shape with a zero length in every direction", "a curve is a trace left by a moving point", etc.
This became the foundational crisis of mathematics.
[57]
It was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a
formalized set theory
. Roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have.
[23]
For example, in
Peano arithmetic
, the natural numbers are defined by "zero is a number", "each number has a unique successor", "each number but zero has a unique predecessor", and some rules of reasoning.
[58]
This
mathematical abstraction
from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of
formalism
, as founded by
David Hilbert
around 1910.
[59]
The "nature" of the objects defined this way is a philosophical problem that mathematicians leave to philosophers, even if many mathematicians have opinions on this nature, and use their opinion—sometimes called "intuition"—to guide their study and proofs. The approach allows considering "logics" (that is, sets of allowed deducing rules), theorems, proofs, etc. as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. For example,
Gödel's incompleteness theorems
assert, roughly speaking that, in every
consistent
formal system
that contains the natural numbers, there are theorems that are true (that is provable in a stronger system), but not provable inside the system.
[60]
This approach to the foundations of mathematics was challenged during the first half of the 20th century by mathematicians led by
Brouwer
, who promoted
intuitionistic logic
, which explicitly lacks the
law of excluded middle
.
[61]
[62]
These problems and debates led to a wide expansion of mathematical logic, with subareas such as
model theory
(modeling some logical theories inside other theories),
proof theory
,
type theory
,
computability theory
and
computational complexity theory
.
[25]
Although these aspects of mathematical logic were introduced before the rise of
computers
, their use in
compiler
design,
program certification
,
proof assistants
and other aspects of
computer science
, contributed in turn to the expansion of these logical theories.
[63]
Statistics and other decision sciences
Main articles:
Statistics
and
Probability theory
Whatever the form of a random population
distribution
(μ), the sampling
mean
(x̄) tends to a
Gaussian
distribution and its
variance
(σ) is given by the
central limit theorem
of probability theory.
[64]
The field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods especially
probability theory
. Statisticians generate data with
random sampling
or randomized
experiments
.
[65]
The design of a statistical sample or experiment determines the analytical methods that will be used. Analysis of data from
observational studies
is done using
statistical models
and the theory of
inference
, using
model selection
and
estimation
. The models and consequential
predictions
should then be
tested
against
new data
.
[d]
Statistical theory
studies
decision problems
such as minimizing the
risk
(
expected loss
) of a statistical action, such as using a
procedure
in, for example,
parameter estimation
,
hypothesis testing
, and
selecting the best
. In these traditional areas of
mathematical statistics
, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an
objective function
, like expected loss or
cost
, under specific constraints. For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.
[66]
Because of its use of
optimization
, the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other
decision sciences
, such as
operations research
,
control theory
, and
mathematical economics
.
[67]
Computational mathematics
Main article:
Computational mathematics
Computational mathematics is the study of
mathematical problems
that are typically too large for human, numerical capacity.
[68]
[69]
Numerical analysis
studies methods for problems in
analysis
using
functional analysis
and
approximation theory
; numerical analysis broadly includes the study of
approximation
and
discretization
with special focus on
rounding errors
.
[70]
Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic-
matrix
-and-
graph theory
. Other areas of computational mathematics include
computer algebra
and
symbolic computation
.
History
Main article:
History of mathematics
Ancient
The history of mathematics is an ever-growing series of abstractions. Evolutionarily speaking, the first abstraction to ever be discovered, one shared by many animals,
[71]
was probably that of numbers: the realization that, for example, a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (say) have something in common, namely that there are
two
of them. As evidenced by
tallies
found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to
count
physical objects,
prehistoric
peoples may have also known how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.
[72]
[73]
The Babylonian mathematical tablet
Plimpton 322
, dated to 1800 BC
Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000
BC
, when the
Babylonians
and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra, and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.
[74]
The oldest mathematical texts from
Mesopotamia
and
Egypt
are from 2000 to 1800 BC. Many early texts mention
Pythagorean triples
and so, by inference, the
Pythagorean theorem
seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical concept after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that
elementary arithmetic
(
addition
,
subtraction
,
multiplication
, and
division
) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a
sexagesimal
numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.
[75]
In the 6th century BC, Greek mathematics began to emerge as a distinct discipline and some
Ancient Greeks
such as the
Pythagoreans
appeared to have considered it a subject in its own right.
[76]
Around 300 BC, Euclid organized mathematical knowledge by way of postulates and first principles, which evolved into the axiomatic method that is used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.
[77]
His book,
Elements
, is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.
[78]
The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be
Archimedes
(
c.
287
- c.
212 BC
) of
Syracuse
.
[79]
He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of
solids of revolution
and used the
method of exhaustion
to calculate the
area
under the arc of a
parabola
with the
summation of an infinite series
, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.
[80]
Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are
conic sections
(
Apollonius of Perga
, 3rd century BC),
[81]
trigonometry
(
Hipparchus of Nicaea
, 2nd century BC),
[82]
and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).
[83]
The numerals used in the
Bakhshali manuscript
, dated between the 2nd century BC and the 2nd century AD
The
Hindu-Arabic numeral system
and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in
India
and were transmitted to the
Western world
via
Islamic mathematics
.
[84]
Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition and approximation of
sine
and
cosine
, and an early form of
infinite series
.
[85]
[86]
Medieval and later
A page from al-Khwārizmī's
Algebra
During the
Golden Age of Islam
, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. Other achievements of the Islamic period include advances in
spherical trigonometry
and the addition of the
decimal point
to the Arabic numeral system.
[87]
Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarismi,
Omar Khayyam
and
Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī
.
[88]
The Greek and Arabic mathematical texts were in turn translated to Latin during the Middle Ages and made available in Europe.
[89]
During the
early modern period
, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in
Western Europe
, with innovations that revolutionized mathematics, such as the introduction of variables and
symbolic notation
by François Viète (1540-1603), the introduction of
logarithms
by
John Napier
in 1614, which greatly simplified numerical calculations, especially for
astronomy
and
marine navigation
, the introduction of coordinates by René Descartes (1596-1650) for reducing geometry to algebra, and the development of calculus by Isaac Newton (1642-1726/27) and
Gottfried Leibniz
(1646-1716). Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, unified these innovations into a single corpus with a standardized terminology, and completed them with the discovery and the proof of numerous theorems.
Carl Friedrich Gauss
Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis,
differential geometry
,
matrix theory
, number theory, and
statistics
.
[90]
In the early 20th century,
Kurt Gödel
transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system—if powerful enough to describe arithmetic—will contain true propositions that cannot be proved.
[60]
Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and
science
, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made to this very day. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society
, "The number of papers and books included in the
Mathematical Reviews
database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs."
[91]
Symbolic notation and terminology
Main articles:

Glossary of mathematics
An explanation of the sigma (Σ)
summation
notation
Mathematical notation is widely used in science and
engineering
for representing complex
concepts
and
properties
in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way. This notation consists of
symbols
used for representing
operations
, unspecified numbers,
relations
and any other mathematical objects, and then assembling them into
expressions
and formulas.
[92]
More precisely, numbers and other mathematical objects are represented by symbols called variables, which are generally
Latin
or
Greek
letters, and often include
subscripts
. Operation and relations are generally represented by specific
symbols
or
glyphs
,
[93]
such as
+
(
plus
),
×
(
multiplication
),
∫
{\textstyle \int }
(
integral
),
=
(
equal
), and
<
(
less than
).
[94]
All these symbols are generally grouped according to specific rules to form expressions and formulas.
[95]
Normally, expressions and formulas do not appear alone, but are included in sentences of the current language, where expressions play the role of
noun phrases
and formulas play the role of
clauses
.
Mathematics has developed a rich terminology covering a broad range of fields that study the properties of various abstract, idealized objects and how they interact. It is based on rigorous
definitions
that provide a standard foundation for communication. An axiom or
postulate
is a mathematical statement that is taken to be true without need of proof. If a mathematical statement has yet to be proven (or disproven), it is termed a
conjecture
. Through a series of rigorous arguments employing
deductive reasoning
, a statement that is
proven
to be true becomes a theorem. A specialized theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem is called a
lemma
. A proven instance that forms part of a more general finding is termed a
corollary
.
[96]
Numerous technical terms used in mathematics are
neologisms
, such as
polynomial
and
homeomorphism
.
[97]
Other technical terms are words of the common language that are used in an accurate meaning that may differ slightly from their common meaning. For example, in mathematics, "
or
" means "one, the other or both", while, in common language, it is either ambiguous or means "one or the other but not both" (in mathematics, the latter is called "
exclusive or
"). Finally, many mathematical terms are common words that are used with a completely different meaning.
[98]
This may lead to sentences that are correct and true mathematical assertions, but appear to be nonsense to people who do not have the required background. For example, "every
free module
is
flat
" and "a
field
is always a
ring
".
Relationship with sciences
Mathematics is used in most
sciences
for
modeling
phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws.
[99]
The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model.
[100]
Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by invalid mathematical concepts, imply the need to change the mathematical model used.
[101]
For example, the
perihelion precession of Mercury
could only be explained after the emergence of
Einstein
's
general relativity
, which replaced
Newton's law of gravitation
as a better mathematical model.
[102]
There is still a
philosophical
debate whether mathematics is a science. However, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences. Like them, it is
falsifiable
, which means in mathematics that, if a result or a theory is wrong, this can be proved by providing a
counterexample
. Similarly as in science,
theories
and results (theorems) are often obtained from
experimentation
.
[103]
In mathematics, the experimentation may consist of computation on selected examples or of the study of figures or other representations of mathematical objects (often mind representations without physical support). For example, when asked how he came about his theorems, Gauss once replied "durch planmässiges Tattonieren" (through systematic experimentation).
[104]
However, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not
relying
on empirical evidence.
[105]
[106]
[107]
[108]
Pure and applied mathematics
Main articles:
Applied mathematics
and
Pure mathematics
Isaac Newton (left) and
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
developed infinitesimal calculus.
Until the 19th century, the development of mathematics in the West was mainly motivated by the needs of
technology
and science, and there was no clear distinction between pure and applied mathematics.
[109]
For example, the natural numbers and arithmetic were introduced for the need of counting, and geometry was motivated by surveying, architecture and astronomy. Later, Isaac Newton introduced infinitesimal calculus for explaining the movement of the
planets
with his law of gravitation. Moreover, most mathematicians were also scientists, and many scientists were also mathematicians.
[110]
However, a notable exception occurred with the tradition of
pure mathematics in Ancient Greece
.
[111]
In the 19th century, mathematicians such as
Karl Weierstrass
and
Richard Dedekind
increasingly focused their research on internal problems, that is,
pure mathematics
.
[109]
[112]
This led to split mathematics into
pure mathematics
and
applied mathematics
, the latter being often considered as having a lower value among mathematical purists. However, the lines between the two are frequently blurred.
[113]
The aftermath of
World War II
led to a surge in the development of applied mathematics in the US and elsewhere.
[114]
[115]
Many of the theories developed for applications were found interesting from the point of view of pure mathematics, and many results of pure mathematics were shown to have applications outside mathematics; in turn, the study of these applications may give new insights on the "pure theory".
[116]
[117]
An example of the first case is the
theory of distributions
, introduced by
Laurent Schwartz
for validating computations done in
quantum mechanics
, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis.
[118]
An example of the second case is the
decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers
, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by
Alfred Tarski
, with an algorithm that is impossible to
implement
because of a computational complexity that is much too high.
[119]
For getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities,
George Collins
introduced the
cylindrical algebraic decomposition
that became a fundamental tool in
real algebraic geometry
.
[120]
In the present day, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a question of personal research aim of mathematicians than a division of mathematics into broad areas.
[121]
[122]
The Mathematics Subject Classification has a section for "general applied mathematics" but does not mention "pure mathematics".
[25]
However, these terms are still used in names of some
university
departments, such as at the
Faculty of Mathematics
at the
University of Cambridge
.
Unreasonable effectiveness
The
unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics
is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist
Eugene Wigner
.
[7]
It is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the "purest") have applications outside their initial object. These applications may be completely outside their initial area of mathematics, and may concern physical phenomena that were completely unknown when the mathematical theory was introduced.
[123]
Examples of unexpected applications of mathematical theories can be found in many areas of mathematics.
A notable example is the
prime factorization
of natural numbers that was discovered more than 2,000 years before its common use for secure
internet
communications through the
RSA cryptosystem
.
[124]
A second historical example is the theory of
ellipses
. They were studied by the
ancient Greek mathematicians
as
conic sections
(that is, intersections of
cones
with planes). It is almost 2,000 years later that
Johannes Kepler
discovered that the
trajectories
of the planets are ellipses.
[125]
In the 19th century, the internal development of geometry (pure mathematics) led to definition and study of non-Euclidean geometries, spaces of dimension higher than three and
manifolds
. At this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century,
Albert Einstein
developed the
theory of relativity
that uses fundamentally these concepts. In particular,
spacetime
of
special relativity
is a non-Euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of
general relativity
is a (curved) manifold of dimension four.
[126]
[127]
A striking aspect of the interaction between mathematics and physics is when mathematics drives research in physics. This is illustrated by the discoveries of the
positron
and the
baryon
Ω
−
.
{\displaystyle \Omega ^{-}.}
In both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown
particle
, and the search for these particles. In both cases, these particles were discovered a few years later by specific experiments.

Physics
Main article:
Relationship between mathematics and physics
Diagram of a pendulum
Mathematics and physics have influenced each other over their modern history. Modern physics uses mathematics abundantly,
[131]
and is also the motivation of major mathematical developments.
[132]
Computing
Further information:
Theoretical computer science
and
Computational mathematics
The rise of technology in the 20th century opened the way to a new science:
computing
.
[e]
This field is closely related to mathematics in several ways.
Theoretical computer science
is essentially mathematical in nature. Communication technologies apply branches of mathematics that may be very old (e.g., arithmetic), especially with respect to transmission security, in
cryptography
and
coding theory
.
Discrete mathematics
is useful in many areas of computer science, such as
complexity theory
,
information theory
,
graph theory
, and so on.
[

]
In return, computing has also become essential for obtaining new results. This is a group of techniques known as
experimental mathematics
, which is the use of
experimentation
to discover mathematical insights.
[133]
The most well-known example is the
four-color theorem
, which was proven in 1976 with the help of a computer. This revolutionized traditional mathematics, where the rule was that the mathematician should verify each part of the proof. In 1998, the
Kepler conjecture
on
sphere packing
seemed to also be partially proven by computer. An international team had since worked on writing a formal proof; it was finished (and verified) in 2015.
[134]
Once written formally, a proof can be verified using a program called a
proof assistant
.
[135]
These programs are useful in situations where one is uncertain about a proof's correctness.
[135]
A major open problem in theoretical computer science is
P versus NP
. It is one of the seven
Millennium Prize Problems
.
[136]
Biology and chemistry

Biology
uses probability extensively - for example, in ecology or
neurobiology
.
[137]
Most of the discussion of probability in biology, however, centers on the concept of
evolutionary fitness
.
[137]
Ecology heavily uses modeling to simulate
population dynamics
,
[137]
[138]
study ecosystems such as the predator-prey model, measure pollution diffusion,
[139]
or to assess climate change.
[140]
The dynamics of a population can be modeled by coupled differential equations, such as the
Lotka-Volterra equations
.
[141]
However, there is the problem of
model validation
. This is particularly acute when the results of modeling influence political decisions; the existence of contradictory models could allow nations to choose the most favorable model.

Genotype evolution can be modeled with the

Since the start of the 20th century, chemistry has used computing to model molecules in three dimensions. It turns out that the form of
macromolecules
in biology is variable and determines the action. Such modeling uses Euclidean geometry; neighboring atoms form a
polyhedron
whose distances and angles are fixed by the laws of interaction.

Social sciences

Mathematical economics
and
Historical dynamics
Areas of mathematics used in the social sciences include probability/statistics and differential equations (
stochastic
or deterministic).
[

These areas are used in fields such as
sociology

Supply and demand curves
, like this one, are a staple of mathematical economics.
The fundamental postulate of mathematical economics is that of the rational individual actor -
Homo economicus
(
lit.
'economic man').
[145]
In this model, each individual seeks to maximize their
self-interest
,
[145]
and always makes optimal choices using
perfect information
.
[146]
[
better source needed
]
This atomistic view of economics allows it to relatively easily mathematize its thinking, because individual
calculations
are transposed into mathematical calculations. Such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms which would be very difficult to discover by a "literary" analysis.
[
citation needed
]
For example, explanations of
economic cycles
are not trivial. Without mathematical modeling, it is hard to go beyond simple statistical observations or unproven speculation.
[
citation needed
]
However, many people have rejected or criticized the concept of
Homo economicus
.
[146]
[

Economists note that real people usually have limited information and often make poor choices.
[146]
[

Also, as shown in laboratory experiments, people care about fairness and sometimes altruism, not just personal gain.
[146]
[

According to critics, mathematization is a veneer that allows for the material's scientific valorization.
[

At the start of the 20th century, there was a movement to express historical movements in formulas.
[
citation needed
]
In 1922,
Nikolai Kondratiev
discerned the ~50-year-long
Kondratiev cycle
, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis.
[147]
Towards the end of the 19th century,
Nicolas-Remi Brück
[
fr
]
and
Charles Henri Lagrange
[
fr
]
had extended their analysis into
geopolitics
. They wanted to establish the historical existence of vast movements that took peoples to their apogee, then to their decline.
[148]
[

More recently,
Peter Turchin
has been working on developing
cliodynamics
since the 1990s.
[149]
(In particular, he discovered the
Turchin cycle
, which predicts that violence spikes in a short cycle of ~50-year intervals, superimposed over a longer cycle of ~200-300 years.
[150]
)
Even so, mathematization of the social sciences is not without danger. In the controversial book
Fashionable Nonsense
(1997),
Sokal
and
Bricmont
denounced the unfounded or abusive use of scientific terminology, particularly from mathematics or physics, in the social sciences. The study of
complex systems
(evolution of unemployment, business capital, demographic evolution of a population, etc.) uses elementary mathematical knowledge. However, the choice of counting criteria, particularly for unemployment, or of models can be subject to controversy.

Relationship with astrology and esotericism
Some renowned mathematicians have also been considered to be renowned astrologists; for example,
Ptolemy
, Arab astronomers,
Regiomantus
,
Cardano
,
Kepler
, or
John Dee
. In the Middle Ages, astrology was considered a science that included mathematics. In his encyclopedia,
Theodor Zwinger
wrote that astrology was a mathematical science that studied the "active movement of bodies as they act on other bodies". He reserved to mathematics the need to "calculate with probability the influences [of stars]" to foresee their "conjunctions and oppositions".
[151]
Astrology is no longer considered a science.
[152]
Philosophy
Main article:
Philosophy of mathematics
Reality
The connection between mathematics and material reality has led to philosophical debates since at least the time of
Pythagoras
. The ancient philosopher
Plato
argued that abstractions  that reflect material reality have themselves a reality that exists outside space and time. As a result, the philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist on their own in abstraction is often referred to as
Platonism
. Independently of their possible philosophical opinions, modern mathematicians may be generally considered as Platonists, since they think of and talk of their objects of study as real objects.
[153]
Armand Borel
summarized this view of mathematics reality as follows, and provided quotations of
G. H. Hardy
,
Charles Hermite
,
Henri Poincaré
and Albert Einstein that support his views.
[128]
Something becomes objective (as opposed to "subjective") as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together.
[154]
Because the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In my opinion, that is sufficient to provide us with a
feeling
of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics ...
Nevertheless, Platonism and the concurrent views on abstraction do not explain the
unreasonable effectiveness
of mathematics.
[155]
Proposed definitions
Main article:
Definitions of mathematics
There is no general consensus about a definition of mathematics or its
epistemological status
—that is, its place among other human activities.
[156]
[157]
A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.
[156]
There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.
[157]
Some just say, "mathematics is what mathematicians do".
[156]
This makes sense, as there is a strong consensus among them about what is mathematics and what is not. Most proposed definitions try to define mathematics by its object of study.
[158]
Aristotle defined mathematics as "the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" from real instances set mathematics apart.
[159]
In the 19th century, when mathematicians began to address topics—such as infinite sets—which have no clear-cut relation to physical reality, a variety of new definitions were given.
[160]
With the large number of new areas of mathematics that appeared since the beginning of the 20th century and continue to appear, defining mathematics by this object of study becomes an impossible task.
Another approach for defining mathematics is to use its methods. So, an area of study can be qualified as mathematics as soon as one can prove theorems—assertions whose validity relies on a proof, that is, a purely-logical deduction.
[161]
Others take the perspective that mathematics is an investigation of axiomatic set theory, as this study is now a foundational discipline for much of modern mathematics.
[162]
Rigor
See also:
Logic
Mathematical reasoning requires
rigor
. This means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the
proofs
must be reducible to a succession of applications of
inference rules
,
[f]
without any use of empirical evidence and
intuition
.
[g]
[163]
Rigorous reasoning is not specific to mathematics, but, in mathematics, the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere. Despite mathematics'
concision
, rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express. The emergence of
computer-assisted proofs
has allowed proof lengths to further expand,
[h]
[164]
such as the 255-page
Feit-Thompson theorem
.
[i]
The result of this trend is a philosophy of the
quasi-empiricist
proof that can not be considered infallible, but has a probability attached to it.
[10]
The concept of rigor in mathematics dates back to ancient Greece, where their society encouraged logical, deductive reasoning. However, this rigorous approach would tend to discourage exploration of new approaches, such as irrational numbers and concepts of infinity. The method of demonstrating rigorous proof was enhanced in the sixteenth century through the use of symbolic notation. In the 18th century, social transition led to mathematicians earning their keep through teaching, which led to more careful thinking about the underlying concepts of mathematics. This produced more rigorous approaches, while transitioning from geometric methods to algebraic and then arithmetic proofs.
[10]
At the end of the 19th century, it appeared that the definitions of the basic concepts of mathematics were not accurate enough for avoiding paradoxes (non-Euclidean geometries and
Weierstrass function
) and contradictions (Russell's paradox). This was solved by the inclusion of axioms with the
apodictic
inference rules of mathematical theories; the re-introduction of axiomatic method pioneered by the ancient Greeks.
[10]
It results that "rigor" is no more a relevant concept in mathematics, as a proof is either correct or erroneous, and a "rigorous proof" is simply a
pleonasm
. Where a special concept of rigor comes into play is in the socialized aspects of a proof, wherein it may be demonstrably refuted by other mathematicians. After a proof has been accepted for many years or even decades, it can then be considered as reliable.
[165]
Nevertheless, the concept of "rigor" may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof.
[166]
Training and practice
Education
Main article:
Mathematics education
Mathematics has a remarkable ability to cross cultural boundaries and time periods. As a
human activity
, the practice of mathematics has a social side, which includes
education
,
careers
,
recognition
,
popularization
, and so on. In education, mathematics is a core part of the curriculum and forms an important element of the
STEM
academic disciplines. Prominent careers for professional mathematicians include math teacher or professor,
statistician
,
actuary
,
financial analyst
,
economist
,
accountant
,
commodity trader
, or
computer consultant
.
[167]
Archaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium BCE in ancient Babylonia.
[168]
Comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the
ancient Near East
and then for the
Greco-Roman world
starting around 300 BCE.
[169]
The oldest known mathematics textbook is the
Rhind papyrus
, dated from
c.
1650 BCE
in Egypt.
[170]
Due to a scarcity of books, mathematical teachings in ancient India were communicated using memorized
oral tradition
since the
Vedic period
(
c.
1500
- c.
500 BCE
).
[171]
In
Imperial China
during the
Tang dynasty
(618-907 CE), a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the
civil service exam
to join the state bureaucracy.
[172]
Following the
Dark Ages
, mathematics education in Europe was provided by religious schools as part of the
Quadrivium
. Formal instruction in
pedagogy
began with
Jesuit
schools in the 16th and 17th century. Most mathematical curriculum remained at a basic and practical level until the nineteenth century, when it began to flourish in France and Germany. The oldest journal addressing instruction in mathematics was
L'Enseignement Mathématique
, which began publication in 1899.
[173]
The Western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nation-states, with mathematics as a core component—initially for its military applications.
[174]
While the content of courses varies, in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time.
[175]
During school, mathematical capabilities and positive expectations have a strong association with career interest in the field. Extrinsic factors such as feedback motivation by teachers, parents, and peer groups can influence the level of interest in mathematics.
[176]
Some students studying math may develop an apprehension or fear about their performance in the subject. This is known as
math anxiety
or math phobia, and is considered the most prominent of the disorders impacting academic performance. Math anxiety can develop due to various  factors such as parental and teacher attitudes, social stereotypes, and personal traits. Help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches, by interactions with parents and teachers, and by tailored treatments for the individual.
[177]
Psychology (aesthetic, creativity and intuition)
The validity of a mathematical theorem relies only on the rigor of its proof, which could theoretically be done automatically by a
computer program
. This does not mean that there is no place for creativity in a mathematical work. On the contrary, many important mathematical results (theorems) are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve, and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process.
[178]
[179]
An extreme example is
Apery's theorem
:
Roger Apery
provided only the ideas for a proof, and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians.
[180]
Creativity and rigor are not the only psychological aspects of the activity of mathematicians. Some mathematicians can see their activity as a game, more specifically as solving
puzzles
.
[181]
This aspect of mathematical activity is emphasized in
recreational mathematics
.
Mathematicians can find an
aesthetic
value to mathematics. Like
beauty
, it is hard to define, it is commonly related to
elegance
, which involves qualities like
simplicity
,
symmetry
, completeness, and generality. G. H. Hardy in
A Mathematician's Apology
expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He also identified other criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, and inevitability, which contribute to mathematical aesthetic.
[182]
Paul Erdős
expressed this sentiment more ironically by speaking of "The Book", a supposed divine collection of the most beautiful proofs. The 1998 book
Proofs from THE BOOK
, inspired by Erdős, is a collection of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments. Some examples of particularly elegant results included are Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and the
fast Fourier transform
for
harmonic analysis
.
[183]
Some feel that to consider mathematics a science is to downplay its artistry and history in the seven traditional
liberal arts
.
[184]
One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematical results are
created
(as in art) or
discovered
(as in science).
[128]
The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.
In the 20th century, the mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer even initiated a philosophical perspective known as
intuitionism
, which primarily identifies mathematics with certain creative processes in the mind.
[59]
Intuitionism is in turn one flavor of a stance known as
constructivism
, which only considers a mathematical object valid if it can be directly constructed, not merely guaranteed by logic indirectly. This leads committed constructivists to reject certain results, particularly arguments like
existential proofs
based on the law of excluded middle.
[185]
In the end, neither constructivism nor intuitionism displaced
classical mathematics
or achieved mainstream acceptance. However, these programs have motivated specific developments, such as intuitionistic logic and other foundational insights, which are appreciated in their own right.
[185]

Traité de l'harmonie réduite à ses principes naturels

Notes that sound well together to a Western ear are sounds whose fundamental
frequencies
of vibration are in simple ratios. For example, an octave doubles the frequency and a
perfect fifth
multiplies it by
3

{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}
.
[186]
[187]
[

This link between frequencies and
harmony
was discussed in
Traité de l'harmonie réduite à ses principes naturels
by
Jean-Philippe Rameau
,
[188]
a French baroque composer and music theoretician. It rests on the analysis of harmonics (noted 2 to 15 in the following figure) of a fundamental Do (noted 1); the first harmonics and their octaves sound well together.
Harmonics on a staff
The curve in red has a
logarithmic
shape, which reflects the following two phenomena:
The pitch of the sound, which in our auditory system is proportional to the logarithm of the sound's frequency.
The harmonic frequencies, which are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.
Fractal
with a scaling symmetry and a central symmetry
Humans, as well as some other animals, find symmetric patterns to be more beautiful.
[189]
Mathematically, the symmetries of an object form a group known as the
symmetry group
.
[190]
For example, the group underlying mirror symmetry is the
cyclic group
of two elements,
Z
/
2
Z
{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} }
. A
Rorschach test
is a figure invariant by this symmetry, as well as a
butterfly
, and animal bodies more generally (at least on the surface).

Popularization
Main article:
Popular mathematics
Popular mathematics is the act of presenting mathematics without technical terms.
[193]
Presenting mathematics may be hard since the general public suffers from
mathematical anxiety
and mathematical objects are highly abstract.
[194]
However, popular mathematics writing can overcome this by using applications or cultural links.
[195]
Despite this, mathematics is rarely the topic of popularization in printed or televised media.

A famous list of 23
open problems
, called "

[208]
This list has achieved great celebrity among mathematicians,
[209]
and, as of 2022
, at least thirteen of the problems (depending how some are interpreted) have been solved.
[208]
A new list of seven important problems, titled the "
Millennium Prize Problems
", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the
Riemann hypothesis
, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward.

Shoreditch Town Hall
is a municipal building in
Shoreditch
, London. It is a Grade II
listed building
.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
In the mid-19th century, the vestry board decided to procure a
vestry
hall for the Parish of
St. Leonard's
; the site they selected had been occupied by some old
almshouses
known as "Fuller's Hospital".
[2]
[3]
The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the Chairman of the
Metropolitan Board of Works
,
John Thwaites
, in 1865.
[2]
The new building, the eastern section of the current complex, was designed by Caesar Augustus Long in the
Italianate style
, built by John Perry of
Stratford
and completed in 1866.
[1]
The design involved a symmetrical main
frontage
with five bays facing onto
Old Street
; the central section featured a
tetrastyle
porch
with
Ionic order
columns on the ground floor; there were windows interspersed with
Corinthian order
columns and
pilasters
on the first floor and a large
pediment
above.
[1]
At the time it was described as "the grandest vestry hall in London".
[2]
The building was embellished with symbolic statuary alluding to the borough motto, "More Light, More Power", which refer to the council's aim of generating its own electricity to power local industry.
[4]
On 12 November 1888 the inquest into the death of
Mary Jane Kelly
, the last victim of the
Whitechapel murders
, was held in the building.
[5]
Following the creation of the
Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch
in 1899, the building was extended westwards by adding a tower and an extra three bays to the five bays that already existed.
[1]
The foundation stone for the extension was laid by the mayoress, Mrs Sarah Ellen Kershaw, on 9 September 1901.
[6]
[7]
The design by William Hunt created a monumental structure which was completed in 1902.
[1]
Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber and mayor's parlour at the rear of the building on the ground floor and a large assembly hall in the east part of the building on the first floor.
[8]
[9]
After a major fire in the assembly hall, that part of the building was rebuilt to the designs of
Alfred Cross
in 1904.
[1]
An additional wing to the south of the main building was added in 1938.
[8]
The building ceased to be the local seat of government after the formation of the
London Borough of Hackney
in 1965.
[10]
It was subsequently used as a venue for boxing and other events and in 1969 Ulric Regis died from brain injuries soon after being outpointed by
Joe Bugner
at the town hall.
[11]
In the 1990s the assembly hall served as a night club featuring
trance music
hosted by the
Whirl-Y-Gig
dance club
.
[2]
After a period of neglect, it passed into the ownership of the newly formed Shoreditch Town Hall Trust in 1997.
[2]
Following an extensive restoration programme, the building reopened as an events venue in 2004
[2]
and, after a further programme of works, it re-opened as an arts and events venue in 2012.

) is the capital and
largest city
of
England
and the
United Kingdom
, with a population of around 8.8 million.
[1]
[note 1]
It stands on the
River Thames
in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km)
estuary
down to the
North Sea
and has been a major settlement for nearly two millennia.
[9]
The
City of London

[11]
the name "London" also refers to the
metropolis
around this core, historically split among the
counties
of
Middlesex
,
Essex
,
Surrey
,
Kent
, and
Hertfordshire
,
[12]
which since 1965 has largely comprised
Greater London

[34]
Toponymy
Main article:
Etymology of London
London
is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the
Latinised
form
Londinium
.
[35]
Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources:
Latin
(usually
Londinium
),
Old English
(usually
Lunden
), and
Welsh
(usually
Llundein
), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from
Common Brythonic
; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as
*
Londonjon
or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as
Londinium
and borrowed into Old English.
[36]
Until 1889, the name "London" applied officially only to the
City of London
, but since then it has also referred to the
County of London
and to
Greater London
.
[37]
History
Main article:
History of London
For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of London
.
Prehistory
In 1993, remains of a
Bronze Age
bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from
Vauxhall Bridge
.
[38]
Two of the timbers were
radiocarbon dated
to 1750-1285 BC.
[38]
In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800-4500 BC,
[39]
were found on the Thames's south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge.
[40]
Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground
River Effra
flows into the Thames.
[40]
Roman London
Main article:
Londinium
Reconstruction drawing of
Londinium
in 120 AD
Despite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the
Romans
around 47 AD,
[2]
about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.
[41]
This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the
Iceni
tribe led by
Queen Boudica
stormed it and burnt it to the ground.
[42]
The next planned incarnation of
Londinium
prospered, superseding
Colchester
as the principal city of the
Roman province
of
Britannia
in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of about 60,000.
[43]
Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London
The
Lancastrian
siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a
Yorkist
sally.
With the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of
Londinium
was effectively abandoned, although
Roman civilisation
continued around
St Martin-in-the-Fields
until about 450.
[44]
From about 500, an
Anglo-Saxon
settlement known as
Lundenwic
developed slightly west of the old Roman city.
[45]
By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated
Viking
assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.
[46]
The
Vikings
applied
Danelaw
over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to
Chester
as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the
Viking
incursions formally agreed by the
Danish
warlord
,
Guthrum
and the
West Saxon
king
Alfred the Great
in 886. The
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
records that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of
Lundenwic
and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.
[47]
By the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England.
Westminster Abbey
, rebuilt in
Romanesque
style by King
Edward the Confessor
, was one of the grandest churches in Europe.
Winchester
had been the capital of
Anglo-Saxon England
, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of
Frank Stenton
: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a
national capital
."
[48]
Middle Ages
Westminster Abbey
, as seen in this painting (by
Canaletto
, 1749), is a
World Heritage Site
and one of London's oldest and most important buildings.
After winning the
Battle of Hastings
,
William, Duke of Normandy
was crowned
King of England
in newly completed
Westminster Abbey
on Christmas Day 1066.
[49]
William built the
Tower of London
, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants.
[50]
In 1097,
William II
began building
Westminster Hall
, close by the abbey of the same name. It became the basis of a new
Palace of Westminster
.
[51]
In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at
Westminster
, although the royal treasury came to rest in the
Tower
. While the
City of Westminster
developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the
City of London
, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the
Corporation of London
. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.
[52]
With the
Black Death
in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third of its population.
[53]
London was the focus of the
Peasants' Revolt
in 1381.
[54]
London was a centre of England's
Jewish population
before their
expulsion
by
Edward I
in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.
[55]
In 1264 during the
Second Barons' War
,
Simon de Montfort
's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.
[56]
Early modern
Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.
During the
Tudor period
, the
Reformation
produced a gradual shift to
Protestantism
. Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.
[57]
In 1475, the
Hanseatic League
set up a main trading base (
kontor
) of England in London, called the
Stalhof
or
Steelyard
. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of
Lübeck
,
Bremen
and
Hamburg
sold the property to
South Eastern Railway
.
[58]
Woollen
cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the
Low Countries
.
[59]
Yet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of
north-west Europe
. The commercial route to Italy and the
Mediterranean
was normally through
Antwerp
and over the
Alps
; any ships passing through the
Strait of Gibraltar
to or from England were likely to be Italian or
Ragusan
. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity.
[60]
The
Royal Exchange
was founded.
[61]
Mercantilism
grew and monopoly traders such as the
East India Company
were founded as trade expanded to the
New World
. London became the main
North Sea
port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.
[57]
In the 16th century,
William Shakespeare
and his contemporaries lived in London during
English Renaissance theatre
. Shakespeare's
Globe Theatre
was constructed in 1599 in
Southwark
. Stage performances came to a halt in London when
Puritan
authorities
shut down the theatres
in the 1640s and 1650s.
[62]
The ban on theatre was lifted during
the Restoration
in 1660, and London's oldest operating theatre,
Drury Lane
, opened in 1663 in what is now the
West End
theatre district.
[63]
By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on
James I
in Westminster, in the
Gunpowder Plot
of 5 November 1605.
[64]
In 1637, the government of
Charles I
attempted to reform administration in the London area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the
Liberties of London
, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation's "The Great Refusal", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the
City
.
[65]
In the
English Civil War
, the majority of Londoners supported the
Parliamentary
cause. After an initial advance by the
Royalists
in 1642, culminating in the battles of
Brentford
and
Turnham Green
, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the
Lines of Communication
. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.
[66]
The fortifications failed their only test when the
New Model Army
entered London in 1647,
[67]
and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.
[68]
The
Great Fire of London
destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.
London was
plagued
by disease in the early 17th century,
[69]
culminating in the
Great Plague
of 1665-1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.
[69]
The
Great Fire of London
broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.
[70]
Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath
Robert Hooke
.
[71]
In 1708
Christopher Wren
's masterpiece,
St Paul's Cathedral
, was completed. During the
Georgian era
, new districts such as
Mayfair
were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in
South London
. In the east, the
Port of London
expanded downstream. London's development as an international
financial centre
matured for much of the 18th century.
[72]
In 1762,
George III
acquired
Buckingham House
, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime,
[73]
and the
Bow Street Runners
were established in 1750 as a professional police force.
[74]
Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.
[75]
Coffee-houses
became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing
literacy
and development of the
printing press
made news widely available, with
Fleet Street
becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the
Royal Navy
became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the
Corn Laws
in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.
[76]
Late modern and contemporary
With the onset of the
Industrial Revolution
in Britain, an unprecedented growth in
urbanisation
took place, and the number of
High Streets
(the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew.
[77]
[78]
London was the world's
largest city
from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare).
[79]
In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as
Harding, Howell & Co.
—one of the first
department stores
—located on
Pall Mall
, the streets had scores of
street sellers
.
[77]
London's overcrowded conditions led to
cholera
epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.
[80]
Rising
traffic congestion
led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The
Metropolitan Board of Works
oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the
London County Council
was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.
[81]
From the early years of the 20th century onwards,
teashops
were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain, with
Lyons
, who opened the first of their
chain
of teashops in
Piccadilly
in 1894, leading the way.
[82]
The tearooms, such as the
Criterion
in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement.
[83]
The city was the target of many attacks during the
suffragette bombing and arson campaign
, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as
Westminster Abbey
and
St Paul's Cathedral
bombed.
[84]

London was
bombed by the Germans
in the
First World War
, and during the
Second World War
,
the Blitz
and other bombings by the German
Luftwaffe
killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.
[85]
The tomb of
the Unknown Warrior
, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920.
[86]
The Cenotaph
, located in
Whitehall
, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the
National Service of Remembrance
held annually on
Remembrance Sunday
, the closest Sunday to 11 November.
[87]
The
1948 Summer Olympics
were held at the original
Wembley Stadium
, while London was still recovering from the war.
[88]
From the 1940s, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from
Commonwealth
countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,
[89]
making London one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the
Festival of Britain
was held on the
South Bank
.
[90]
The
Great Smog
of 1952 led to the
Clean Air Act 1956
, which ended the "
pea soup fogs
" for which London had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the "Big Smoke".
[91]
Starting mainly in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for worldwide
youth culture
, exemplified by the
Swinging London
sub-culture associated with the
King's Road
,
Chelsea
and
Carnaby Street
.
[92]
The role of trendsetter revived in the
punk
era.
[93]
In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new
Greater London Council
was created.
[94]
During
The Troubles
in Northern Ireland, London was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army
.
[95]
These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the
Old Bailey bombing
.
[95]
Racial inequality was highlighted by the
1981 Brixton riot
.
[96]
Greater London's population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.
[97]
The principal ports for London moved downstream to
Felixstowe
and
Tilbury
, with the
London Docklands
area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the
Canary Wharf
development. This was born out of London's increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s.
[98]
Located about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central London, the
Thames Barrier
was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the
North Sea
.
[99]
The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, leaving London with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the
Greater London Authority
.
[100]
To mark the 21st century, the
Millennium Dome
,
London Eye
and
Millennium Bridge
were constructed.
[101]
On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the
2012 Summer Olympics
, as the first city to stage the
Olympic Games
three times.
[34]
On 7 July 2005, three
London Underground
trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a
series of terrorist attacks
.
[95]
In 2008,
Time
named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as
Nylonkong
, hailing them as the world's three most influential
global cities
.
[102]
In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939.
[103]
During the
Brexit referendum
in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the
European Union
, but most London constituencies voted for remaining.
[104]
However, Britain's
exit from the EU
in early 2021 only marginally weakened London's position as an international financial centre.
[105]
On 6 May 2023, the
coronation of Charles III
and his wife, Camilla, as king and queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, took place at
Westminster Abbey
, London.
[106]
Administration
Local government
Main articles:
Local government in London
,
History of local government in London
, and
List of heads of London government
Arms of the Corporation of the City of London
[107]
The administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the
Greater London Authority
(GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.
[108]
The GLA consists of two elected components: the
mayor of London
, who has
executive powers
, and the
London Assembly
, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm
Transport for London
(TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues.
[109]
The headquarters of the GLA is
City Hall
, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been
Sadiq Khan
, the first
Muslim
mayor of a major Western capital.
[110]
The mayor's
statutory planning
strategy is published as the
London Plan
, which was most recently revised in 2011.
[111]
The local authorities are the councils of the 32
London boroughs
and the
City of London Corporation
.
[112]
They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation,
social services
, local roads and refuse collection.
[113]
Certain functions, such as
waste management
, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009-2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).
[114]
The
London Fire Brigade
is the
statutory
fire and rescue service
for Greater London, run by the
London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority
. It is the third largest fire service in the world.
[115]
National Health Service
ambulance services
are provided by the
London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust
, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.
[116]
The
London Air Ambulance
charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required.
Her Majesty's Coastguard
and the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution
operate on the
River Thames
, which is under the jurisdiction of the
Port of London Authority
from
Teddington Lock
to the sea.
[117]
National government
10 Downing Street
, official residence of the
Prime Minister
London is the seat of the
Government of the United Kingdom
. Many government departments, as well as the
prime minister's
residence at
10 Downing Street
, are based close to the
Palace of Westminster
, particularly along
Whitehall
.
[118]
There are 73 members of
Parliament
(MPs) from London; As of December 2019
, 49 are from the
Labour Party
, 21 are
Conservatives
, and three are
Liberal Democrats
.
[119]
The ministerial post of
minister for London
was created in 1994 and as of 2020 is held by
Paul Scully
.
[120]
Policing and crime
Main article:
Crime in London
Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the
City of London
, is provided by the
Metropolitan Police
("The Met"), overseen by the mayor through the
Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime
(MOPAC).
[121]
The Met is also referred to as
Scotland Yard
after the location of its original headquarters in a road called
Great Scotland Yard
in Whitehall. The City of London has its own police force - the
City of London Police
.
[122]
First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the
custodian helmet
has been called a "cultural icon" and a "symbol of British law enforcement".
[123]
Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue
police telephone box
(basis for the
TARDIS
in
Doctor Who
) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK.
[124]
Headquarters of
MI6
, the UK's foreign intelligence service, at the
SIS Building
. Scenes featuring
James Bond
(the fictional MI6 agent) have been filmed here.
The
British Transport Police
are responsible for police services on
National Rail
,
London Underground
,
Docklands Light Railway
and
Tramlink
services.
[125]
The
Ministry of Defence Police
is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.
[126]
The UK's domestic counter-intelligence service (
MI5
) is headquartered in
Thames House
on the north bank of the River Thames, and the foreign intelligence service (
MI6
) is headquartered in the
SIS Building
on the south bank.
[127]
Crime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at
Local Authority
and
Ward
level.
[128]
In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.
[129]
Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved.
[130]
However, the murder rate in London is much lower than
other major cities
around the world.
[131]
Geography
Main article:
Geography of London
Scope
Satellite view of London in June 2018
London, also known as
Greater London
, is one of nine
regions of England
and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The
City of London
at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the
Corporation of London
resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its
suburbs
, causing "London" to be defined several ways.
[132]
Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the
London post town
, in which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.
[133]
The London telephone
area code
(020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater London boundary has been
aligned to the M25 motorway
in places.
[134]
Further urban expansion is now prevented by the
Metropolitan Green Belt
, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined
Greater London Urban Area
. Beyond this is the vast
London commuter belt
.
[135]
Greater London is split for some purposes into
Inner London
and
Outer London
,
[136]
and by the River Thames into
North
and
South
, with an informal
central London
area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally the original
Eleanor Cross
at
Charing Cross
near the junction of
Trafalgar Square
and
Whitehall
, are about
.
[137]
Status
Within London, both the City of London and the
City of Westminster
have
city status
and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are
counties for the purposes of lieutenancies
.
[138]
The area of
Greater London
includes areas that are part of the
historic counties
of
Middlesex
,
Kent
,
Surrey
,
Essex
and
Hertfordshire
.
[139]
London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed by statute or in written form.
[note 5]
Its status as a capital was established by
constitutional convention
, which means its status as
de facto
capital is a part of the
UK's uncodified constitution
. The capital of England was moved to London from
Winchester
as the
Palace of Westminster
developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the
royal court
, and thus the political capital of the nation.
[142]
More recently, Greater London has been defined as a
region of England
and in this context is known as
London
.
[143]
Topography
London from
Primrose Hill
Greater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km
2
) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km
2
). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km
2
) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km
2
).
[144]
Modern London stands on the
Thames
, its primary geographical feature, a
navigable
river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The
Thames Valley
is a
flood plain
surrounded by gently rolling hills including
Parliament Hill
,
Addington Hills
, and
Primrose Hill
. Historically London grew up at the
lowest bridging point
on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive
marshlands
; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.
[145]
Since the
Victorian era
the Thames has been extensively
embanked
, and many of its London
tributaries
now flow
underground
. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.
[146]
The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in
high water
level caused by
climate change
and by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles as a result of
post-glacial rebound
.

Precipitation totals in inches
London has a temperate
oceanic climate
(
Köppen
:
Cfb
). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at
Kew
. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.
[148]
The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).
[149]
The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, which is half the annual rainfall of
New York City
.
[150]
Despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually. However, London is vulnerable to
climate change in the United Kingdom
, and there is increasing concern among
hydrological
experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.
[151]
Temperature extremes in London range from 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to −17.4 °C (0.7 °F) at Northolt on 13 December 1981.
[152]
[153]
Records for
atmospheric pressure
have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.
[154]
Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the
2003 European heat wave
, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.
[155]
A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths.
[156]
A previous temperature of 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard.
[157]
Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.
[158]
However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.
[159]
Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable
urban heat island
effect,
[160]
making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.

Areas
Main articles:
List of areas of London
and
London boroughs
Places within London's vast urban area are identified using area names, such as
Mayfair
,
Southwark
,
Wembley
, and
Whitechapel
. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or
former boroughs
.
[171]
The
West End theatre
district in 2016
Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater London has been divided into 32
London boroughs
in addition to the ancient City of London.
[172]
The City of London is the main financial district,
[173]
and
Canary Wharf
has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the
Docklands
to the east.
The
West End
is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.
[174]
West London
includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.
[175]
The average price for properties in
Kensington and Chelsea
is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.
[176]
[177]
The
East End
is the area closest to the original
Port of London
, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.
[178]
The surrounding
East London
area saw much of London's early industrial development; now,
brownfield
sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the
Thames Gateway
including the
London Riverside
and
Lower Lea Valley
, which was developed into the
Olympic Park
for the
2012 Olympics and Paralympics
.

Architecture
Main articles:
Architecture of London
,
List of tallest buildings and structures in London
, and
List of demolished buildings and structures in London
The
Tower of London
, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078
London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the
National Gallery
, are constructed from
Portland stone
. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white
stucco
or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the
Great Fire
of 1666, these being a few trace
Roman
remains, the
Tower of London
and a few scattered
Tudor
survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period
Hampton Court Palace
.
[179]
Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by
Christopher Wren
, neoclassical financial institutions such as the
Royal Exchange
and the
Bank of England
, to the early 20th century
Old Bailey
courthouse and the 1960s
Barbican Estate
. The 1939
Battersea Power Station
by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of
Victorian architecture
, most notably
St. Pancras
and
Paddington
.
[180]
The density of London varies, with high employment density in the
central area
and
Canary Wharf
, high residential densities in
inner London
, and lower densities in
Outer London
.
The east wing public façade of
Buckingham Palace
was built between 1847 and 1850; it was remodelled to its present form in 1913.
Trafalgar Square
and its fountains, with
Nelson's Column
on the right
The Monument
in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the
Great Fire of London
, which originated nearby.
Marble Arch
and
Wellington Arch
, at the north and south ends of
Park Lane
, respectively, have royal connections, as do the
Albert Memorial
and
Royal Albert Hall
in
Kensington
.
Nelson's Column
(built to commemorate
Admiral Horatio Nelson
) is a nationally recognised monument in
Trafalgar Square
, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow
London stock brick
.
[181]
In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as
30 St Mary Axe
(dubbed "The Gherkin"),
Tower 42
, the
Broadgate Tower
and
One Canada Square
, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and
Canary Wharf
. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct
protected views
of
St Paul's Cathedral
and other historic buildings.
[182]
This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of London since 1937.
[182]
Nevertheless, there are
a number of tall skyscrapers
in central London, including the 95-storey
Shard London Bridge
, the
tallest building in the United Kingdom
and Western Europe.
[183]
Other notable modern buildings include
The Scalpel
,
20 Fenchurch Street
(dubbed "The Walkie-Talkie"), the former
City Hall
in
Southwark
, the
Art Deco
BBC Broadcasting House
plus the
Postmodernist
British Library
in
Somers Town
/
Kings Cross
and
No 1 Poultry
by
James Stirling
. The
BT Tower
stands at 620 feet (189 m) and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the
Millennium Dome
, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called
the O
2
Arena
.

Natural history
The
London Natural History Society
suggests that London is "one of the World's Greenest Cities" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the
tidal Thames
supports 120 species of fish.
[185]
They state that over 60 species of bird nest in
central London
and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's
wetland
areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38
Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs), two
national nature reserves
and 76
local nature reserves
.
[186]
Amphibians
are common in the capital, including
smooth newts
living by the
Tate Modern
, and
common frogs
,
common toads
,
palmate newts
and
great crested newts
. On the other hand, native reptiles such as
slowworms
,
common lizards
,
barred grass snakes
and
adders
, are mostly only seen in
Outer London
.
[187]
A fox on Ayres Street,
Southwark
,
South London
Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000
red foxes
, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square kilometre) of London. Other mammals found in
Greater London
are
hedgehog
,
brown rat
, mice,
rabbit
,
shrew
,
vole
, and
grey squirrel
.
[188]
In wilder areas of Outer London, such as
Epping Forest
, a wide variety of mammals are found, including
European hare
,
badger
,
field
,
bank
and
water vole
,
wood mouse
,
yellow-necked mouse
,
mole
, shrew, and
weasel
, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead
otter
was found at The Highway, in
Wapping
, about a mile from the
Tower Bridge
, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.
[189]
Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest:
soprano
,
Nathusius'
and
common pipistrelles
,
common noctule
,
serotine
,
barbastelle
,
Daubenton's
,
brown long-eared
,
Natterer's
and
Leisler's
.
[190]
Herds of
red
and
fallow deer
roam freely within much of
Richmond
and
Bushy Park
. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.
[191]
Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of
melanistic
, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near
Theydon Bois
.
Muntjac deer
are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.

Population density map
The 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were
foreign-born
,
[194]
making it among the cities with the
largest immigrant population
in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.
[195]
The population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter.
[196]
London's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011,
[29]
while its wider
metropolitan area
had a population of 12-14 million, depending on the definition used.
[197]
According to
Eurostat
, London is the second
most populous
metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991-2001.
[198]
The region covers 610 square miles (1,579 km
2
), giving a population density of 13,410 inhabitants per square mile (5,177/km
2
)
[144]
more than ten times that of any other
British region
.
[199]
In population terms, London is the 19th
largest city
and the 18th
largest metropolitan
region.
[200]
Age structure and median age
Children younger than 14 constituted 20.6% of the population in Outer London in 2018, and 18% in Inner London. The 15-24 age group was 11.1% in Outer and 10.2% in Inner London, those aged 25-44 years 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London, those aged 45-64 years 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively. Those aged 65 and over are 13.6% in Outer London, but only 9.3% in Inner London.
[201]
The
median age
of London's residents in 2018 was 36.5, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3.

[202]
The history of
African presence
extends back to the
Roman period
.
[203]
As of 2007, one fifth of primary school students across London were from ethnic minorities.
[204]
Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4% were White, 19.8% Asian, 19% Black, 10.8% Mixed and 4% another ethnic group.
[205]
In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000.
[206]
Figures from the
Office for National Statistics
show that in 2021
, London's foreign-born population was 3,346,000 (35%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.
[207]
The 2011 census showed that 36.7% of
Greater London
's population were born outside the UK.
[208]
Estimates by the
Office for National Statistics
indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London from July 2009 to June 2010 were born in India, Poland, Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.
[209]
In the 2021 census 40.6% of London residents were foreign-born.
[194]
The ethnic demographics of the 2021 census were reported as 53.8% White, with White British reported at 36.8%, Asian or Asian British at 20.8%, Black or Black British at 13.5%, mixed 5.7% and other at 6.3%.

List of churches in London
According to the
2011 Census
, the largest religious groupings were
Christians
(48.4%), followed by those of no religion (20.7%),
Muslims
(12.4%), no response (8.5%),
Hindus
(5.0%), Jews (1.8%),
Sikhs
(1.5%),

[211]
London has traditionally been Christian, and has a
large number of churches
, particularly in the City of London. The well-known
St Paul's Cathedral
in the City and
Southwark Cathedral
south of the river are
Anglican
administrative centres,
[212]
while the
Archbishop of Canterbury
, principal bishop of the
Church of England
and worldwide
Anglican Communion
, has his main residence at
Lambeth Palace
in the
London Borough of Lambeth
.
[213]
St Paul's Cathedral
, the seat of the
Bishop of London
The
BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London
is the second-largest
Hindu temple
in England and Europe.
Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between
St Paul's
and
Westminster Abbey
.
[214]
The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby
Westminster Cathedral
, the largest
Roman Catholic
cathedral in
England and Wales
.
[215]
Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.
[216]
Notable mosques include the
East London Mosque
in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the
London Central Mosque
on the edge of
Regent's Park
[217]
and the
Baitul Futuh
of the
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community
. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy
Middle-Eastern
Arab Muslims based themselves around
Mayfair
, Kensington and
Knightsbridge
in West London.
[218]
[219]
[220]
There are large
Bengali Muslim
communities in the eastern boroughs of
Tower Hamlets
and
Newham
.
[221]
Large Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of
Harrow
and
Brent
, the latter hosting what was until 2006
[222]
Europe's largest
Hindu temple
,
Neasden Temple
.
[223]
London is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the
BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London
. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.
[224]
The majority of
British Jews
live in London, with notable Jewish communities in
Stamford Hill
,
Stanmore
,
Golders Green
,
Finchley
,
Hampstead
,
Hendon
and
Edgware
, all in
North London
.
Bevis Marks Synagogue
in the
City of London
is affiliated to London's historic
Sephardic
Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years.
Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue
has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe.
[225]
The
London Jewish Forum
was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.
[226]
Accents
Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells of
St Mary-le-Bow
church was considered to be a true
Cockney
.
[227]
Cockney
is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by
working-class
and
lower-middle class
Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.
[228]
Some features of Cockney include,
Th
-fronting
(pronouncing "th" as "f"), "th" inside a word is pronounced with a "v",
H
-dropping
, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent
drops the "r"
after a vowel.
[229]
John Camden Hotten, in his
Slang Dictionary
of 1859, makes reference to Cockney "use of a peculiar slang language" (
Cockney rhyming slang
) when describing the
costermongers
of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the
home counties
.
[230]
Estuary English
is an intermediate accent between Cockney and
Received Pronunciation
.
[231]
It is widely spoken by people of all classes.
[232]
Multicultural London English
(MLE) is a
multiethnolect
becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.
[233]
Received Pronunciation
(RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for
British English
.
[234]
It has no specific geographical correlate,
[235]
although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.
[236]
It is mainly spoken by
upper-class
and
upper-middle class
Londoners.
[237]
Economy

Economy of London
The
City of London
, one of the largest financial centres in the world
[238]
London's
gross regional product
in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of
UK GDP
.
[239]
London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m
2
of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m
2
of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.
[240]
London is the world's most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report.
[241]
As of 2015
the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion.
[242]
The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.
[243]
On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities.
[244]
City of London
The
London Stock Exchange

The
Royal Exchange
in 1886
London's finance industry is based in the
City of London
and
Canary Wharf
, the two major
business districts
. London is one of the pre-eminent
financial centres
of the world as the most important location for international finance.
[245]
London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century.
[72]
The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.
[76]
This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.
[246]
[247]
The
Bank of England
, established in 1694, is the model on which most modern central banks are based.
By the mid-19th century, London was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world's trade was financed in British currency.
[248]
Still, as of 2016
London tops the world rankings on the
Global Financial Centres Index
(GFCI),
[249]
and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.
[250]
London's largest industry is finance, and its
financial exports
make it a large contributor to the UK's
balance of payments
. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.
[251]
Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the
financial crisis of 2007-2008
. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.
[252]
Along with
professional services
headquarters, the City of London is home to the
Bank of England
,
London Stock Exchange
, and
Lloyd's of London
insurance market.
[253]
Over half the UK's top 100 listed companies (the
FTSE 100
) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of
Fortune 500
companies have offices in London.
[254]
In a 1992 report commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, Sir
Adrian Cadbury
, chairman of his family's confectionery company
Cadbury
, produced the
Cadbury Report
, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of
corporate governance
around the world.

national newspapers
, including
The Times
, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term
Fleet Street
(where most national newspapers operated) remains a
metonym
for the British national press. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion.

Transport in London
and
Infrastructure in London
Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,
[271]
but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the
London Overground
network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by
Transport for London
(TfL).
[109]
The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the
London Passenger Transport Board
or
London Transport
was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the
Mayor of London
.
[272]
Aviation
Main article:
Airports of London
Heathrow Airport
is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic (
Terminal 5
C is pictured).
London is a major international air transport hub with the
busiest city airspace in the world
. Eight airports use the word
London
in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally,
various other airports
also serve London, catering primarily to
general aviation
flights.
Heathrow Airport
, in
Hillingdon
, West London, was for many years the
busiest airport in the world
for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier,
British Airways
.
[273]
In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.
[274]
Gatwick Airport
, south of London in
West Sussex
, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of
easyJet
, the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.
[275]
Stansted Airport
, north-east of London in
Essex
, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of
Ryanair
, the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.
[276]
Luton Airport
, to the north of London in
Bedfordshire
, is used by several budget airlines (especially easyJet and
Wizz Air
) for short-haul flights.
[277]
London City Airport
, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in
Newham
, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable
business jet
traffic.
[278]
Southend Airport
, east of London in
Essex
, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.
[279]
In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.
[280]
Rail
Underground and DLR
The
London Underground
is the world's oldest and third-longest
rapid transit
system.
Opened in 1863, the
London Underground
, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest
metro
system in the world.
[281]
[282]
The system serves
272 stations
, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the
City and South London Railway
, which opened in 1890.
[283]
Over four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.
[284]
An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the
2012 Summer Olympics
.
[285]
The
Docklands Light Railway (DLR)
, which opened in 1987, is a second, more
local metro system
using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the
Docklands
,
Greenwich
and
Lewisham
.
Suburban
There are
368 railway stations
in the
London Travelcard Zones
on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into
eighteen terminal stations
, with the exception of the
Thameslink
trains connecting
Bedford
in the north and
Brighton
in the south via
Luton
and
Gatwick
airports.
[286]
London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—
Waterloo
, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes
Waterloo East
station) each year.
[287]
Clapham Junction
is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges.
[288]
With the need for more rail capacity, the
Elizabeth Line
(also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022.
[289]
It is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the
Home Counties
with a branch to
Heathrow Airport
.
[290]
It was Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.
[291]
Inter-city and international
St Pancras International
is the main terminal for high-speed
Eurostar
and
High Speed 1
services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city
East Midlands Railway
services.
London is the centre of the
National Rail
network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.
[292]
King's Cross station
and
Euston station
, both in London, are the starting points of the
East Coast Main Line
and the
West Coast Main Line
- the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns.
[293]
The Flying Scotsman
is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service,
Flying Scotsman
, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.
[294]
Some international railway services to
Continental Europe
were operated during the 20th century as
boat trains
. The opening of the
Channel Tunnel
in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing
Eurostar
services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link
St. Pancras International
with
Lille
,
Calais
, Paris,
Disneyland Paris
, Brussels,
Amsterdam
and other European tourist destinations via the
High Speed 1
rail link and the
Channel Tunnel
.
[295]
The first
high-speed domestic
trains started in June 2009 linking
Kent
to London.
[296]
There are plans for a
second high speed line
linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.
[297]
Buses, coaches and trams
A
New Routemaster
(which replaced the
AEC Routemaster
) entered service in 2012. The red double-decker bus is an emblematic symbol of London.
London's
bus network
runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops.
[298]
In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year.
[299]
Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.
[300]
London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world
[301]
and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.
[302]
London's coach hub is
Victoria Coach Station
, opened in 1932. Nationalised in 1970 and subsequently purchased by London Transport which then became
Transport for London
, Victoria Coach Station has over 14 million passengers a year and provides services across the UK and continental Europe.
[303]
London has a modern tram network, known as
Tramlink
. It has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.
[304]
Since June 2008,
Transport for London
has completely owned and operated Tramlink.
[305]
Cable car
London's first and to date only cable car is the
London Cable Car
, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the Thames and links
Greenwich Peninsula
with the
Royal Docks
in the east of the city. It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times.
[306]
Cycling
Main article:
Cycling in London
Santander Cycle Hire, near
Victoria
in Central London
In the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,
[307]
meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.
[308]
Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a
bicycle hire scheme
in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.
[309]
Port and river boats
The
Port of London
, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.
[258]
Most of this cargo passes through the
Port of Tilbury
, outside the boundary of Greater London.
[258]
London has river boat services on the Thames known as
Thames Clippers
, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.
[310]
At major piers including
Canary Wharf
,
London Bridge City
, Battersea Power Station and
London Eye
(Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.
[311]
The
Woolwich Ferry
, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the
North
and
South Circular
Roads.
[312]
Roads
Although the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The
inner ring road
(around the city centre), the
North
and
South Circular
roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the
M25
, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into
inner London
. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 miles (188 km) long.
[313]
The
A1
and
M1
connect London to
Leeds
, and
Newcastle
and
Edinburgh
.
[314]
The
hackney carriage
(black cab) is a common sight on London streets. Although traditionally black, this is not a requirement with some painted in other colours or bearing advertising.
The
Austin Motor Company
began making
hackney carriages
(London taxis) in 1929, and models include
Austin FX3
from 1948,
Austin FX4
from 1958, with more recent models
TXII
and
TX4
manufactured by
London Taxis International
. The BBC states, "ubiquitous black cabs and red double-decker buses all have long and tangled stories that are deeply embedded in London's traditions".
[315]
London is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).
[316]
In 2003, a
congestion charge
was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.
[317]
Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.
[318]
Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars.

While London has been an LGBT tourism destination, after
homosexuality was decriminalised
in England in 1967 gay bar culture became more visible, and from the early 1970s
Soho
(and in particular
Old Compton Street
) became the centre of the
London LGBT community
.
[365]
G-A-Y
, previously based at the
Astoria
, and now

[366]
Wider British cultural movements have influenced LGBT culture: for example, the emergence of
glam rock
in the UK in the early 1970s, via
Marc Bolan
and
David Bowie
, saw a generation of teenagers begin playing with the idea of androgyny, and the West End musical
The Rocky Horror Show

"

by the

(
Bill Drummond

), was released as a limited edition single in
Israel

in November 1993. The song was an amalgam of

Originally intended for release when "world peace [is] established" (i.e. "never" and in "no formats"),
[1]
the Israeli release was made "In acknowledgement of the recent brave steps taken by the Israeli Government and the
Palestinian Liberation Organisation
(PLO)".
[2]
Said Bill Drummond: "Our idea was to create awareness of peace in the world. Because we were worried it would be interpreted by the public as an attempt by

Plans to broadcast the track from the main stage of the 1993

ESP-r main menu and an exemplar model
ESP-r
is a research-oriented
open-source
building performance simulation
software.
[1]
[2]
ESP-r can model heat flow in thermal zones, fluid flow using networks or CFD, electrical power flow, moisture flow, contaminant flow, hygrothermal and fluid flow in HVAC systems, as well as visual and acoustic performance aspects within a modeled energy system/building.
It was initially developed in 1974, as Joe Clarke's PhD research at the University of Strathclyde, and has been since extended by researchers from several countries.
[3]
[4]
ESP-r was made available in 2002 in the public domain subject to the
GNU Public License
.
ESP-r is designed to work on
Unix
, but it can run on Windows using
Windows Subsystem for Linux
(or in any other operational system using a virtual machine). The current ESP-r archivist is Professor Joseph Clarke, of the University of Strathclyde.
ESP-r`s holistic nature, flexibility, and range of features enable a well-informed user to optimize the energy and environmental performance of a building and/or associated energy systems.
[5]
The user experience provided by ESP-r, however, cannot be compared to the one provided by commercial software. ESP-r learning curve is steep, but there is a growing amount of training material available online.
[6]
[7]
ESP-r has been extensively validated.
[8]
[9]
Among other projects, ESP-r was part of BESTEST,
[10]
an
initiative that created a benchmark for quality assessment of energy simulation software. This benchmark was later incorporated on ASHRAE Standard 140 - Method of Test for Evaluating Building Performance Simulation Software.

Simply Music
is a
music education
organization licensing teachers at over 700 locations in twelve countries and serving an online self-study student community in 128 countries.
Australian
music educator
Neil Moore
founded it on the core belief that all humans are naturally musical. Simply Music offers programs for students from birth through old age, with the stated goal that "students acquire and retain music as a lifelong companion." Simply Music patterns its approach after primary language acquisition, where speaking comes first.
[1]
In this it shares some philosophical ground with other developmental approaches like
Kodály
,
Orff Schulwerk
, and the
Suzuki Method
.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Neil Moore began constructing the Simply Music method in the late 20th century while teaching
piano
to a young
blind
boy. Since Moore was unsure how to apply traditional methods of reading music, he wondered if an approach, based on his own childhood relationship to music, might work. From about age 3 or 4, Moore would hear music and naturally visualize it as shapes and patterns. At age 7, when his piano teacher would play the songs he was to learn, Moore recognized those same shapes and patterns across the keyboard. Decades later, Moore described his approach to this blind student, giving the boy a way to feel the shapes and patterns on the instrument. Moore continued this process, and within a few months his new student was playing a range of blues, popular, and classical pieces. The boy began using the same approach to teach the songs to his four-year-old sister, who was also blind.
[3]
This spurred Moore to begin testing his ideas more widely, and he found this approach natural and successful for students of all ages and abilities. Other piano teachers began learning from Moore. When he could no longer personally train them all, Moore founded the Simply Music organization and developed a remote
certification
program that is currently available to teachers in twelve countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
[4]
Later, Simply Music expanded to support the development of
early childhood music education
, and also worked with Karen Nisenson to create
, an adaptive piano curriculum for children with
special needs
.
[5]
Philosophy
[
edit
]
Simply Music's founding premise is similar to
Shin'ichi Suzuki
’s claim that any child can learn
music
.
[6]
But Simply Music extends the concept, like researchers
and
, who write that it is our "birthright" to "be able to communicate and interact musically with others."
[7]
In the same degree, Simply Music declares musicality essential to human nature. Adherents identify many everyday activities as fundamentally musical because these activities thoughtlessly fall into patterns of
rhythm
and
pitch
. As examples they cite speaking, walking, and brushing teeth. Simply Music seeks both to draw on and to nurture this natural ability by distilling musical concepts into simple patterns.
[8]
Students use these patterns to begin playing songs in their first lessons. This method is modeled after primary
language acquisition
, where learners begin by speaking. Many other music education approaches—including
Orff Schulwerk
and the
Dalcroze
,
Kodály
, and
Suzuki
methods—engage students physically first and teach
notation
later.
[2]
The complete Simply Music program aims to teach music for generalists, who may or may not later choose a specialty such as performing
classical music
, playing
keyboard
in a band, or
accompanying
soloists
or theater performers. The program attempts to prepare students with a solid music background that can take them where they choose. The primary goal is for students to keep music in their life, most often for
relaxation
and enjoyment at home or with family and friends. As such, Simply Music includes a wide variety of musical
genres
, such as
classical
,
blues
,
jazz
, and
popular
.
[1]
Simply Music does not focus on mastering classical
concert
performance
technique
. Instead, Simply Music teachers encourage students to play
expressively
and comfortably, without tension.
[9]
Pedagogy
[
edit
]
The Simply Music approach contrasts with many other music learning methods, where the ability to play music depends first on learning to read music. Moore terms these traditional methods
reading-based
and his approach
playing-based
.
[10]
The core playing-based piano pieces are presented in the Foundation Program, a series of 9 levels of 7-10 songs each. The pieces are designed to provide experience with many musical styles and genres, to build students’ physical dexterity at the piano, and to give students hands-on familiarity with fundamental musical concepts.
[9]
Alongside the Foundation Program, and often using concepts from the Foundation pieces, students learn
arrangement
,
improvisation
,
composition
,
chord
-reading, and
theory
. Teachers are required to present all these programs, as they are considered essential to a well-rounded music education.
[9]
Simply Music maintains that their approach—based on learning to recognize patterns inherent in music—is distinct from learning by rote or by ear. Students learn through patterns on the keyboard, in their fingers, and in the music itself. Students learn the physical shape that a melody line or a chord forms in the hand or on the keyboard. For example, a basic
triad
such as
D Major
is seen as a triangle shape on the keyboard, with the two white notes forming the base and the black note at the top. Musical patterns include concepts like
repeated rhythmic
or
melodic patterns
(or
sequences
), melodic sentences,
musical forms
such as ABA, and chord progressions like the
12-bar blues
.
[9]
Experience with these concepts provides a foundation for learning note-reading during the second year. Simply Music first teaches rhythm notation, followed by pitch reading, and then applies these skills to pieces written in standard music notation. Students learn to read pitches by identifying intervals, rather than individual note-names. This is known as an
intervallic
approach.
[9]
Simply Music also uses what they call
learning, meaning that students write music as an integral part of learning to read music.
[8]
As students further expand their musicianship, they move into the Development Program, which applies their musical understanding and note-reading skills to increasingly complex written music. Lessons continue to include arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. At this phase, students also explore their own musical interests in more depth.
Simply Music piano may be taught in either shared or private lessons.
[9]
The early childhood program is taught in small groups.
[11]
Early childhood
[
edit
]
Simply Music partners with an affiliate young childhood music education program, Lynn Kleiner's
.
[1]
Music Rhapsody is a music and movement program for infants through age five. Early childhood music education specialist
based the program on the
Orff Schulwerk
philosophy. In keeping with its roots, the program focuses on learning through play and addresses each stage of child development. The program immerses children in music-making through diverse songs, instruments, movement, puppets and visuals. By building a foundation in music and incorporating Simply Music repertoire, it prepares students to transition into the piano program.
[11]
Materials
[
edit
]
All the Simply Music programs use a variety of multimedia materials to provide
multisensory learning
. Simply Music Piano students use written music as well as other written materials to remember assignments and track their progress. Video recordings distill the main points of every lesson. Audio recordings help students become familiar with the songs, refine style and technique, and develop ensemble skills. Teacher training is also presented through multimedia materials.
[9]
Early childhood Music Rhapsody students use a wide variety of specially designed instruments along with movement materials, puppets, and visuals. The program also provides audio recordings for students and teachers, as well as video support for teachers.
[11]
Repertoire
[
edit
]
The Simply Music Piano repertoire covers a broad range of styles, including classical, contemporary, jazz, blues, gospel, and other styles from around the world. In addition to the core Foundation pieces, students learn arrangements of each piece, along with accompaniments, teacher-selected written pieces, student-choice songs, and student compositions.
A student’s personal repertoire is called their Playlist. A Playlist is considered essential, partly because a large and varied repertoire helps facilitate lifelong musical engagement. Also, each new piece builds on musical concepts from earlier pieces.
[9]
The Music Rhapsody curriculum centers around
children’s music
, both traditional and contemporary, and also introduces many styles including classical, jazz, blues, and international music.

Donald Clark Johnston
(2 December 1894 - 13 September 1918) was an
English
first-class
cricketer
and
British Army
officer.
The son of John and Frances Johnston, he was born in
Shanghai
in December 1894. He was educated at
Malvern College
, before going up to
Brasenose College, Oxford
.
[1]
While studying at Oxford, Johnston played
first-class cricket
for
Oxford University
in 1914, making two appearances against
G. J. V. Weigall's XI
at
Oxford
and
L. G. Robinson's XI
at
Attleborough
.
[2]
Johnston served in the
British Army
during the
First World War
, being commissioned as a temporary
second lieutenant
in the
Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)
in October 1914.
[3]
By October 1917, he was a temporary
captain
, a rank which he relinquished having ceased to command a battalion.
[4]
He was again made an acting captain in January 1918,
[5]
before relinquishing the rank once more in July 1918.
[6]
He had been promoted to the full rank of
lieutenant
the previous month.
[7]
Johnston was seriously wounded during an assault on Hill 158 on 30 July 1918 as part of the
Second Battle of the Marne
. He died of his wounds on 13 September 1918 at
Beugneux
in France.

Legal procedure in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
Nagana szlachectwa
(
Latin
:
'Vituperatio nobilitatis'
), literally
reprobation/reprimand/censure of nobility
, also translated by
Norman Davies
as
Test of Nobility
[1]
was a legal procedure of the
revocation of nobility
in the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
.
Descripiton
[
edit
]
Due to the absence of formalized heraldry laws and lineage in early Poland, nobility of a person was tested in a regular court.
[2]
The confirmation of nobility was based on calling for a certain number of witnesses. In Poland this was in accordance with the 1633 statute,
[3]
in Lithuania by Chapter 3, Article 22 of the
1588 Statute
.
[4]
The latter demanded two witnesses each from the maternal and paternal side. The penalty for perjury was being stripped of one's own szlachta status, by the Constitution of 1601.
[5]
In case of the successful
nagana
, the accuser earned up to half of the property of the accused,
[6]
with the other half going to the state.
[7]
The justice was highly prone to miscarriage, in particular, to abusive
ennoblement
[8]
Therefore, this procedure was gradually restricted in various ways. After 1581, the procedures took place before either the
Crown Tribunal
or the
Lithuanian Tribunal
.
[9]
Norman Davies conjectures that this practice was among the factors leading to the establishment of a unique Polish practice of
heraldic clans
.
[1]
It is also asserted that this practice led to development of extensive personal archiving and archive research among Polish nobility.

The
United Mine Workers of America
(
UMW
or
UMWA
) is a North American
labor union
best known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada.
[1]
Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and
universal health care
.
[2]
By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners. The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. However it was responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.
[3]
The UMW was founded in
Columbus, Ohio
, on January 25, 1890, with the merger of two old labor groups, the
Knights of Labor
Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive Miners Union.
[4]
Adopting the model of the union was initially established as a three-pronged labor tool: to develop mine safety; to improve mine workers' independence from the mine owners and the
company store
; and to provide miners with collective bargaining power.
After passage of the
National Recovery Act
in 1933 during the
Great Depression
, organizers spread throughout the United States to organize all coal miners into labor unions. Under the powerful leadership of
John L. Lewis
, the UMW broke with the American Federation of Labor and set up its own federation, the
CIO
(Congress of Industrial Organizations). Its organizers fanned out to organize major industries, including automobiles, steel, electrical equipment, rubber, paint and chemical, and fought a series of battles with the AFL. The UMW grew to 800,000 members and was an element in the
New Deal Coalition
supporting Democratic President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
. Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 and left the CIO, leaving the UMW increasingly isolated in the labor movement. During World War II the UMW was involved in a series of major strikes and threatened walkouts that angered public opinion and energized pro-business opponents. After the war, the UMW concentrated on gaining large increases in wages, medical services and retirement benefits for its shrinking membership, which was contending with changes in technology and declining mines in the East.

Development of the Union
[
edit
]
The UMW was founded at
Columbus City Hall
in
Columbus, Ohio
, on January 25, 1890, by the merger of two earlier groups, the
Knights of Labor
Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive Miners Union.
[5]
It was modeled after the
American Federation of Labor
(AFL). The Union's emergence in the 1890s was the culmination of decades of effort to organize mine workers and people in adjacent occupations into a single, effective negotiating unit. At the time coal was one of the most highly sought natural resources, as it was widely used to heat homes and to power machines in industries. The coal mines were a competitive and dangerous place to work. With the owners imposing reduced wages on a regular basis,
[2]
in response to fluctuations in pricing, miners sought a group to stand up for their rights.
Early efforts
[
edit
]
American Miners' Association
The first step in starting the union was the creation of the
American Miners' Association
. Scholars credit this organization with the beginning of the labor movement in the United States.
[2]
The membership of the group grew rapidly. "Of an estimated 56,000 miners in 1865, John Hinchcliffe claimed 22,000 as members of the AMA.
[2]
In response, the mine owners sought to stop the AMA from becoming more powerful. Members of the AMA were fired and blacklisted from employment at other mines. After a short time the AMA began to decline, and eventually ceased operations.
Workingman's Benevolent Association
Another early labor union that arose in 1868 was the
Workingmen's Benevolent Association
. This union was distinguished as a labor union for workers mining
anthracite
coal. The laborers formed the WBA to help improve pay and working conditions. The main reason for the success of this group was the president,
John Siney
, who sought a way both to increase miners benefits while also helping the operators earn a profit. They chose to limit the production of anthracite to keep its price profitable. Because the efforts of the WBA benefited the operators, they did not object when the union wanted to take action in the mines; they welcomed the actions that would secure their profit. Because the operators trusted the WBA, they agreed to the first written contract between miners and operators.
[2]
As the union became more responsible in the operators' eyes, the union was given more freedoms. As a result, the health and spirits of the miners significantly improved.
[2]
The WBA could have been a very successful union had it not been for
Franklin B. Gowen
. In the 1870s Gowen lead the
Reading Railroad
, and bought several coal mines in the area. Because he owned the coal mines and controlled the means of transporting the coal, he was able to slowly destroy the labor union. He did everything in his power to produce the cheapest product and to ensure that non-union workers would benefit. As conditions for the miners of the WBA worsened, the union broke up and disappeared.
[2]
After the fall of the WBA, miners created many other small unions, including the Workingman's Protective Association (WPA) and the Miner's National Association (MNA). Although both groups had strong ideas and goals, they were unable to gain enough support and organization to succeed. The two unions did not last long, but provided greater support by the miners for a union which could withstand and help protect the workers' rights.
[2]
1870s
[
edit
]
Although many labor unions were failing, two predominant unions arose that held promise to become strong and permanent advocates for the miners. The main problem during this time was the rivalry between the two groups. Because the National Trade Assembly #135, better known as the
Knights of Labor
, and the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers were so opposed to one another, they created problems for miners rather than solving key issues.
National Trade Assembly #135
[
edit
]
The Great Seal of the Knights of Labor
This union was more commonly known as the Knights of Labor and began around 1870 in the
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
area. The main problem with the Knights of Labor was its secrecy.
[2]
The members kept very private their affiliation and goals of the Knights of Labor. Because both miners and operators could become members, there was no commonality to unite the members. Also, the union did not see strikes as a means to attain rights. To many people of the time, a strike was the only way that they believed they would be heard.
The Knights of Labor tried to establish a strong and organized union, so they set up a system of local assemblies, or LAs. There were two main types of LAs, trade and mixed, with the trade LA being the most common. Although this system was put into place to create order, it did the opposite. Even though there were only two categories of LAs, there were many sub-divisions. For the most part it was impossible to tell how many trade and mixed LAs there were at a given time. Local assemblies began to arise and fall all around, and many members began to question whether or not the Knights of Labor was strong enough to fight for the most important issue of the time, achieving an eight-hour work day.
[2]
National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers
[
edit
]
This Union was formed by members of the Knights of Labor who realized that a secret and unified group would not turn into a successful union. The founders,
John McBride
,
Chris Evans
and
Daniel McLaughlin
, believed that creating an eight-hour work day would not only be beneficial for workers, but also as a means to stop
overproduction
, which would in turn help operators. The union was able to get cooperation from operators because they explained that the miners wanted better conditions because they felt as if they were part of the mining industry and also wanted the company to grow. But in order for the company to grow, the workers must have better conditions so that their labor could improve and benefit the operators.
The union's first priority was to get a fair weighing system within the mines. At a conference between the operators and the union, the idea of a new system of scaling was agreed upon, but the system was never implemented. Because the union did not deliver what it had promised, it lost support and members.
[2]
1880s
[
edit
]
During this time, the rivalry between the two unions increased and eventually led to the formation of the UMW. The first of many arguments arose after the 1886 joint conference. The Knights of Labor did not want the NTA #135 to be in control, so they went against a lot of their decisions. Also, because the Knights of Labor were not in attendance at the conference, they were not able to vote against actions which they thought detrimental to gain rights for workers. The conference passed resolutions requiring the Knights of Labor to give up their secrecy and publicize material about its members and locations. The National Federation held another conference in 1887 attended by both groups. But it was unsuccessful in gaining agreement by the groups as to the next actions to take. In 1888,
Samuel Gompers
was elected as President of the National Federation of Miners, and
George Harris
first vice president.
[6]
Throughout 1887-1888 many joint conferences were held to help iron out the problems that the two groups were having. Many leaders of each groups began questioning the morals of the other union. One leader,
William T. Lewis
, thought there needed to be more unity within the union, and that competition for members between the two groups was not accomplishing anything. As a result of taking this position, he was replaced by John B. Rae as president of the NTA #135. This removal did not stop Lewis however; he got many people together who had been also thrown out of the Knights of Labor for trying to belong to both parties at once, along with the National Federation, and created the National Progressive Union of Miners and Mine Laborers (NPU).
Although the goal of the NPU in 1888 was ostensibly to create unity between the miners, it instead drew a stronger line distinguishing members of the NPU against those of the NTA #135. Because of the rivalry, miners of one labor union would not support the strikes of another, and many strikes failed. In December 1889, the president of the NPU set up a joint conference for all miners. John McBride, the president of NPU, suggested that the Knights of Labor should join the NPU to form a stronger union. John B. Rae reluctantly agreed and decided that the merged groups would meet on January 22, 1890.
[2]
Constitution of the Union: The Eleven Points
[
edit
]
When the union was founded, the values of the UMWA were stated in the preamble:
We have founded the United Mine Workers of America for the purpose of ... educating all mine workers in America to realize the necessity of unity of action and purpose, in demanding and securing by lawful means the just fruits of our toil.
[2]
The UMWA constitution listed eleven points as the union's goals:
Payment of a salary commensurate with the dangerous work conditions. This was one of the most important points of the constitution.
Payment to be made fairly in legal tender, not with company scrip.
Provide safe working conditions, with operators to use the latest technologies in order to preserve the lives and health of workers.
Provide better ventilation systems to decrease
black lung disease
, and better drainage systems.
Enforce safety laws and make it illegal for mines to have inadequate roof supports, or contaminated air and water in the mines.
Limit regular hours to an eight-hour work day.
End child labor, and strictly enforce the
child labor law
.
Have accurate scales to weigh the coal products, so workers could be paid fairly. Many operators had altered scales that showed a lighter weight of coal than actually produced, resulting in underpayment to workers. Miners were paid per pound of coal that they produced.
Payment should be made in legal tender.
Establish unbiased public police forces in the mine areas that were not controlled by the operators. Many operators hired private police, who were used to harass the mine workers and impose company power. In company towns, the operators owned all the houses and controlled the police force; they could arbitrarily evict workers and arrest them unjustly.
The workers reserved the right to strike, but would work with operators to reach reasonable conclusions to negotiations.

John Llewellyn Lewis
John L. Lewis
(1880-1969) was the highly combative UMW president who thoroughly controlled the union from 1920 to 1960. A major player in the labor movement and national politics, in the 1930s he used UMW activists to organize new unions in autos, steel and rubber. He was the driving force behind the founding of the
Congress of Industrial Organizations
(CIO). It established the
United Steel Workers of America
and helped organize millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s.
After resigning as head of the CIO in 1941, he took the Mine Workers out of the CIO in 1942 and in 1944 took the union into the
American Federation of Labor
(AFL). Lewis was a Republican, but he played a major role in helping
Franklin D. Roosevelt
win re-election with a landslide in 1936, but as an isolationist supported by Communist elements in the CIO, Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 on anti-Nazi foreign policy. (Following the 1939
German-Soviet pact
of nonaggression, the
Comintern
had instructed communist parties in the West to oppose any support for nations at war with Nazi Germany.
[7]
)
Lewis was a brutally effective and aggressive fighter and strike leader who gained high wages for his membership while steamrolling over his opponents, including the United States government. Lewis was one of the most controversial and innovative leaders in the history of labor, gaining credit for building the industrial unions of the CIO into a political and economic powerhouse to rival the AFL, yet was widely hated as he called nationwide coal strikes damaging the American economy in the middle of World War II. His massive leonine head, forest-like eyebrows, firmly set jaw, powerful voice, and ever-present scowl thrilled his supporters, angered his enemies, and delighted cartoonists. Coal miners for 40 years hailed him as the benevolent dictator who brought high wages, pensions and medical benefits, and damn the critics.
[8]
Achievements
[
edit
]
An
eight-hour work day
was gained in 1898.
[9]
The first ideas of this demand were outlined in point six of the constitution.
The union achieved collective bargaining rights in 1933.
[9]
Health and retirement benefits for the miners and their families were earned in 1946.
[9]
In 1969, the UMWA convinced the
United States Congress
to enact the landmark
Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act
, which provided compensation for miners suffering from
Black Lung Disease
.
Relatively high wages for unionized miners by the early 1960s.
[10]
List of strikes
[
edit
]
The union's history has numerous examples of strikes in which members and their supporters clashed with company-hired strikebreakers and government forces. The most notable include:
1890s
[
edit
]
Morewood massacre
- April 3, 1891, in
Morewood, Pennsylvania
. A crowd of mostly immigrant strikers were fired on by deputized members of the 10th Regiment of the National Guard. At least ten strikers were killed and dozens injured.
Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike of 1894
- April 21, 1894. This nationwide strike was called when the union was hardly four years old. Many of the workers salaries had been cut by 30%
[2]
and with the demand for coal down during the recession, workers were desperate for work. The national guard was mobilized in several states to prevent or control violent clashes between strikers and strike breakers. The workers intended to strike for three weeks, hoping that this would produce a demand for coal and their wages would increase with its rising price. But, many union miners did not wish to cooperate with this plan and did not return to work at all. The union appeared weak. Other workers did not go out on strike, and with the demand low, they were able to produce sufficient coal. By being efficient in the mines, the operators saw no need to increase the wages of all the workers, and did not seem to care if the strike would end.
By June the demand for coal began to increase, and some operators decided to pay the workers their original salaries before the wage cut. However, not all demands across the country were met, and some workers continued to strike. The young union suffered damage in this uneven effort. The most important goal of the 1894 strike was not the restoration of wages, but rather the establishment of the UMWA as a cooperation at a national level.
Lattimer Massacre
- September 10, 1897. 19 miners were killed by police in
Lattimer, Pennsylvania
, during a march in support of unions.
Battle of Virden
- October 1898. This was part of the larger
mine wars
that established Illinois as the leading union state in the country, and a reason that

is buried at
Mount Olive, Illinois

Coal miners in
Hazleton, Pennsylvania
, in 1905
The five-month
Coal Strike of 1902
, led by the United Mine Workers and centered in eastern Pennsylvania, ended after direct intervention of President
Theodore Roosevelt
as a neutral arbitrator.
1903 Colorado coal strike - October 1903. The United Mine Workers conducted a strike in Colorado, called in October 1903 by President Mitchell, and lasting into 1904. The strike, while overshadowed by a simultaneous strike conducted by the
Western Federation of Miners
among hard rock miners in the
Cripple Creek District
, contributed to the labor struggles in Colorado. These came to be known as the Colorado Labor Wars.

During the United Mine Workers effort, operators directed their private forces to attack and beat traveling union officers and organizers, which ultimately helped to break the strike. These beatings were a mystery until publication of
The Pinkerton Labor Spy
(1907) by
Morris Friedman
, which revealed that the UMWA had been infiltrated by
labor spies
from the
Pinkerton agency
.
[11]
1908 Alabama coal strike
- June-August 1908. Notable because the 18,000 UMWA-organized strikers, more than half of those working in the
Birmingham District
, were racially integrated. That fact helped galvanize political opposition to the strikers in the segregated state. The governor used the Alabama State Militia to end the work stoppage. The union adopted racial segregation of workers in Alabama in order to reduce the political threat to the organization.
[12]
[13]
[14]
Westmoreland County Coal Strike
- 1910-1911, a 16-month coal strike in
Pennsylvania
led largely by
Slovak
immigrant miners, this strike involved 15,000 coal miners. Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.
Colorado Coalfield War
- September 1913-December 1914. A frequently violent strike against the
John D. Rockefeller Jr.
-
Colorado Fuel and Iron
company. Many strikers and opposition were killed before the violent reached a peak following the April 20, 1914
Ludlow Massacre
. An estimated 20 people, including women and children, were killed by armed police, hired guns, and
Colorado
National Guardsmen
who broke up a tent colony formed by families of miners who had been evicted from company-owned housing. The strike was partially led by
John R. Lawson
, a UMWA organizer and saw the participation of famed activist
Mother Jones
. The UMWA purchased part of
Ludlow
site and constructed the
Ludlow Monument
in commemoration of those who died.
Hartford coal mine riot
- July 1914. The surface plant of the Prairie Creek coal mine was destroyed, and two non-union miners murdered by union miners and sympathizers. The mine owners sued the local and national organizations of the United Mine Workers Union. The national UMWA was found not complicit, but the local was judged culpable of encouraging the rioters, and made to pay US$2.1 million.
[15]
"KEEPING WARM"
Los Angeles Times
November 22, 1919
United Mine Workers coal strike of 1919
- November 1, 1919. Some 400,000 members of the United Mine Workers went on strike on November 1, 1919, although Attorney General
A. Mitchell Palmer
had invoked the
Lever Act
, a wartime measure criminalizing interference with the production or transportation of necessities, and obtained an injunction against the strike on October 31.
[16]
[17]
The coal operators smeared the strikers with charges that Russian communist leaders
Lenin
and
Trotsky
had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press repeated those claims.
[18]
Matewan, West Virginia
- May 19, 1920. 12 men were killed in a gunfight between town residents and the
Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency
, hired by mine owners. Director
John Sayles
directed a feature film,
Matewan
, based on these events.
The 'Redneck War' - 1920-21. Generally viewed as beginning with the Matewan Massacre, this conflict involved the struggle to unionize the southwestern area of West Virginia. It led to the march of 10,000 armed miners on the county seat at
Logan
. In the
Battle of Blair Mountain
, miners fought state militia, local police, and mine guards. These events are depicted in the novels
Storming Heaven
(1987) by Denise Giardina and
Blair Mountain
(2005) by Jonathan Lynn.
1920 Alabama coal strike
, a lengthy, violent, expensive and fruitless attempt to achieve union recognition in the coal mines around
Birmingham
left 16 men dead; one black man was
lynched
.
1922 UMW General coal strike
, On April 1, 1922, 610,000 mine workers struck nationwide, shutting down the majority of operations within the country.
Herrin massacre
occurred in June 1922 in
Herrin, Illinois
. 19 strikebreakers and 2 union miners were killed in mob action between June 21-22, 1922.
1922-1925 Nova Scotia strikes
[
edit
]
WPA poster
In the 1920s, about 12,000 Nova Scotia miners were represented by the UMWA.
[19]
These workers lived in very difficult economic circumstances in
company towns
. The
Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation
, also known as the British Empire Steel Corporation, or BESCO, controlled most coal mines and every steel mill in the province.
[19]
BESCO was in financial difficulties and repeatedly attempted to reduce wages and
bust the union
.
Led by
J. B. McLachlan
, miners struck in 1923, and were met by locally and provincially-deployed troops. This would eventually lead to the federal government introducing legislation limiting the civil use of troops.
[19]
In 1925 BESCO announced that it would not longer give credit at their
company stores
and that wages would be cut by 20%. The miners responded with a strike. This led to violence with
company police
firing on strikers, killing miner
William Davis
, as well as the looting and arson of company property.
[19]
This crisis led to the Nova Scotia government acting in 1937 to improve the rights of all wage earners, and these reforms served as a model across Canada, at both provincial and federal levels.
[19]
The Brookside Strike
[
edit
]
In the summer of 1973, workers at the
Duke Power
-owned Eastover Mining Company's Brookside Mine and Prep Plant in
Harlan County, Kentucky
, voted to join the union. Eastover management refused to sign the contract and the miners went on strike. Duke Power attempted to bring in replacement non-union workers or "
scabs
" but many were blocked from entering the mine by striking workers and their families on the picket line. Local judge F. Byrd Hogg was a coal operator himself and consistently ruled for Eastover. During much of the strike the mine workers' wives and children joined the picket lines. Many were arrested, some hit by baseball bats, shot at, and struck by cars. One striking miner, Lawrence Jones, was shot and killed by a
Strikebreaker
.
Three months after returning to work, the national UMWA contract expired. On November 12, 1974, 120,000 miners nationwide walked off the job. The nationwide strike was bloodless and a tentative contract was achieved three weeks later. This opened the mines and reactivated the railroad haulers in time for Christmas. These events are depicted in the documentary film
Harlan County, USA
.
The Pittston strike
[
edit
]
The
Pittston Coal strike
of 1989-1990 began as a result of a withdrawal of the Pittston Coal Group also known as the
Pittston Company
from the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association
(BCOA) and a refusal of the Pittston Coal group to pay the health insurance payments for miners who were already retired. The owner of the Pittston company at the time, Paul Douglas, left the BCOA because he wanted to be able to produce coal seven days a week and did not want his company to pay the fee for the insurance.
The Pittson company was seen as having inadequate safety standards after the
Buffalo Creek flood
of 1972 in which 125 people were killed.
[4]
The company also was very financially unstable and in debt. The mines associated with the company were located mostly in Virginia, with mines also in West Virginia and Kentucky.
On 31 January 1988 Douglas cut off retirement and health care funds to about 1500 retired miners, widows of miners, and disabled miners.
[4]
To avoid a strike, Douglas threatened that if a strike were to take place, that the miners would be replaced by other workers. The UMW called this action unjust and took the Pittston company to court.
Miners worked from January 1988 to April 1989 without a contract. Tension in the company grew and on April 5, 1989, the workers declared a strike.
[4]
Many months of both violent and nonviolent strike actions took place. On 20 February 1990 a settlement was finally reached between the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company.
Internal conflict
[
edit
]
The union's history has sometimes been marked by internal strife and corruption, including the 1969 murder of
Joseph Yablonski
, a reform candidate who lost a race for union president against incumbent
W. A. Boyle
, along with his wife and 25-year-old daughter. Boyle was later convicted of ordering these murders.
The killing of Yablonski resulted in the birth of a pro-democracy movement called the "
Miners for Democracy
" (MFD) which swept Boyle and his regime out of office, and replaced them with a group of leaders who had been most recently rank and file miners.
Led by new president
Arnold Miller
, the new leadership enacted a series of reforms which gave UMWA members the right to elect their leaders at all levels of the union and to ratify the contracts under which they worked.
Decline of labor unionism in mining
[
edit
]
Decreased faith in the UMW to support the rights of the miners caused many to leave the union. Coal demand was curbed by competition from other energy sources. The main cause of the decline in the union during the 1920s and 1930s was the introduction of more efficient and easily produced machines into the coal mines.
[2]
In previous years, less than 41% of coal was cut by the machines. However, by 1930, 81% was being cut by the machines and now there were machines that could also surface mine and load the coal into the trucks.
[2]
With more machines that could do the same labor, unemployment in the mines grew and wages were cut back. As the problems grew, many people did not believe that the UMW could ever
become as powerful as it was before the start of the war.
[2]
The decline in the union began in the 1920s and continued through the 1930s.
[2]
Slowly the membership of the UMWA grew back up in numbers, with the majority in
District 50
, a catch-all district for workers in fields related to coal mining, such as the chemical and energy industries.  This district gained organizational independence in 1961, and then fell into dispute with the remainder of the union, leading in 1968 to its expulsion.
[20]
In the 1970s and after
[
edit
]
Diana Baldwin
and
Anita Cherry
are believed to have been the first women to work inside an American coal mine, and were the first women to work inside a mine who were members of the UMW. They began that work in 1973 in
Jenkins, Kentucky
.
[21]
However, more pervasive were hiring practices discriminatory against women. The superstition that a woman even entering a mine was bad luck and results in disaster was pervasive among male miners.
[22]
In 1978 a discrimination complaint was filed by the
Coal Employment Project
, a women's advocacy organization, against 153 coal companies. This action was based upon
Executive Order 11246
signed in 1965 by U.S.
President Lyndon Johnson
, which bars sex discrimination by companies with federal contracts. The complaint called for the hiring of one woman for every three inexperienced men until women constituted 20 percent of the workforce. This legal strategy was successful. Almost 3,000 women were hired by the close of 1979 as underground miners.
[23]
However, a general decline in union effectiveness characterized the 1970s and 1980s, leading to new kinds of activism, particularly in the late 1970s. Workers saw their unions back down in the face of aggressive management.
[24]
Other factors contributed to the decline in unionism generally and UMW specifically. The coal industry was not prepared economically to deal with such a drop in demand for coal. Demand for coal was very high during World War II, but decreased dramatically after the war, in part due to competition from other energy sources. In efforts to improve air quality, municipal governments started to ban the use of coal as household fuel. The end of wartime price controls introduced competition to produce cheaper coal, putting pressure on wages.
[2]
These problems—perceived weakness of the unions, loss of control over jobs, drop in demand, and competition—decreased the faith of miners in their union.
By 1998 the UMW had about 240,000 members, half the number that it had in 1946.
[2]
As of the early 2000s, the union represents about 42 percent of all employed miners.
[2]
Affiliation with other unions
[
edit
]
At some point before 1930, the UMW became a member of the
American Federation of Labor
.
[25]
The UMW leadership was part of the driving force to change the way workers were organized, and the UMW was one of the charter members when the new
Congress of Industrial Organizations
was formed in 1935. However, the AFL leadership did not agree with the philosophy of industrial unionization, and the UMW and nine other unions that had formed the CIO were kicked out of the AFL in 1937.
In 1942, the UMW chose to leave the CIO,
[26]
and, for the next five years, were an independent union. In 1947, the UMW once again joined the AFL, but the remarriage was a short one, as the UMW was forced out of the AFL in 1948, and at that point, became the largest non-affiliated union in the United States.
In 1982,
Richard Trumka
was elected the leader of the UMW. Trumka spent the 1980s healing the rift between the UMW and the now-conjoined
AFL-CIO
(which was created in 1955 with the merger of the AFL and the CIO). In 1989, the UMW was again taken into the fold of the large union umbrella.
[26]
Political involvement
[
edit
]
United Mine Workers meeting with Congressman
Tom O'Halleran
in 2020
Throughout the years, the UMW has taken political stands and supported candidates to help achieve union goals.
The United Mine Workers ran candidate
Frank Henry Sherman
under the union banner in the
1905 Alberta general election
. Sherman's candidacy was driven to appeal to the significant population of miners working in the camps of southern Alberta.
[27]
He finished second in the riding of
Pincher Creek
.
The biggest conflict between the UMW and the government was while
Franklin Roosevelt
was president of the United States and John L. Lewis was president of the UMW. Originally, the two worked together well, but, after the 1937 strike of United Automobile Workers against General Motors, Lewis stopped trusting Roosevelt, claiming that Roosevelt had gone back on his word. This conflict led Lewis to resign as
CIO
president. Roosevelt repeatedly won large majorities of the union votes, even in 1940 when Lewis took an isolationist position on Europe, as demanded by far-left union elements. Lewis denounced Roosevelt as a power-hungry war monger, and endorsed Republican
Wendell Willkie
.
[28]
[29]
[30]
The tension between the two leaders escalated during World War II. Roosevelt in 1943 was outraged when Lewis threatened a major strike to end anthracite coal production needed by the war effort. He threatened government intervention and Lewis retreated.
[31]
The UMW represents West Virginia coal miners and endorsed
Joe Manchin
(D-W.Va.) in the
2018 United States Senate election in West Virginia
.
[32]
In 2021 the union urged him to revisit his opposition to President Biden's
Build Back Better Plan
, noting that the bill includes an extension of a fund that provides benefits to coal miners suffering from black lung disease, which expires at the end of the year. The UMWA also touted tax incentives that encourage manufacturers to build facilities in coalfields that would employ thousands of miners who lost their jobs.
"For those and other reasons, we are disappointed that the bill will not pass," Cecil Roberts, the union's president said. "We urge Senator Manchin to revisit his opposition to this legislation and work with his colleagues to pass something that will help keep coal miners working, and have a meaningful impact on our members, their families, and their communities."

[35]

Judy Devlin
(later
Judy Hashman
) (born 22 October 1935 in
Winnipeg
,
Manitoba
) is a former
badminton
player who won more major international titles than any other player of her era.
Devlin began playing badminton with her Irish-born father
Frank Devlin
when she was seven in the Baltimore, Maryland region of the U.S.A. where her family had settled. Under her father's tutelage she developed a badminton game notable for its power, accuracy, and consistency. After dominating U.S. junior competition she won her first (adult) U.S. championship event, women's doubles, with her older sister
Susan Devlin
in 1953. This marked the beginning of the run of success listed below.  She married Dick Hashman in 1960, living in England thereafter and eventually becoming a British citizen.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
Competing before the establishment of an official
world championships
for individual players and before badminton's entry into the
Olympic Games
, Devlin won 86 national and international titles. Among these are 31 titles in the
USA
, 8 titles in
Germany
, 7 titles in
Canada
, 4 titles in
the Netherlands
, 4 titles in
Sweden
, 3 titles in
Ireland
, 3 titles in Jamaica, 2 titles in
Scotland
, and a combined 19 titles in
All England Open
and
English National
competition. She played on U.S.
Uber Cup
teams that won three successive world championships (1957, 1960, 1963). In 1972 she won 2 titles (team and women's doubles) at the
European Badminton Championships
. She retired in 1973.
From 1954 to 1967 Devlin dominated the women's singles event at the
U.S. Open
, winning 12 titles in 14 years, including 8 consecutive championships from 1956 to 1963.
Judy Devlin is the third most successful player ever in the
All England Badminton Championships
, with 17 titles, 10 of them in women's singles and 7 in women's doubles.
She appeared as a castaway on the
BBC Radio
programme
Desert Island Discs
on 21 March 1970,
[2]
and was inducted into the
Badminton Hall of Fame
in 1997, together with her father. She has also been inducted into the U. S. Badminton Hall of Fame and the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame.

"Europe" as defined by the International Monetary Fund.
Europe
is a
continent
[a]
comprising the westernmost
peninsulas
of
Eurasia
,
[12]
[13]
located entirely in the
Northern Hemisphere
and mostly in the
Eastern Hemisphere
. It shares the continental landmass of
Afro-Eurasia
with both
Africa
and
Asia
. It is bordered by the
Arctic Ocean
to the north, the
Atlantic Ocean
to the west, the
Mediterranean Sea
to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be
separated from Asia
by the
watershed
of the
Ural Mountains
, the
Ural River
, the
Caspian Sea
, the
Greater Caucasus
, the
Black Sea
and the waterways of the
Turkish straits
.
[14]
Europe covers about 10.18 million km
2
(3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the
seven-continent model
). Politically, Europe is divided into about
fifty sovereign states
, of which
Russia
is the
largest
and
most populous
, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a
total population
of about 745 million (about 10% of the
world population
) in 2021; the
third-largest
after Asia and Africa.
[2]
[3]
The
European climate
is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at
latitudes
along which the climate in Asia and
North America
is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.
European culture is the root of
Western civilisation
, which traces its lineage back to
ancient Greece
and
ancient Rome
.
[15]
[16]
The
fall of the Western Roman Empire
in 476 CE and the related
Migration Period
marked the end of Europe's
ancient history
, and the beginning of the
Middle Ages
. The
Italian Renaissance
began in
Florence
and
spread to the rest of the continent
, bringing a renewed interest in
humanism
, exploration,
art
, and
science
which contributed to the beginning of the
modern era
. Since the
Age of Discovery
, led by
Spain
and
Portugal
, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world.
Between the 16th and 20th centuries,
European powers colonised
at various times the
Americas
, almost all of Africa and
Oceania
, and the majority of Asia.
The
Age of Enlightenment
, the
French Revolution
, and the
Napoleonic Wars
shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The
Industrial Revolution
, which began in
Great Britain
at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in
Western Europe
and eventually the wider world. Both
world wars
began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the
Soviet Union
and the United States took prominence.
[17]
During the
Cold War
, Europe was divided along the
Iron Curtain
between
NATO
in the West and the
Warsaw Pact
in the East, until the
Revolutions of 1989
, the
fall of the Berlin Wall
, and the
dissolution of the Soviet Union
.
The
European Union
(EU) and the
Council of Europe
are two important
international organisations
aiming to represent the European continent on a political level. The Council of Europe was founded in 1948 with the idea of unifying Europe
[18]
to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. Further
European integration
by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate
supranational
political entity based on a system of
European law
that lies between a
confederation
and a
federation
.
[19]
The EU originated in Western Europe but has been
expanding eastward
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the
euro
, and participate in the
European single market
and a
customs union
. A large bloc of countries, the
Schengen Area
, have also abolished internal border and immigration controls.
Regular popular elections
take place every five years within the EU; they are considered to be the second largest democratic elections in the world after
India's
.
Name

Europa (consort of Zeus)
First
map of the world
according to
Anaximander
(6th century BCE)
In classical
Greek mythology
,
Europa
(
Ancient Greek
:
Εὐρώπη
,
Eurṓpē
) was a
Phoenician
princess. One view is that her name derives from the
Ancient Greek
elements
εὐρύς
(
eurús
) 'wide, broad', and
ὤψ
(
ōps
,
gen.
ὠπός
,
ōpós
) 'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite
Eurṓpē
would mean 'wide-gazing' or 'broad of aspect'.
[20]
[21]
[22]
[23]
Broad
has been an
epithet
of Earth herself in the reconstructed
Proto-Indo-European religion
and the poetry devoted to it.
[20]
An alternative view is that of
Robert Beekes
, who has argued in favour of a Pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from
eurus
would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and localities such as that of
Europos
in
ancient Macedonia
.
[24]
There have been attempts to connect
Eurṓpē
to a Semitic term for
west
, this being either
Akkadian
erebu
meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or
Phoenician
'ereb
'evening, west',
[25]
which is at the origin of
Arabic
maghreb
and
Hebrew
ma'arav
.
Martin Litchfield West
stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor",
[26]
while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable.
[24]
Most major world languages use words derived from
Eurṓpē
or
Europa
to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word
Ōuzhōu
(
歐洲
/
欧洲
), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name
Ōuluóbā zhōu
(
歐羅巴洲
) (
zhōu
means "continent"); a similar Chinese-derived term
Ōshū
(
欧州
)
is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union,
Ōshū Rengō
(
欧州連合
)
, despite the
katakana
Yōroppa
(
ヨーロッパ
)
being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name
Frangistan
('land of the
Franks
') is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as
Avrupa
or
Evropa
.

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.
Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the east and north-east are usually taken to be the
Ural Mountains
, the
Ural River
, and the
Caspian Sea
; to the south-east, the
Caucasus Mountains
, the
Black Sea
, and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.
[28]
A medieval
T and O map
printed by
Günther Zainer
in 1472, showing the three continents as domains of the sons of
Noah
- Asia to Sem (
Shem
), Europe to Iafeth (
Japheth
) and Africa to Cham (
Ham
)
Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence
Iceland
is considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to
North America
, although politically belonging to Denmark. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to
Anatolia
(or Asia Minor), but is considered part of Europe politically and it is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of
North-western Africa
for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.
[29]
"Europe", as used specifically in
British English
, may also refer to
Continental Europe
exclusively.
[30]
The term "continent" usually implies the
physical geography
of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in
classical antiquity
, but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges. Cartographer
Herman Moll
suggested in 1715 Europe was bounded by a series of partly-joined waterways directed towards the Turkish straits, and the
Irtysh River
draining into the upper part of the
Ob River
and the
Arctic Ocean
. In contrast, the present eastern boundary of Europe partially adheres to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clear-cut definition of the term "continent".
The current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects
East-West
cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a
transcontinental country
divided entirely by water, while
Russia
and
Kazakhstan
are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other
continents
separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the
Mediterranean Sea
—namely,
Ceuta
and
Melilla
—which are parts of
Africa
and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.
History of the concept
See also:
Boundary between Europe and Asia
Early history
Depiction of
Europa regina
('Queen Europe') in 1582
The first recorded usage of
Eurṓpē
as a geographic term is in the
Homeric Hymn
to
Delian Apollo
, in reference to the western shore of the
Aegean Sea
. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BCE by
Anaximander
and
Hecataeus
. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern
Rioni River
on the territory of
Georgia
) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by
Herodotus
in the 5th century BCE.
[31]
Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts—Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa)—with the
Nile
and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the
River Don
, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.
[32]
Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer
Strabo
at the River Don.
[33]
The
Book of Jubilees
described the continents as the lands given by
Noah
to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the
Pillars of Hercules
at the
Strait of Gibraltar
, separating it from
Northwest Africa
, to the Don, separating it from Asia.
[34]
The convention received by the
Middle Ages
and surviving into modern usage is that of the
Roman era
used by Roman-era authors such as
Posidonius
,
[35]
Strabo
[36]
and
Ptolemy
,
[37]
who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.
The Roman Empire did not attach a strong identity to the concept of continental divisions. However, following the fall of the
Western Roman Empire
, the
culture that developed in its place
, linked to Latin and the Catholic church, began to associate itself with the concept of "Europe".
[38]
The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the
Carolingian Renaissance
of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the
Western Church
, as opposed to both the
Eastern Orthodox
churches and to the
Islamic world
.
A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of
Latin Christendom
coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with
Byzantium
and
Islam
, and limited to northern
Iberia
, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.
[39]
[40]
The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the
Carolingian Renaissance
:
Europa

figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar,
Alcuin
.
[41]
The transition of Europe to being a cultural term as well as a geographic one led to the borders of Europe being affected by cultural considerations in the East, especially relating to areas under Byzantine, Ottoman, and Russian influence. Such questions were affected by the positive connotations associated with the term Europe by its users. Such cultural considerations were not applied to the Americas, despite their conquest and settlement by European states. Instead, the concept of "Western civilization" emerged as a way of grouping together Europe and these colonies.
[42]

Regions of Europe
and
Continental Europe
A New Map of Europe According to the Newest Observations
(1721) by Hermann Moll draws the eastern boundary of Europe along the Don River flowing south-west and the Tobol, Irtysh and Ob rivers flowing north.
1916 political map of Europe showing most of Moll's waterways replaced by von Strahlenberg's Ural Mountains and Freshfield's Caucasus Crest, land features of a type that normally defines a subcontinent
The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of
Muscovy
began to include
North Asia
. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of
Eurasia
into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the
Turkish Straits
, the
Black Sea
, the
Kerch Strait
, the
Sea of Azov
and the
Don
(ancient
Tanais
). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at
Kalach-na-Donu
(where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the
Volga-Don Canal
), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.
Around 1715,
Herman Moll
produced a map showing the northern part of the
Ob River
and the
Irtysh River
, a major tributary of the Ob, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between Europe and Asia.
Four years later, in 1725,
Philip Johan von Strahlenberg
was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary. He drew a new line along the
Volga
, following the Volga north until the
Samara Bend
, along
Obshchy Syrt
(the
drainage divide
between the Volga and
Ural Rivers
), then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the
Ural Mountains
. At this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways. Accordingly, he drew the new boundary north along
Ural Mountains
rather than the nearby and parallel running Ob and Irtysh rivers.
[43]
This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted. However, this did not come without criticism.
Voltaire
, writing in 1760 about
Peter the Great
's efforts to make Russia more European, ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither Russia, Scandinavia, northern Germany, nor Poland were fully part of Europe.
[38]
Since then, many modern analytical geographers like
Halford Mackinder
have declared that they see little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.
[44]
The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The
1745 atlas
published by the
Russian Academy of Sciences
has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as
Serafimovich
before cutting north towards
Arkhangelsk
, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as
John Cary
followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the
Kuma-Manych Depression
was identified
c.
1773
by a German naturalist,
Peter Simon Pallas
, as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,
[45]
[46]
and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.
By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the
Volga-Don Canal
and the Volga, the other following the Kuma-Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the
Greater Caucasus watershed
to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with
Douglas Freshfield
advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".
[47]
In
Russia
and the
Soviet Union
, the boundary along the Kuma-Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.
[48]
In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from
Baydaratskaya Bay
, on the
Kara Sea
, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the
Ural River
until the
Mugodzhar Hills
, and then the
Emba River
; and Kuma-Manych Depression,
[49]
thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.
[50]
However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest,
[51]
and this became the common convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma-Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.
Some view the separation of
Eurasia
into Asia and Europe as a residue of
Eurocentrism
: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity,
China
and
India
are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...]."

During the 2.5 million years of the

, numerous cold phases called
glacials
(
Quaternary ice age
), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter
interglacials
which lasted about 10,000-15,000 years. The last cold episode of the

) and disappeared from the fossil record about 40,000 years ago,
[59]
with their final refuge being the Iberian Peninsula. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (
Cro-Magnons
), who appeared in Europe around 43,000 to 40,000 years ago.
[60]
Homo sapiens arrived in Europe around 54,000 years ago, some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.
[61]
The earliest sites in Europe dated 48,000 years ago are

The
European Neolithic
period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BCE in
Greece
and the
Balkans
, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in
Anatolia
and the
Near East
.
[64]
It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the
Danube
and the
Rhine
(
Linear Pottery culture
), and along the
Mediterranean coast
(
Cardial culture
). Between 4500 and 3000 BCE, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as
causewayed enclosures
,
burial mounds
and
megalithic tombs
.
[65]
The
Corded Ware
cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the
Chalcolithic
. During this period giant
megalithic
monuments, such as the
Megalithic Temples of Malta
and
Stonehenge
, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.
[66]

The modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages:

Epigravettian
culture;

[69]

of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of
Indo-European migrations
5,000 years ago.

The
European Bronze Age

The Minoans were followed by the

, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BCE, ushering the
European Iron Age
.
[72]
Iron Age colonisation by the
Greeks
and
Phoenicians
gave rise to early

Ancient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western
democratic
and
rationalist culture
are often attributed to Ancient Greece.
[74]
The Greek city-state, the
polis
, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.
[74]
In 508 BCE,
Cleisthenes
instituted the world's first
democratic
system of government in
Athens
.
[75]
The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in
philosophy
,
humanism
and
rationalism
under
Aristotle
,
Socrates
and
Plato
; in
history
with
Herodotus
and
Thucydides
; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of

By 200 BCE, Rome had conquered
Italy
and over the following two centuries it conquered
Greece
and
Hispania
(
Spain
and
Portugal
), the
North African
coast, much of the
Middle East
,
Gaul
(
France
and
Belgium
) and
Britannia
(
England
and
Wales
).
Expanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the third century BCE, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean Basin and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The
Roman Republic
ended in 27 BCE, when
Augustus
proclaimed the
Roman Empire
. The two centuries that followed are known as the
pax romana
, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and political stability in most of Europe.
[81]
The empire continued to expand under emperors such as
Antoninus Pius
and
Marcus Aurelius
, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting
Germanic
,
Pictish
and
Scottish
tribes.
[82]
[83]
Christianity
was
legalised
by
Constantine I
in 313 CE after three centuries of
imperial persecution
. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of
Byzantium
(modern-day
Istanbul
) which was renamed
Constantinople
in his honour in 330 CE. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE and in 391-392 CE, the emperor
Theodosius
outlawed pagan religions.
[84]
This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
in 476 CE; the closure of the pagan
Platonic Academy of Athens
in 529 CE;
[85]
or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century CE. During most of its existence, the
Byzantine Empire
was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.

During the
decline of the Roman Empire
, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "
Age of Migrations
". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the
Ostrogoths
,
Visigoths
,
Goths
,
Vandals
,
Huns
,
Franks
,
Angles
,
Saxons
,
Slavs
,
Avars
,
Bulgars
and, later on, the
Vikings
,
Pechenegs
,
Cumans
and
Magyars
.
[81]
Renaissance
thinkers such as
Petrarch
would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".
[87]
Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe, though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.
[88]
While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking
Eastern Roman Empire
, also known as the
Byzantine Empire
. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe. Emperor
Justinian I
presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a
legal code
that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the
Hagia Sophia
and brought the Christian church under state control.
[89]
From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring
Sasanid Persians
were severely weakened due to the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent
Byzantine-Sasanian wars
, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into
Asia Minor
. In the mid-7th century, following the
Muslim conquest of Persia
, Islam penetrated into the
Caucasus
region.
[90]
Over the next centuries Muslim forces took
Cyprus
,
Malta
,
Crete
,
Sicily
and
parts of southern Italy
.
[91]
Between 711 and 720, most of the lands of the
Visigothic Kingdom
of
Iberia
was brought under
Muslim
rule—save for small areas in the north-west (
Asturias
) and largely
Basque
regions in the
Pyrenees
. This territory, under the Arabic name
Al-Andalus
, became part of the expanding
Umayyad Caliphate
. The unsuccessful
second siege of Constantinople
(717) weakened the
Umayyad dynasty
and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the
Frankish
leader
Charles Martel
at the
Battle of Poitiers
in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle
Pyrenees
the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of
Asturias
,
Leon
and
Galicia
were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the
Moors
out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focused on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the
Reconquista
took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordoños, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.
Viking
raids and division of the Frankish Empire at the
Treaty of Verdun
in 843
During the Dark Ages, the
Western Roman Empire
fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.
[92]
Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under
Clovis I
.
[93]
Charlemagne
, a Frankish king of the
Carolingian
dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "
Holy Roman Emperor
" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the
Holy Roman Empire
, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.
[94]
East Central Europe
saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of
Christianity
(
c.
1000 CE)
. The powerful
West Slavic
state of
Great Moravia
spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under
Svatopluk I
and causing a series of armed conflicts with
East Francia
. Further south, the first
South Slavic states
emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted
Christianity
: the
First Bulgarian Empire
, the
Serbian Principality
(later
Kingdom
and
Empire
) and the
Duchy of Croatia
(later
Kingdom of Croatia
). To the East,
Kievan Rus'
expanded from its capital in
Kiev
to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988,
Vladimir the Great
adopted
Orthodox Christianity
as the religion of state.
[95]
[96]
Further East,
Volga Bulgaria
became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.

The
maritime republics
of medieval
Italy
reestablished contacts between Europe, Asia and Africa with extensive trade networks and colonies across the Mediterranean, and had an essential role in the
Crusades
.
[98]
[99]
The period between the year 1000 and 1250 is known as the
High Middle Ages
, followed by the
Late Middle Ages
until c. 1500.
During the High Middle Ages the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the
Renaissance of the 12th century
. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the
Mediterranean
and
Baltic Seas
. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the
Maritime Republics
a leading role in the European scene.
The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy.
Feudalism
developed in
France
in the Early Middle Ages, and soon spread throughout Europe.
[100]
A struggle for influence between the
nobility
and the
monarchy
in England led to the writing of the
Magna Carta
and the establishment of a
parliament
.
[101]
The primary source of culture in this period came from the
Roman Catholic Church
. Through monasteries and
cathedral schools
, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.
[100]
Tancred of Sicily
and
Philip II of France
, during the
Third Crusade
(1189-1192)
The
Papacy
reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An
East-West Schism
in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the
Eastern Orthodox Church
in the
Byzantine Empire
and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095
Pope Urban II
called for a
crusade
against
Muslims
occupying
Jerusalem
and the
Holy Land
.
[102]
In Europe itself, the Church organised the
Inquisition
against heretics. In the
Iberian Peninsula
, the
Reconquista
concluded with the
fall of Granada in 1492
, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.
[103]
In the east, a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims, and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.
[104]
The Empire was weakened following the defeat at
Manzikert
, and was weakened considerably by the
sack of Constantinople in 1204
, during the
Fourth Crusade
.

fell in 1453

Constantinople was taken
by the
Ottoman Empire
.

The sacking of
Suzdal
by
Batu Khan
in 1238, during the
Mongol invasion of Europe
(1220s-1240s)
In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic
Turkic
tribes, such as the
Pechenegs
and the
Cuman-Kipchaks
, caused a massive migration of
Slavic
populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.
[117]
Like many other parts of
Eurasia
, these territories were
overrun by the Mongols
.
[118]
The invaders, who became known as
Tatars
, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the
Golden Horde
with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion, and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.
[119]
[120]
After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century:
Moldavia
and
Walachia
. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.
[121]
From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the
Grand Duchy of Moscow
grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480, and eventually becoming the
Tsardom of Russia
. The state was consolidated under
Ivan III the Great
and
Ivan the Terrible
, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.
The
Great Famine of 1315-1317
was the first
crisis
that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.
[122]
The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of
France
was reduced by half.
[123]
[124]
Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,
[125]
and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.
[126]
Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the
Black Death
, one of the most deadly
pandemics
in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the
European population
at the time.
[127]
The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by
Giovanni Boccaccio
in
The Decameron
(1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased
persecution of Jews
,
beggars
and
lepers
.
[128]
The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying
virulence
and mortalities until the 18th century.
[129]
During this period, more than 100 plague
epidemics
swept across Europe.

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in
Florence
, and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a
new humanism
was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten
classical Greek
and Arabic knowledge from
monastic
libraries, often translated from Arabic into
Latin
.
[131]
[132]
[133]
The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of
art
,
philosophy
,
music
, and the
sciences
, under the joint patronage of
royalty
, the nobility, the
Roman Catholic Church
and an emerging merchant class.
[134]

family of Florentine bankers and the

,

and
Leonardo da Vinci
.
[137]
[138]
Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the
Western Schism
. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in
Avignon
and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.
[139]
In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.
[140]
[141]
Exploration reached the
Southern Hemisphere
in the Atlantic and the Southern tip of Africa.
Christopher Columbus
reached the
New World
in 1492, and
Vasco da Gama
opened the ocean route to the
East
linking the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans
in 1498. The Portuguese-born explorer
Ferdinand Magellan
reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the
Pacific Oceans
in a Spanish expedition, resulting in the first
circumnavigation of the globe
, completed by the Spaniard
Juan Sebastián Elcano
(1519-1522). Soon after, the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the
Americas
, Asia, Africa and Oceania.
[142]
France, the
Netherlands
and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas and Asia. In 1588, a
Spanish armada
failed to invade England. A year later
England tried unsuccessfully to invade Spain
, allowing
Philip II of Spain
to maintain his dominant war capacity in Europe. This English disaster also allowed the Spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades. However, two more Spanish armadas failed to invade England (

and
3rd Spanish Armada
).

[147]
The Church's power was further weakened by the
Protestant Reformation
in 1517 when German theologian
Martin Luther
nailed his
Ninety-five Theses
criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull
Exsurge Domine
in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521
Diet of Worms
, which divided German princes between
Protestant
and Roman Catholic faiths.
[148]
Religious fighting and warfare
spread with Protestantism.
[149]
The plunder of the empires of the Americas allowed Spain to finance
religious persecution
in Europe for over a century.
[150]
The
Thirty Years War
(1618-1648) crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of
Germany
, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.
[151]
In the aftermath of the
Peace of Westphalia
, France rose to predominance within Europe.
[152]
The defeat of the
Ottoman Turks
at the
Battle of Vienna
in 1683 marked the historic end of
Ottoman expansion into Europe
.
[153]
The 17th century in Central and parts of Eastern Europe was a period of general
decline
;
[154]
the region experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.
[155]
From the
Union of Krewo
(1385) east-central Europe was dominated by the
Kingdom of Poland
and the
Grand Duchy of Lithuania
. The
hegemony
of the vast
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
had ended with the devastation brought by the
Second Northern War
(
Deluge
) and subsequent conflicts;
[156]
the state itself was
partitioned
and ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century.
[157]
From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the
Golden Horde
were conquered by Russia,
Tatars
from the
Crimean Khanate
frequently
raided
Eastern Slavic lands to
capture slaves
.
[158]
Further east, the
Nogai Horde
and
Kazakh Khanate
frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of contemporary Russia and Ukraine for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).
The Renaissance and the
New Monarchs
marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention and scientific development.
[159]
Among the great figures of the Western
scientific revolution
of the 16th and 17th centuries were
Copernicus
,
Kepler
,
Galileo
and
Isaac Newton
.
[160]
According to Peter Barrett, "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world."

. Consequently, when the
American Revolutionary War
turned into a global war between 1778 and 1783, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.
[161]
The Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.
[162]
[163]
[164]
Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution, and the establishment of the
First Republic
as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial
reign of terror
.
[165]
Napoleon Bonaparte
rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and established the
First French Empire
that, during the
Napoleonic Wars
, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the
Battle of Waterloo
.
[166]
[167]
Napoleonic rule
resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the
nation state
, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of
administration
,
law
and
education
.
[168]
[169]
[170]
The
Congress of Vienna
, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new
balance of power
in Europe centred on the five "
Great Powers
": the UK, France,
Prussia
,
Austria
and Russia.
[171]
This balance would remain in place until the
Revolutions of 1848
, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.
[172]
The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the
Austro-Hungarian empire
was
formed
; 1871 saw the unifications of both
Italy
and
Germany
as nation-states from smaller principalities.
[173]
In parallel, the
Eastern Question
grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the
Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774)
. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the
Great Powers
struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The
Russian Empire
stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the
Habsburg Empire
and
Britain
perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the
Serbian revolution
(1804) and
Greek War of Independence
(1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the
Balkans
, which ended with the
Balkan Wars
in 1912-1913.

Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the
first laws
on
child labour
, the legalisation of
trade unions
,
[176]
and the
abolition of slavery
.
[177]
In Britain, the
Public Health Act of 1875
was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.
[178]
Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.
[179]
The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the
Great Famine of Ireland
, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.
[180]
In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.
[181]
The industrial revolution also led to large population growth, and the
share of the world population living in Europe
reached a peak of slightly above 25% around the year 1913.

Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. The First World War was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when
Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
was assassinated by the
Yugoslav nationalist
[184]
Gavrilo Princip
.
[185]
Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the
Entente Powers
(
France
,
Belgium
,
Serbia
, Portugal,
Russia
, the United Kingdom, and later
Italy
,
Greece
,
Romania
, and the United States) and the
Central Powers
(
Austria-Hungary
,
Germany
,
Bulgaria
, and the
Ottoman Empire
). The war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead.
[186]
Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.
[187]
Map depicting the military alliances of the
First World War

Russia was plunged into the
Russian Revolution
, which threw down the
Tsarist monarchy
and replaced it with the
communist
Soviet Union
,
[188]
leading also to the independence of many former
Russian governorates
, such as
Finland
,
Estonia
,
Latvia
and
Lithuania
, as new European countries.
[189]
Austria-Hungary
and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The
Treaty of Versailles
, which officially ended the First World War in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.
[190]
Excess deaths in Russia over the course of the First World War and the
Russian Civil War
(including the postwar
famine
) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.
[191]
In 1932-1933, under
Stalin
's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the
second Soviet famine
which caused millions of deaths;
[192]
surviving
kulaks
were persecuted and many sent to
Gulags
to do
forced labour
. Stalin was also responsible for the
Great Purge
of 1937-38 in which the
NKVD
executed 681,692 people;
[193]
millions of people were
deported and exiled
to remote areas of the Soviet Union.
[194]

(1914-1918) cost the country one quarter of its population.

Nazi Germany
began the devastating Second World War in Europe by its leader,
Adolf Hitler
. Here Hitler, on the right, with his closest ally, the Italian dictator
Benito Mussolini
, in 1940.
The
social revolutions
sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following
The Great War
: in 1919, with the
Weimar Republic
in Germany and the
First Austrian Republic
; in 1922, with
Mussolini
's one-party
fascist
government in the
Kingdom of Italy
and in
Atatürk
's
Turkish Republic
, adopting the Western alphabet and state
secularism
.
Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This, and the
Wall Street Crash of 1929
, brought about the worldwide
Great Depression
. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism,
fascist movements
developed throughout Europe placing
Adolf Hitler
in power of what became
Nazi Germany
.
[200]
[201]
In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the
Saarland
and
Rhineland
in 1935 and 1936. In 1938,
Austria
became a part of Germany following the
Anschluss
. Later that year, following the
Munich Agreement
signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, Germany annexed the
Sudetenland
, which was a part of
Czechoslovakia
inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
, controlled by Germany and the
Slovak Republic
. At the time, the United Kingdom and France preferred a policy of
appeasement
.
With tensions mounting between Germany and
Poland
over the future of
Danzig
, the Germans turned to the Soviets and signed the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany
invaded Poland
on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the
European Theatre of the Second World War
.
[202]
[203]
[204]
The
Soviet invasion of Poland
started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the
Baltic countries
and, on 30 November, Finland, the latter of which was followed by the devastating
Winter War
for the Red Army.
[205]
The British hoped to land at
Narvik
and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The
Phoney War
continued.
In May 1940, Germany
attacked France
through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August, Germany had begun a
bombing offensive against the United Kingdom
but failed to convince the Britons to give up.
[206]
In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in
Operation Barbarossa
.
[207]
On 7 December 1941
Japan
's
attack on Pearl Harbor
drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the
British Empire
, and other
allied
forces.

,

and
Joseph Stalin
After the staggering
Battle of Stalingrad
in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The
Battle of Kursk
, which involved the largest
tank battle
in history, was the last major German offensive on the
Eastern Front
. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the
D-Day landings
, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally
fell in 1945
, ending the Second World War in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with
60 million dead across the world
.
[210]
More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of the Second World War,
[211]
including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during
the Holocaust
.
[212]
The Soviet Union
lost around 27 million people
(mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all Second World War casualties.
[213]
By the end of the Second World War, Europe had more than 40 million
refugees
.
[214]
[215]
[216]
Several
post-war expulsions
in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people.
[217]
The First World War, and especially the Second World War, diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After the Second World War the map of Europe was redrawn at the
Yalta Conference
and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by
Winston Churchill
an "
Iron Curtain
". The United States and Western Europe established the
NATO
alliance and, later, the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the
Warsaw Pact
.
[218]
Particular hot spots after the Second World War were
Berlin
and
Trieste
, whereby the
Free Territory of Trieste
, founded in 1947 with the UN, was dissolved in 1954 and 1975, respectively. The
Berlin blockade
in 1948 and 1949 and the construction of the
Berlin Wall
in 1961 were one of the great international crises of the
Cold War
.
[219]
[220]
[221]
The two new
superpowers
, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on
nuclear proliferation
. At the same time
decolonisation
, which had already started after the First World War, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.
[17]
Flag of Europe
, adopted by the
Council of Europe
in 1955 as the flag for the whole of Europe
[222]
In the 1980s the
reforms
of
Mikhail Gorbachev
and the
Solidarity
movement in Poland weakened the previously rigid communist system. The opening of the
Iron Curtain
at the
Pan-European Picnic
then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the
Eastern bloc
, the
Warsaw Pact
and other
communist states collapsed
, and the Cold War ended.
[223]
[224]
[225]
Germany was reunited, after the symbolic
fall of the Berlin Wall
in 1989 and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.
[226]
This made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible, and previously isolated cities such as
Berlin
,
Prague
,
Vienna
,
Budapest
and
Trieste
were now again in the centre of Europe.
[200]
[227]
[228]
[229]
European integration
also grew after the Second World War. In 1949 the
Council of Europe
was founded, following a speech by Sir
Winston Churchill
, with the idea of unifying Europe
[18]
to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for
Belarus
,
Russia
,
[230]
and
Vatican City
. The
Treaty of Rome
in 1957 established the
European Economic Community
between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.
[231]
In 1967 the EEC,
European Coal and Steel Community
, and
Euratom
formed the
European Community
, which in 1993 became the
European Union
. The EU established a
parliament
,
court
and
central bank
, and introduced the
euro
as a unified currency.
[232]
Between 2004 and 2013, more Central European countries began joining,
expanding the EU
to 28 European countries and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.
[233]
However, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, as a result of a
June 2016 referendum on EU membership
.
[234]
The
Russo-Ukrainian conflict
, which has been ongoing since 2014, steeply escalated when Russia launched a
full-scale invasion
of
Ukraine
on 24 February 2022, marking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War
[235]
and the
Yugoslav Wars
.
[236]
Geography
Main article:
Geography of Europe
Map of populous Europe and surrounding regions showing physical, political and population characteristics, as per 2018
Europe makes up the western fifth of the
Eurasian
landmass.
[28]
It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.
[237]
Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas to the south.
[238]
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high
Alps
,
Pyrenees
and
Carpathians
, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the
Great European Plain
and at its heart lies the
North German Plain
. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous,
fjord
-cut spine of Norway.
This description is simplified. Subregions such as the
Iberian Peninsula
and the
Italian Peninsula
contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like
Iceland
, Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean that is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until
rising sea levels
cut them off.
Climate
Main article:
Climate of Europe
Biomes
of Europe and surrounding regions:
tundra
alpine tundra
taiga

temperate broadleaf forest
mediterranean forest

Europe lies mainly in the
temperate
climate zone of the northern hemisphere, where the
prevailing wind direction is from the west
. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the
Gulf Stream
, an ocean current which carries warm water from the
Gulf of Mexico
across the
Atlantic ocean
to Europe.
[239]
The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.
Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of
Aveiro
is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 13 °C (55 °F) in
New York City
which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.
[239]
The large water masses of the
Mediterranean Sea
, which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the
Sahara desert
to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the
Adriatic Sea
near
Trieste
.
[240]
In general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th
latitudes
. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea. (location, approximate latitude and longitude, coldest month average, hottest month average and annual average temperatures in degrees C)

Geology
Main articles:
Geology of Europe
and
Geological history of Europe
Surficial geology of Europe
The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the
Baltic Shield
(Fennoscandia) and the
Sarmatian craton
, both around 2.25 billion years ago, followed by the
Volgo-Uralia
shield, the three together leading to the
East European craton
(≈
Baltica
) which became a part of the
supercontinent
Columbia
. Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the
Laurentia
block) became joined to
Rodinia
, later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago
Euramerica
was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with
Gondwana
then leading to the formation of
Pangea
. Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and
Laurasia
split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via
Greenland
, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the
late Tertiary
period about five million years ago.
[243]
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the
Scottish Highlands
to the rolling
plains
of Hungary.
[244]
Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous
Southern Europe
and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the
Ural Mountains
in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the
Pyrenees
and
Alps
/
Carpathians
. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the
Scandinavian Mountains
and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the
Celtic Sea
, the
North Sea
, the
Baltic Sea
complex and
Barents Sea
.
The northern plain contains the old geological continent of
Baltica
and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient
microcontinent
Avalonia
.
Flora
Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green) and tundra, or bogs, in the north (dark yellow)
Having lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of humans. With the exception of
Fennoscandia
and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various
national parks
.
The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed
forest
. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the
Gulf Stream
and
North Atlantic Drift
warm the continent. Southern Europe has a warm but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these, such as the
Alps
and the
Pyrenees
, are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north (
Scandinavian Mountains
,
Dinarides
,
Carpathians
,
Apennines
) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by
livestock
at some point in time, and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.
Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch
Possibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.
[245]
It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of
deforestation
, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the
broadleaf and mixed
forests,
taiga
of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed
rainforests
of the Caucasus and the
Cork oak
forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture
plantations
of
conifers
have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2-3% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5-10%. The European country with the
smallest percentage of forested area
is
Iceland
(1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).
[246]
In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both
broadleaf
and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are
beech
and
oak
. In the north, the taiga is a mixed
spruce
-
pine
-
birch
forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to
tundra
as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many
olive
trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate;
Mediterranean Cypress
is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian
grassland
(the
steppe
) extends westwards from
Ukraine
and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.
Fauna
Main article:
Fauna of Europe
Biogeographic regions
of Europe and bordering regions
Glaciation during the
most recent ice age
and the presence of humans affected the distribution of
European fauna
. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top
predator
species have been hunted to extinction. The
woolly mammoth
was extinct before the end of the
Neolithic
period. Today
wolves
(
carnivores
) and
bears
(
omnivores
) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the
Middle Ages
the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the
brown bear
lives primarily in the
Balkan peninsula
, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition,
polar bears
may be found on
Svalbard
, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The
wolf
, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in
Central and Eastern Europe
and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of
Western Europe
(Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).
Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia,
European bison
now live in nature preserves in
Białowieża Forest
, on the border between
Poland
and
Belarus
.
[247]
[248]
Other carnivores include the
European wildcat
,
red fox
and
arctic fox
, the
golden jackal
, different species of
martens
, the
European hedgehog
, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, as well as different birds (
owls
,
hawks
and other birds of prey).
Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the
small tortoiseshell
butterfly, add to the biodiversity.
[249]
Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly
phytoplankton
. Important animals that live in European seas are
zooplankton
,
molluscs
,
echinoderms
, different
crustaceans
,
squids
and
octopuses
, fish,
dolphins
and
whales
.
Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's
Bern Convention
, which has also been signed by the
European Community
as well as non-European states.

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the
Napoleonic Wars
in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is
parliamentary democracy
, in most cases in the form of
Republic
; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the
Monarchy
. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies
[250]
are
constitutional
.
European integration
is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the
Council of Europe
since the end of the
Second World War
. The
European Union
has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the
Eurasian Economic Union
has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.
27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free
Schengen Area
and 20 of the monetary union
Eurozone
. Among the smaller European organisations are the
Nordic Council
, the
Benelux
, the
Baltic Assembly
and the
Visegrád Group

Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or close to Europe. This includes
Åland
(an
autonomous county
of Finland), two
autonomous territories of the Kingdom of Denmark
(other than Denmark proper), three
Crown Dependencies
and two
British Overseas Territories
.
Svalbard
is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three
countries of the United Kingdom
with devolved powers and the two
Autonomous Regions of Portugal
, which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as the
Canary Islands
and
Heligoland
, are also not included for this reason.

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008.
[251]
In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.
[252]
As with other continents, Europe has a large
wealth gap
among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the
Northwest
and
West
in general, followed by
Central Europe
, while most economies of
Eastern
and
Southeastern Europe
are still reemerging from the
collapse of the Soviet Union
and the
breakup of Yugoslavia
.
The model of the
Blue Banana
was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions, which was further developed into the
Golden Banana
or Blue Star. The trade between East and West, as well as towards Asia, which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars, new borders and the Cold War, increased sharply after 1989. In addition, there is new impetus from the Chinese
Belt and Road Initiative
across the
Suez Canal
towards Africa and Asia.
[253]
The European Union, a political entity composed of 27 European states, comprises the
largest single economic area
in the world. Nineteen EU
countries
share the
euro
as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest
national economies in GDP (PPP)
. This includes (ranks according to the
CIA
): Germany (6), Russia (7), the United Kingdom (10), France (11) and Italy (13).
[254]
Some European countries are much richer than others. The richest in terms of nominal GDP is
Monaco
with its US$185,829 per capita (2018) and the poorest is
Ukraine
with its US$3,659 per capita (2019).
[255]
As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.

Economic history
Industrial growth (1760-1945)
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.
[262]
From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.
[263]
The
Industrial Revolution
started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,
[264]
and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by the First World War, but by the beginning of the Second World War, they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. The Second World War, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.
Cold War (1945-1991)
Fall of the
Berlin Wall
in 1989
Eurozone
(blue colour)
After the Second World War the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,
[265]
and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.
[266]
Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany
recovered quickly
and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.
[267]
France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of
Franco
, also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the
Spanish miracle
.
[268]
The majority of
Central and Eastern European
states came under the control of the
Soviet Union
and thus were members of the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance
(COMECON).
[269]
The states which retained a
free-market
system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the
Marshall Plan
.
[270]
The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the
Cold War
. Until 1990, the
European Community
was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.
Reunification (1991-present)
One of
Kosovo
's main economical sources is
mining
, because it has large reserves of lead,
zinc
, silver,
nickel
,
cobalt
, copper, iron and
bauxite
.
[271]
Miners at the
Trepča Mines
in
Mitrovica
, Kosovo in 2011.
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states underwent
shock therapy
measures to liberalise their economies and implement free market reforms.
After
East
and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany, while the latter
experienced sudden mass unemployment and plummeting of industrial production
.
By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe, comprising the five largest European economies of the time: Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the
Eurozone
, replacing their national currencies by the
euro
.
Figures released by
Eurostat
in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into
recession
in 2008.
[272]
It impacted much of the region.
[273]
In 2010, fears of a
sovereign debt crisis
[274]
developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.
[275]
As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.
[276]
The
EU-27
unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012.
[277]
For those aged 15-24 it was 22.4%.
[277]

Ageing of Europe
Population growth
in and around Europe in 2021
[278]
The population of Europe was about 742 million in 2023 according to UN estimates.
[2]
[3]
This is slightly more than one ninth of the world's population.
[c]
The
population density
of Europe (the number of people per area) is the second highest of any continent, behind Asia. The population of Europe is currently slowly decreasing, by about 0.2% per year,
[279]
because
there are fewer births than deaths
. This natural decrease in population is reduced by the fact that more people
migrate to Europe
from other continents than vice versa.
Southern Europe and Western Europe are the regions with the highest average number of elderly people in the world, today they comprise 21% of the population, with over 65 years.
[280]
Projections suggest that by 2050 Europe will reach 30%.
[281]
This is caused by the fact that the population has been
having children below replacement level
since the 1970s. The
United Nations
predicts that Europe will decline its population between 2022 and 2050 by −7 per cent, without changing immigration movements.
[282]
According to a population projection of the UN Population Division, Europe's population may fall to between 680 and 720 million people by 2050, which would be 7% of the world population at that time.
[283]
Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to
fertility rates
. The average number of
children per female
of child-bearing age is 1.52, far below the replacement rate.
[284]
The UN predicts a steady
population decline
in
Central and Eastern Europe
as a result of emigration and low birth rates.
[285]
Ethnic groups
Main article:
Ethnic groups in Europe
Further information:
Genetic history of Europe
Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute
ethnic minorities
.
[286]
Migration
Main articles:
Immigration to Europe
and
European diaspora
Map showing areas of European settlement (people who claim full European descent)
Europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at nearly 87 million people in 2020, according to the
International Organisation for Migration
.
[287]
In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from
immigration
of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total
population growth
.
[288]
In 2021, 827,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU member state, an increase of about 14% compared with 2020.
[289]
2.3 million immigrants from non-EU countries entered the EU in 2021.
[289]
Early modern
emigration from Europe
began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century,
[290]
[291]
and French and English settlers in the 17th century.
[292]
But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.
[293]
Today,
large populations of European descent
are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in
Uruguay
,
Argentina
,
Chile
and
Brazil
, while most of the other
Latin American
countries also have a considerable
population of European origins
).
Australia
and
New Zealand
have large European-derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of
Cape Verde
and probably
São Tomé and Príncipe
, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the
White South Africans
in
South Africa
. In Asia, European-derived populations, (specifically
Russians
), predominate in
North Asia
and some parts of Northern
Kazakhstan
.
[294]
Languages
Main article:
Languages of Europe
Distribution of major
languages of Europe
See also:
List of European languages by number of speakers
Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,
[295]
mostly falling within three
Indo-European
language groups: the
Romance languages
, derived from the
Latin
of the
Roman Empire
; the
Germanic languages
, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the
Slavic languages
.
[243]
Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe, as well as in
Switzerland
in Central Europe and
Romania
and
Moldova
in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in
Gibraltar
and
Malta
in Southern Europe.
[243]
Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in
English
, for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the
Baltic
group (
Latvian
and
Lithuanian
), the
Celtic
group (
Irish
,
Scottish Gaelic
,
Manx
,
Welsh
,
Cornish
and
Breton
[243]
),
Greek
,
Armenian
and
Albanian
.
A distinct non-Indo-European family of
Uralic languages
(
Estonian
,
Finnish
,
Hungarian
,
Erzya
,
Komi
,
Mari
,
Moksha
and
Udmurt
) is spoken mainly in
Estonia
,
Finland
,
Hungary
and parts of Russia.
Turkic languages
include
Azerbaijani
,
Kazakh
and
Turkish
, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe (
Balkan Gagauz Turkish
,
Bashkir
,
Chuvash
,
Crimean Tatar
,
Karachay-Balkar
,
Kumyk
,
Nogai
and
Tatar
).
Kartvelian languages
(
Georgian
,
Mingrelian
and
Svan
) are spoken primarily in
Georgia
. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed
Northeast Caucasian
, most notably including
Chechen
,
Avar
and
Lezgin
; and
Northwest Caucasian
, most notably including
Adyghe
).
Maltese
is the only
Semitic language
that is official within the EU, while
Basque
is the only European
language isolate
.
Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The
Council of Europe
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities
and the Council of Europe's
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

The largest religion in Europe is
Christianity
, with 63.2% of Europeans considering themselves
Christians
,
[296]
[297]
including
Catholic
,
Eastern Orthodox
and various
Protestant
denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are
Lutheranism
,
Anglicanism
and the
Reformed faith
. Smaller Protestant denominations include
Anabaptists
as well as denominations centered in the
United States
such as
Pentecostalism
,
Methodism
, and
Evangelicalism
. Although Christianity originated in the Middle East, its centre of mass shifted to Europe when it
became the official religion of the Roman Empire
in the late 4th century.
Christianity
played
a prominent role in the development
of the
European culture
and
identity
.
[298]
[299]
[300]
Today, a bit over 25% of the world's Christians live in Europe.
[301]
Islam
is the second most popular religion in Europe. Over 25 million, or roughly 17% of the population, adhere to it.
[302]
In
Albania
and
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, two countries in the
Balkan peninsula
in Southeastern Europe, Islam instead of Christianity is the majority religion. This is of also the case in
Turkey
and in
certain parts of Russia
, as well as in
Azerbaijan
and
Kazakhstan
, all of which are at the border to Asia.
[302]
Many countries in Europe are home to a sizeable Muslim minority, and
immigration to Europe
has increased the number of Muslim people in Europe in recent years.
The
Jewish
population in Europe was about 1.4 million people in 2020 (about 0.2% of the population).
[303]
There is a long
history of Jewish life in Europe
, beginning in antiquity. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had the majority of the world's Jews living within its borders.
[304]
In 1897, according to
Russian census of 1897
, the total Jewish population of Russia was 5.1 million people, which was 4.13% of total population. Of this total, the vast majority lived within the
Pale of Settlement
.
[305]
In 1933, there were about 9.5 million Jewish people in Europe, representing 1.7% of the population,
[306]
but most were killed or displaced across Europe during
The Holocaust
.
[307]
[303]
In the 21st century,
France
has the largest
Jewish population
in Europe, followed by the
United Kingdom
,
Germany
and
Russia
.
[8]
Other religions practiced in Europe include
Hinduism
and
Buddhism
, are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's
Republic of Kalmykia
).
A large and increasing number people in Europe are
irreligious
,
atheist
and
agnostic
. They are estimated to make up about 18.3% of Europe's population currently.
[8]
Major cities and urban areas
Further information:
List of European cities by population within city limits
The three largest
urban areas of Europe
are
Moscow
,
London
and
Paris
. All have over 10 million residents,
[308]
and as such have been described as
megacities
.
[309]
While
Istanbul
has the highest total city population, it lies partly in
Asia
. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side.
The next largest cities in order of population are
Madrid
,
Saint Petersburg
,
Milan
,
Barcelona
,
Berlin
, and
Rome
each having over three million residents.
[308]
When considering the commuter belts or

Map purportedly displaying the European continent split along cultural and state borders as proposed by the German organisation
Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen
[]
(StAGN)
"Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of
ancient Greece
and the
Roman Empire
and its cultures. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of
Christendom
(or more specifically
Latin Christendom
), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially
against Islam
, as in the
Reconquista
and the
Ottoman wars in Europe
.
[311]
This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into
Slavic
,
Latin (Romance)
and
Germanic
, but with several components not part of either of these group (notably
Greek
,
Basque
and
Celtic
). Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are
Strasbourg
with Latin (Romance) and Germanic or
Trieste
with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots.
Cultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe. Europe is often described as "maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances".
Different cultural events are organised in Europe, with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance, such as the
European Capital of Culture
, the
European Region of Gastronomy
, the
European Youth Capital
and the European Capital of Sport.
Sport
This section is an excerpt from
Sport in Europe
.
[
]
Football
is one of the most popular sports in Europe.
Camp Nou
stadium in
Barcelona
, the largest in Europe.
Sport in Europe
tends to be highly organised with many sports having professional leagues.
The origins of many of the world's most popular sports today lie in the codification of many traditional games, especially in the United Kingdom. However, a paradoxical feature of European sport is the extent to which local, regional and national variations continue to exist, and even in some instances to predominate.

"Blue & Grey"
A 25-second sample of the
pre-chorus
and
chorus
of "Blue & Grey", a soft
pop ballad
,
[14]
[15]
driven by sparse instrumental production and breathy vocals.
[16]
[17]
The lyrics address themes that include depression and anxiety.
[16]
Problems playing this file? See

.
Musically, "Blue & Grey" is a slow, melancholic, soft
pop ballad
,
[14]
[15]
[18]
with a length of four minutes and 14 seconds.
[19]
It is written in the
key
of
G# major
with a
tempo
of 122 beats per minute.
[19]
The song is set in a "cinematic" arrangement of minor
chords
[15]
and relies on a "sparse-yet-tender" production
[16]
that includes acoustic guitar,
[20]
twinkling pianos, and wistful strings.
[21]
The song contains "
spoken-word
" and "rapping segments" interspersed with "breathy", "crooning", "eerie whale-call" vocals, and "chilly" chords.
[15]
[17]
[22]
The song uses the colors blue and grey to illustrate depression and anxiety.
[16]
[17]
[18]
Lyrically, the song explores the themes of fear, depression, burn-out, and pandemic-induced loneliness.
[23]
[24]
In the opening verse of the track, V confesses dejectedly, as indicated in the lines: "Someone come and save me, please/ only the sighs of an exhausting day." It is followed by an audible exhalation from
Jungkook
who leads the breathy verse, reflecting on the blues.
[17]
[23]
A similar "weighty exhalation" from Suga takes place before his rap verse, which he delivers in a "laidback" rhyming pattern.
[17]
Jimin
lends a "plaintive" and "cheery"
tenor
to the song.
[23]
Kat Moon from
Time
magazine noted that an "h" sound is repeated in both
Korean
and English throughout the track, which she associated with the "motif of sighing deeply from exhaustion."
[17]
Meanwhile, Aja Romano of
Vox
rendered the breathy vocal touches as "comfort pop" sounds, noting them being used to create "intimacy between artist and listener" in the song.
[23]
In the lyrics, BTS also plead for happiness and aching loneliness: "I just want to be happier, is this too much greed?",
[25]
and remind the listener to be hopeful: "If, in a far-flung future, I'm able to smile / I'll tell you that I did."
[18]
[26]
Critical reception
[
edit
]
"Blue & Grey" was met with generally positive reviews from
music critics
.
[27]
In the
Los Angeles Times
, August Brown named it as "one of the exemplary songs of the 'pandemic-pop' era" that acts as "a ribbon of immaculate bedroom
emo
, gorgeously harmonized but never show-offy or overpowering."
[28]
Jochan Embley of the
Evening Standard
called the song "the schmaltziest moment on the album, ticking all the boxes for all the feels."
[21]
Reviewing for
NME
, Rhian Daly raved about BTS' vocal delivery and chose "Blue & Grey" as the "most devastating song on the album [..] in terms that are crushingly vulnerable," writing that the song's "redemptive arc is longer, lower and harder to spot."
[26]
Lenika Cruz of
The Atlantic
labelled the track a "midnight-colored lullaby" and wrote that it "speak[s] to BTS's stylistic omnivorousness."
[5]
Stereogum
reviewer Chris DeVille called the song "the only true slow jam" on
Be
, praising the "compositional and production details," and opined that it is akin to "
Linkin Park
and
Sigur Rós
teaming up to write a
Boyz II Men
song."
[15]
Romano lauded the "confessional quality" of the song and hailed BTS' "gorgeous" and emotional vocal delivery, which he found similar to "the melodic equivalent of an
ASMR
session."
[23]
Moon deemed the song as "the most emotionally raw number on the album."
[17]
Raisa Bruner from
Time
called it "the most poetic-and introspective-track off of
Be
," complimenting the balance created by band members Suga and J-Hope who "modulate their rapping to fit the slower, more gentle tone" of the song.
[17]
In
The Quietus
, Verónica A. Bastardo wrote that the song is "a cosy approach to anxiety where whispering voices sing rawly about depression while a bright piano plays at the back, reminiscing hopefully."
[29]
Emma Saletta of
MTV News
described it as a "fresh spin on a ballad," acknowledging both BTS' honesty and the blend of their vocals with acoustic guitar.
[20]
Writing for
The Independent
, Annabel Nugent dubbed the track as "an apt anthem for the sad and sexy [..] moods of lockdown."
[30]
Exclaim!
writer Eva Zhu labelled the song "heartbreaking" and commended the lyrical themes as "too relatable."
[24]
Similarly,
AllMusic
's Neil Z. Yeung called the song "crushing" while praising BTS' "vulnerability and intimacy."
[31]
In a review published by
The Arts Desk
, Peter Quinn considered the song "touching" and said that it "offers a moment of plaintive, pandemic-related reflection."
[32]
Lexi Lane from
NBC News
wrote that the track is "the band's way to show millions of fans worldwide that everyone has been having negative thoughts, too."
[33]
Slant Magazine
'
s Sophia Ordaz called it a "pretty" ballad.

Billy Wolfe
William Harrison Wolfe
(July 4, 1896 - March 7, 1963) was a
professional wrestling
promoter who was active from the 1930s to the 1950s. Wolfe was the husband and manager of
Mildred Burke
and ran a traveling troupe of
women wrestlers
alongside her.
Early life
[
edit
]
Wolfe was the second child born to John and Lucinda Wolfe, in
Daviess County, Missouri
.
[1]
[2]
He was drafted into the military in
World War I
and began pursuing wrestling at a Kentucky duty station. As a competing middleweight, Wolfe claimed the Missouri State title in 1923, and established himself as a challenger to Charles “Midget” Fischer of
Wisconsin
.
[1]
He was revered by his peers for doing whatever was necessary to win a match.
Relocation to Kansas City
[
edit
]
He married Margaret Johnson on February 22, 1922 and celebrated their first child, George William Wolfe, known as “Billy Wolfe, Jr.”
[1]
After the birth of their second child, Violet, the Wolfe family moved to
Kansas City
. Billy decided to instruct women at his gymnasium. After a divorce from Margaret, Billy married wrestler
Barbara Ware
, known for competing with men.
[1]
Marriage to Mildred Burke
[
edit
]
His marriage to Barbara Ware failed. While training aspiring women wrestlers, he was drawn to a young brunette named Mildred Bliss. Bliss, was an office stenographer by day, but had outstanding muscle development, and was hoping to become a wrestler.
[1]
Wolfe tutored her and realized that she was the prospect for which he was waiting. The close proximity of training resulted in a relationship and ultimately marriage. Changing her name to
Mildred Burke
, she defeated
Clara Mortenson
for the
Women's World Championship
in January 1937.
[1]
In late 1949, Wolfe joined the
National Wrestling Alliance
, making his stable of 30 women available to all promoters.
[3]
At each show, he received a percentage of the gross, and his promotion of women grapplers earned him riches that resulted in extravagant living. On the road, he stood as a father figure to the women he trained and managed, but he also earned reputation as a womanizer. His marriage to Burke was not monogamous, as he enjoyed the companionship of women with whom he traveled.
[3]
[4]
Tensions emanated from the extramarital activity, and in 1952, Wolfe and Burke went their own ways. Wolfe retaliated as he froze Burke out of wrestling among all NWA channels.
[3]
Burke consulted
Jack Pfefer
for help. The Alliance attempted to reconcile the couple and the final result was that one would sell out to the other. Burke actually volunteered to sell for $50,000 but was rebuffed. On January 26, 1953, Wolfe sold to Burke, who created the company Attractions, Inc.
[3]
The deal was for $30,000, all alimony was waived and Wolfe was barred from participating for five years.
[3]
The pledge lasted only a few months as Wolfe started promoting wrestling in
Columbus, Ohio
. Wolfe tempted many grapplers by offering 50 percent of the proceeds. Burke challenged him by offering 60 percent of the proceeds from her promotion but Wolfe settled on the figure of 75 percent.
[3]
Controversy over competing promotions
[
edit
]
Attractions, Inc. went into bankruptcy and into the hands of receiver James Hoff of Columbus. Eight months later, Hoff named Wolfe as administrator and was approved by
Franklin County
Judge William Bryant.
[3]
In a memorandum dated August 20, 1953, Wolfe announced that he was the
booker
for Burke and her stable of 27 wrestlers.
Burke disputed this claim on August 26, 1953, stating that the issue was settled in the courts. She stated that her contract prohibited Wolfe from competing in wrestling and was in breach of the binding agreement.
[3]
Aligning herself with
Leroy McGuirk
, she hoped to be vindicated by the Alliance at their September 1953 meeting in Chicago.
[3]
The result was that the Alliance declined to recognize women's wrestling. Wolfe had regained his stake. The result was that his son's wife
June Byers
(real name DeAlva Eyvonnie Sibley), was touted as world champ following a tournament in
Baltimore
.
[5]
Wolfe's girlfriend
Nell Stewart
was recognized as Women's U.S. Titleholder.
[5]
Many women were loyal to Burke and refused to wrestle for Wolfe.
Discrediting Mildred Burke
[
edit
]
Despite the fact that the NWA declined to recognize women's wrestling, the Alliance was still at the center of many conflicts between Wolfe and Burke. In a letter to Alliance members on November 4, 1953, Burke refuted Wolfe's claim that she would wrestle only one woman grappler.
[5]
Despite listing 12 grapplers that she would work with, Wolfe used his influence to get her frozen from NWA members. The result was that her run in the Southeast with Cowboy Luttrall and Paul Jones in 1954 fizzled.
[5]
Adding insult to injury, Burke wrestled Wolfe's daughter-in-law June Byers. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in
Atlanta
and the match was a shoot.
[5]
By having the local commission in his corner, Wolfe slid a friendly referee into the match. Despite giving up the first fall with the intention of competing stronger in the second, Burke never had the opportunity.
[5]
Officials called the match, and the second fall never had a finish.
Burke left the ring believing that her title was safe because she had not lost two falls. Many in the press stated that Byers had defeated her and the image of Burke's championship was tarnishing.
[5]
Wolfe had done everything possible to discredit Burke and the result was one of the nastiest rivalries in wrestling history.
Death and legacy
[
edit
]
Negative stories about Wolfe by the women who wrestled for him are legend. In her autobiography Lillian Ellison (aka
The Fabulous Moolah
) recalls his extreme chauvinism (he turned to managing women wrestlers only after failing as a wrestler and as a manager of male wrestlers), his financial misdealings and routine
sexual harassment
of his "girls" before, during and after his marriage to Mildred Burke.
[4]
Due to his managerial contract with her he was able to leave Burke penniless when she divorced him, taking all of their marital assets and leaving her with nothing to show for decades of hundreds of wrestling matches per year. The horror stories of Wolfe led to the success of the far more ethical manager Jack Pfeffer and of Moolah herself. In her autobiography, Moolah ultimately felt great sorrow for Wolfe because of the number of personal tragedies he suffered later in life.
[6]
Despite being highly criticized for his morals, Wolfe was responsible for making women's wrestling profitable.
[7]
Instead of being viewed as a sideshow, Wolfe tried to make it respectable. Part of Wolfe's contributions to women's wrestling was the creation of a tag team title and the integration of African-American wrestlers.

Early life
Eilish with her mother,
Maggie Baird
, in November 2018
Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001.
[8]
She is the daughter of actress and teacher
Maggie Baird
[9]
[10]
and actor Patrick O'Connell,
[11]
both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours.
[12]
[13]
[14]
Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.
[15]
She was conceived via
in vitro fertilization
.
[16]
Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate was to be her middle name.
[17]
She was raised in the
Highland Park
neighborhood of Los Angeles.
[18]
[19]
Eilish and her brother Finneas were
homeschooled
by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.
[11]
[14]
Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting.
[20]
Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.
[21]
Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting.
[12]
[20]
Eilish also performed at talent shows and joined the
Los Angeles Children's Chorus
at age eight.
[22]
[20]
At age six, she started playing the ukulele.
[23]
She wrote her first "real" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series
The Walking Dead
from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.
[24]
[21]
Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for
crowd scenes
and worked on the films
Diary of a Wimpy Kid
,
Ramona and Beezus
, and the
X-Men
series
.
[20]
Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a
growth plate
injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.
[25]
[26]
[22]
Career
2015-2017:
Don't Smile at Me
Main article:
Don't Smile at Me
In 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band.
[26]
[22]
[13]
The first songs they recorded together were called "She's Broken" and "Fingers Crossed", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. "We recorded them and put them out on
SoundCloud
, just for fun," she recalled.
[27]
On November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song "
Ocean Eyes
". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys, before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals.
[13]
[28]
[22]
[26]
He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to
SoundCloud
, where Diaz could access and download it.
[26]
[22]
[29]
[30]
The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. Rukasin felt she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.
[35]
In January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which
Apple Music
signed Eilish to
A&R
company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract.
[33]
[12]
[32]
Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand
Chanel
, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.
[12]
On March 24, 2016, a music video for "Ocean Eyes" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel.

A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016.
[42]
It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.
[42]
In August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first heard "Ocean Eyes", signed her to Darkroom and
Interscope Records
.
[31]
[43]
He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as
Travis Scott
and
Chance the Rapper
, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a "persona and distinct aesthetic".
[25]
Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released "Six Feet Under" and "Ocean Eyes" as singles for digital download and
streaming
on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively.
[44]
[45]
On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for "Ocean Eyes" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.

A music video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ.

[62]
[63]
[64]
Eilish's team worked with
Spotify
, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, "Today's Top Hits".
[12]
The Baffler
described Eilish's sound as fitting into the "streambait" genre consisting of largely "mid-tempo, melancholy pop" influenced by
Lana Del Rey
, whose "singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production" shaped the aesthetic.
[65]
[12]
Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion.
[12]
In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their
Up Next
artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview with
Zane Lowe
on Apple Music's radio station
Beats 1
.

"

as a part of

soundtrack, was released in January 2021, almost two years after initially teasing the song.
[122]
The
R. J. Cutler
-directed documentary film
Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry
was released on Apple TV+ and in select movie theaters. The film was praised by critics and fans for its in-depth look at Eilish's personal life during her ascension to fame.
[123]
At the
63rd Annual Grammy Awards
, Eilish took home two awards: the
Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media
, for her
Bond theme
and the
Grammy Award for Record of the Year
for her 2019 single "
Everything I Wanted
". In her acceptance speech for Record of the Year, Eilish said that
Megan Thee Stallion
"deserved to win", but still thanked her fans and her brother Finneas for her award.
[124]
On April 27, 2021, Eilish announced on her
Instagram
account that her second album,
Happier Than Ever
, would be released on July 30, and the tracklist was made available on Apple Music. The album was released on various formats, including collectable vinyl and cassette colours.
[125]
[126]
The album's release was preceded by five singles: "My Future", "Therefore I Am", "
Your Power
",
[127]
"
Lost Cause
",
[128]
and "
NDA
",
[129]
and was accompanied by
the title track
. On December 2, 2021, Eilish announced an eco-friendly limited-edition vinyl version of
Happier Than Ever
made from recycled vinyl scraps. The collector's item was only made available at a number of Gucci stores around the world and included Gucci-branded nail stickers designed by the brand's creative director Alessandro Michele.
[130]
To further promote the album, Eilish worked with
Disney+
for the concert film
Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles
, released in September 2021,
[131]
[132]
and embarked on the
Happier Than Ever, The World Tour
, which began in February 2022 and concluded in April 2023.
[133]
In June 2021, Eilish was criticized online for videos in which she mouthed the anti-Asian slur "
chink
" while lip-syncing the song "
Fish
" by
Tyler, the Creator
,
[134]
[135]
while Matthew Tyler Vorce, her reported boyfriend at the time, received criticism for alleged social media posts in which he used offensive language and slurs against gay and Black people.
[138]
Eilish was also accused of
queerbaiting
after using the caption "I love girls" to promote the music video for "Lost Cause".
[139]
[140]
[

]
On June 22, she posted an apology to Instagram stories for her usage of "chink", saying that she was "appalled and embarrassed" by the video and that she was "13 or 14" at the time and did not know the slur was a derogatory term.
[141]
[142]
She also addressed a separate video of what was viewed as her mocking an Asian accent, writing that she was actually "speaking in a silly gibberish made up voice".
[141]
[142]
Reflecting on the events in a July 2021 interview, Eilish stated: "I said so many things then that I totally don't agree with now, or think the opposite thing. The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to."
[143]
Eilish during the
Happier Than Ever, The World Tour
(2022)
Eilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album's songs with Finneas in December 2021.
[144]
In a July 2022 interview with
Zane Lowe
for
Apple Music
, she commented that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023.
[145]
In 2022, Eilish won the
Academy Award for Best Original Song
for the song "
No Time to Die
" from the film
of the same name
, becoming the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.
[3]
That same year, she became the youngest headliner to date for two festivals, specifically
Glastonbury
and
Coachella
.
[146]
[147]
The
Pixar
film
Turning Red
was released that year, for which she and Finneas wrote three songs. These are "
Nobody Like U
", "U Know What's Up" and "1 True Love", which are performed by
Turning Red
's
fictional boy band 4*Town.
[148]
In June 2022, during her world tour's Manchester show, Eilish debuted the then-unreleased ballad "TV". The song references
the overturning
of
Roe v. Wade
, a case which made
abortion
a
constitutional right
in the US.
[149]
The next month, on July 21, she
surprise-released
the two-track EP
Guitar Songs
, which includes "TV" alongside "The 30th".
[150]
Eilish explained her decision to surprise-release the EP during the interview with Lowe. She told him that while work on her third studio album was coming soon, she refused to wait until that time to put "TV" and "The 30th" on a track list. She wanted to spread their messages to her fans as soon as possible, noting the immediacy of its lyrics: "These songs are really current for me, and they’re songs that I want to have said right now."
[151]
Another reason was Eilish had grown tired of doing heavy, traditional promotion for upcoming music. She wanted to release songs like she had been doing early in her career, previewing them for fans in live concerts before releasing them without much marketing.
[152]
[153]
Eilish worked with
Apple Music
to exclusively host a film of one of the
Happier Than Ever
tour concerts, specifically one of her shows at
The O2 Arena
in London. She billed the film as a way for fans who missed out on tickets to experience the tour for themselves, wanting more people to recognize her for her showmanship live.
[154]
[155]
[156]
Three concerts, titled Happier Than Ever, The Hometown Encore, were held at the
Kia Forum
in
Inglewood, California
from December 13 to 16, 2022, as part of the tour.
[157]
[158]
Eilish wrote the song "
What Was I Made For?
" for the soundtrack of the 2023 movie
Barbie
. According to statements posted on the singer's statements on social media, she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the movie during its production.
[159]
Eilish made her acting debut in
Amazon Prime Video
's
Swarm
.
[160]
She played the role of Eva, the leader of a cult inspired by
NXIVM
, and received positive reviews for her character.

[167]
Avery Stone of

described her vocals as "ethereal",
[168]
and
Maura Johnston
of
Rolling Stone
characterized them as "whispery".
[169]
Doreen St. Félix
of
The New Yorker
opined that she has a "husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy".
[170]
Music critic
Robert Christgau
wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also "reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become", describing her soprano as "too diminutive for vocal calisthenics", adding that her "playful version of teen-
goth
angst" and "
electro
-saturated debut album" captivated a diverse audience.
[171]

[172]
dark pop,
[173]

Eilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting.
[182]
[183]
Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music, and also performs in live shows.
[184]
[182]
Eilish and Finneas "like to completely make up things and become characters" and "have songs that are really fictional".
[183]
Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences.
[183]
They try to write "really interesting and conversational" lyrics: "We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about."
[183]
Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to "write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own".
[185]
When he writes with Eilish, he tries "to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.
[185]
Eilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience.
[186]
In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song "
Xanny
".

[183]
[228]
[229]

[230]
In May 2019, Eilish appeared in a
Calvin Klein
advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body.

in 2021, which had the theme "In America: A Lexicon of Fashion", wearing an
Oscar de la Renta
gown under the condition that the fashion house would permanently end its use of real fur.

[238]

Activin receptor type-2B
is a
protein
that in humans is encoded by the
ACVR2B
gene
.
[5]
[6]
[7]
ACVR2B is an
activin type 2 receptor
.
Function
[
edit
]
Activins
are dimeric growth and differentiation factors which belong to the
transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-beta) superfamily of structurally related signaling proteins. Activins signal through a heteromeric complex of
receptor serine kinases
which include at least two type I (I and IB) and two type II (II and IIB) receptors. These receptors are all transmembrane proteins, composed of a ligand-binding extracellular domain with
cysteine
-rich region, a
transmembrane domain
, and a
cytoplasmic
domain with predicted serine/threonine specificity. Type I receptors are essential for signaling; and type II receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression of type I receptors. Type I and II receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding, resulting in
phosphorylation
of type I receptors by type II receptors. Type II receptors are considered to be constitutively active kinases. This gene encodes activin A type IIB receptor, which displays a 3- to 4-fold higher affinity for the ligand than activin A type II receptor.

Edison Reginald Townsend
(July 23, 1917 - April 22, 1980) was a
Liberian
journalist and statesman known for the establishment of Liberia's Information Services. He served as Secretary of Information and Cultural Affairs under President
William Tubman
, and as Minister of State for Presidential Affairs under President
William Tolbert
. In 1979 he was elected National Chairman of the True Whig Party. Following the
1980 Liberian coup d'état
of President Tolbert on April 12, 1980, he and several other members of the Tolbert administration were put on trial and without due process executed by firing squad on April 22, 1980.
[1]
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Edison Reginald “Reggie” Townsend was born in Schieffelin, Marshall Territory,
Liberia
; the fifth of seven children to Edward and Annie Townsend née Walker. His grandparents immigrated to Liberia from the
United States
and from
Barbados
in the 1800s. Townsend's early education began at Lott Carey Mission in Brewerville, Liberia, then at Liberia College High School. He earned the opportunity to travel to the United States to continue his studies; first at the
American University
in Washington, D.C. from 1950-1952, and then at
Michigan State College
in East Lansing, Michigan where he received an M.A. in Journalism. After completing his studies and returning to Liberia, Townsend began working as a journalist, and in 1954 was selected to be Press Secretary to President
William Tubman
.
Civil servant and statesman
[
edit
]
As Press Secretary, Townsend prepared speeches for the president, oversaw and edited presidential papers for publishing, and accompanied the president on state visits. He realized the need for a public medium, and suggested to President Tubman the need to develop and improve information services in the country. President Tubman supported this endeavor and subsequently appointed him Chief of the Information Bureau at the Department of State (1955-1958). During his services at the Information Bureau, Townsend implemented an effective medium to keep the people of Liberia informed about their government and its affairs, and domestic and international news at home and abroad. He went on to become Director of the Liberian Information Service (LIS) (1958-1964), following an act establishing it by the Liberian Legislature. Under Townsend's leadership, Liberia's information services greatly expanded providing print media and on-air radio and television broadcasting, which boosted tourism and appreciation of the Liberian culture.  In 1960 the formation of the Liberian Broadcasting Corporation (ELBC) was established, followed by the establishment of television services (ELTV) in 1964. In 1965, President Tubman named him Secretary of the Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, and later elevated the position to cabinet level.
In 1963, along with Deputy for Cultural Affairs,
Bai T. Moore
, Townsend led the founding of the National Cultural Center with the strong backing of President Tubman.
[2]
Moore and Townsend worked steadfastly together with the many tribal liaisons throughout the country to develop Liberia's National Cultural Center at Kendejah, Marshall Territory. President Tubman opened the Center in 1964, which was described as a “panorama of tribal life, customs and traditions with thirty-one tribal huts and palava kitchens, designed and built by master builders from Liberia's 16 major tribes.”
[3]
The goal of the Center was to project the cultural image of the country, encourage and improve indigenous arts and crafts, provide a base for the National Cultural Troupe, and preserve the country's traditional art forms. Following the coup d'état in 1980, the operations and activities of the Center were not maintained, and as a result of the civil wars in the early 1990s the facilities suffered damage and fell into disrepair. Many of its occupants became dislocated and fled. The facilities were subsequently removed and the land converted to commercial use and today is occupied by the Robert L. Johnson Kendeja Resort and Villas.
[4]
Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs, and Tourism
When William R. Tolbert was elected President of Liberia, he appointed Townsend Minister of State for Presidential Affairs (1972-1979). In this role, Townsend directed and oversaw the office of the president, assisted in the administration and affairs of the cabinet, ensured the goals and agenda set forth by the president and cabinet progressed and were achieved, oversaw the development of presidential speeches, and acted on behalf of the president in his absence. Townsend along with then Foreign Minister
Cecil Dennis
helped lead the planning, coordination, and support for the Government of Liberia's hosting of the 32nd Summit of the Organization of African Unity in 1979.
In April 1979, Townsend was voted in as the 16th National Chairman of the True Whig Party of Liberia, the ruling party of the era.
[5]
His selection came amidst a time when the party was struggling to transition from one that had a history of dominance by Americo-Liberians to one that needed to broaden its membership base to be inclusive of all members of Liberian society, including indigenous tribes. Known for his uncanny ability to bridge differences between various parties, Townsend won overwhelming approval to lead the party into this next phase. President Tolbert lauded his selection as he too had a partner to help with his “mats to mattresses” and signature “Rally Time” movement to raise the living standards of all Liberians.
Other involvement
[
edit
]
Townsend was an active member of the Presbyterian Church of Liberia, and was ordained Moderator of the Presbytery of Liberia in November 1977.  He was the first layperson ever to have been elevated to Moderator since the founding of the church in Liberia in 1833.  
Townsend was also a freemason and an active member of the Grand Lodge of the
Masonic Order of Liberia
.  In late 1979 he was selected as the Thirty-Second Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Masons 33.
[6]
Coup d’etat and death
[
edit
]
On April 12, 1980, President Tolbert was overthrown and executed by militants headed by master sergeant
Samuel Doe
and some enlisted men of the Liberian Army.  Townsend and nearly all of Tolbert's cabinet ministers and some members of the True Whig Party were charged with “high treason, rampant corruption, misuse of public office and gross violation of the civil and human rights of the Liberian people.”
[7]
[8]
[9]
Without due legal process they were found guilty and summarily sentenced to death and executed by firing squad at Barclay Beach in Monrovia on April 22, 1980, ten days after the overthrow of Tolbert. Besides Townsend, the following government officials were executed:  Frank E. Tolbert, brother of President William Tolbert and President Pro-Temp of the Liberian Senate;
Cecil Dennis
, Minister of Foreign Affairs;  Cyril Bright, former Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs;  Chief Justice
James A. A. Pierre
;
Richard Abrom Henries
, Speaker of the House of Representatives;  Frank J. Stewart, Sr, Director of the Budget;  John W. Sherman, Assistant Minister of Commerce and Trade;  P. Clarence Parker II, Chairman of the National Investment Council and Treasurer of the True Whig Party;  James T. Phillips, former Minister of Finance and former Minister of Agriculture;  David Franklin Neal, former Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs;  Joseph J. Chesson, Sr, Minister of Justice; and Charles T. O. King, Deputy Minister for Agriculture.
Personal

E. Reginald Townsend was married twice; first to Sophronia Richards, and then to Evelyn Diggs. At the time of his untimely death in 1980 he was survived by his widow, seven children, and many members of his extended family.

Statistics

Cikarang Dry Port (CDP)
is a
dry port
located within
Kota Jababeka
at
Cikarang
,
West Java
,
Indonesia
.  CDP was established in 2010 with a total area of 200 hectares. It is operated by PT Cikarang Inland Port, a subsidiary of publicly listed
PT Jababeka Tbk
, and becomes the first and only Integrated Customs Services Zone in
Indonesia
.
[1]
As an inland dry port model, CDP serves as a port extension providing solution to chronic congestion and delays at the major import export gateway of
Tanjung Priok
. The main objective is simply to cut the dwelling time from 3.2 days to the government target of 2.5 days.
[2]
To proceed 2.5 days dwelling time, CDP is involved by the government to maximize its function. It has been designed in such a way to integrate with
Tanjung Priok
. The concept is that when
Tanjung Priok
has completely accomplished the loading and unloading activities, then CDP runs the next stage i.e. port clearance. To accelerate its process, a freight train will carry containers from the seaport to CDP for inspection, administration, and quarantine purposes. For export, the similar process can also be done. The integration between
Tanjung Priok
and CDP is believed to be able to increase port capacity up to 8 million TEUs per year.
[3]
With CDP, the entire supply chain is coordinated and synchronized to facilitate productivity - a crucial matter for an industrial business development.
[3]
CDP itself is able to accommodate 250 thousand TEUs.

Traffic solutions
[
edit
]
The government is aware that CDP can bring other added value that is to reduce traffic between ports and industrial estates. Theoretically, CDP integration with
Tanjung Priok
can reduce road congestion by 30 percent.
[4]
This contribution in turns generates fuel consumption efficiency estimated at 190 billion rupiahs per year.
[4]
Access
[
edit
]
Under government's support, CDP is supported by the access of toll roads and railway system.
[5]
In addition, new access to CDP is currently being developed. The National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and Indonesia Port Corporation region II (
Pelindo II
) plans to build an inland waterways.
[6]
The project is to optimize an existing river namely Cikarang Bekasi Laut (CBL) by widening the river. The route expands from
Tanjung Priok
Port to CDP and will be utilized as a new transportation alternative. It will be more efficient in terms of time, energy and finance. No trucking activities are needed and the traffic hassle can be reduced especially at Inner Jakarta toll road and Jakarta - Cikampek toll road. Utilizing the river also means the government does not have to make a new toll road. In essence, the development of inland waterway or Cikarang Bekasi Laut (CBL) aims to optimize the potential of the river channel as an alternative transportation logistics that will connect off
Tanjung Priok
offshore with rural areas.

Stakeholders
[
edit
]
As CDP offers services in cargo handling and logistics, it deals much with the customs. But not merely with the customs, the logistics service handled involves many stakeholders from both the government and the private sector. These stakeholders include exporters, importers, vessels providers, terminal operators, container freight stations, bonded warehouses, trucking and forwarding agents, third party logistics (3PL), empty container depots as well as banking and other supporting facilities.
[5]
International port code
[
edit
]
CDP is legally permitted to deliver exported goods as well as receipt of imported goods to and from all over the world. This possibility is due to CDP having been registered in an international port network and already has a special and unique code which is IDJBK. This allows CDP to become an official Port of Origin and Port of Destination.

In the 1890s, Nikitin's brothers opened a first circus-zoo in Baku. In 1904, they built the first Circus-building in the East on the intersection of Nizami street and Bul-Bul Avenue - in the place of the present Nasimi garden. But it burned in 1906. In 1916, Yefimovs built another circus building in the place of the destroyed circus-building of Nikitin's brothers. It burned again in December 1924, and after a while Kudryavtsev set up his own circus here.
In the 1930s, branch of the Baku Circus was founded. Members of this branch were Pahlevanis of village and people walking on a tight rope. In 1945, a collective of Azerbaijani circus was organized in the
Azerbaijan SSR
, it included estrade actors, who performed tricks in the circus and amateur participants with artistic skills.
[1]
The composer
Uzeyir Hajibeyov
prepared the first program of the collective named "Wedding of Azerbaijan". This program was shown during  1946 - 1951, firstly in Baku, then in Moscow and other cities of the former USSR. Ancient custom and traditions of Azerbaijan, national wedding traditions, national dances and circus numbers were performed at scene during this program. Famous Azerbaijani composers, poets, ballet masters and artists worked along with the collective of the circus. Starting from 1946, troupe of Baku Circus had regular tours in cities of the
USSR
, the collective performed programs “We are from Baku” and “Dawn over the Rock”. Besides the USSR they had tours in
Southern Europe
,
Asia
,
Africa
and the
United States
.
[2]
In the early 1950s, the artistic director of the team, Mikail Jabrayilov, added examples from the poems of
Samed Vurgun
to the content of the program.
In 1959, the circus team demonstrated "We are from Baku" program in the 2nd Azerbaijan Literature and Art Decade in Moscow. In 1966, the members of the Azerbaijani Circus team changed completely and on April 15 of the same year, the team demonstrated a circus performance on the scene of the Baku Circus, entitled "Qayada nişanə" (Sign on the rock).
In 1967, a new building of Baku Circus equipped with necessary equipment for full operation of the circus was built according to architects E. Ismayilov and F. Leontyev's project. There are 2000 seats in the new building.
[3]
The Circus teams of neighboring countries came in Baku in order to perform in the new arena.
After the collapse of the USSR, ties between the former republics was broken and economic difficulties was created, that is why, the troupe, which operated in the Baku Circus in the 1990s, almost stopped its activity.

Glenn Taylor
is an Australian
Logie Award
-winning former television presenter.
He is best known for co-anchoring
Seven News
on
HSV-7
in Melbourne from 1988 to 1991 and
Ten News
on
TVQ-10
in Brisbane from 1992 to 1998.
Career
[
edit
]
Taylor commenced his media career at
ABC Radio Adelaide
in the late 1960's.
[1]
He moved into television in the mid 1970's, appearing on the
ABC
's Adelaide television station
ABS-2
, presenting
Today at One
and reporting for
This Day Tonight
.
[2]
[3]
[4]
In 1979, he joined
QTQ-9
in Brisbane where he hosted a local current affairs program called
Today Tonight
(unrelated to the Seven Network's
Today Tonight
of the same name which commenced in 1995).
[1]
In 1980, Taylor was "poached" by rival Brisbane station
BTQ-7
to host their own local current affairs program called
State Affair
.
[5]
Taylor defended the decision to leave QTQ to go to BTQ despite there being a 'no poaching' agreement amongst the Brisbane television stations.
[6]
[7]
When
State Affair
was axed in 1986, Taylor briefly moved to Channel 7's Perth station
TVW-7
where he began anchoring the local edition of
Seven News
following the departure of Peter Waltham.
[8]
In late 1987, it was announced that Taylor had been appointed as a co-anchor for Seven's hour-long Melbourne news, alongside
Jennifer Keyte
.
[9]
[10]
He continued this role until 1991 when Seven decided to revert the hour-long bulletin back to 30 minutes with Keyte continuing on as sole anchor.
[11]
Taylor then returned to Brisbane where he commenced co-anchoring
Ten News
.
[12]
Initially, he was paired with
Marie-Louise Theile
until she left in 1993 and then with
Tracey Spicer
from 1994 to 1996 before Theile returned in 1997.
Network Ten
sacked Taylor from the role after an on-air incident in 1998.
[1]
[13]
After Theile had introduced a story about swimmer
Richard Upton
(who had tested positive to a banned drug) being relieved he hadn't "been suspended", Taylor added "...by his
testicles
."
[1]
[14]
[15]
After the sacking, the network and Taylor reached an out of court settlement.
[13]
He told Nine's local current affairs program
Extra
in September 1998: "I admit I made the remark but I didn't think it was blasphemous or profane, and I thought the penalty far outweighed the indiscretion on my part."
[1]
In 2000, Taylor accused the network of having
double standards
when they didn't sack Theile after she called her husband an "arsehole" whilst on air during a conversation with Taylor's successor Geoff Mullins when they thought station was still in a commercial break.
[16]
Awards
[
edit
]
Taylor won
Logie Awards
for Most Popular Male Personality (Queensland) in 1980, 1984 and 1986.
[17]
[18]
[19]
QTQ-9's
Today Tonight
also won a Logie in March 1980 for Most Popular Show (Queensland) while Taylor was still host, prior to being poached by BTQ-7 in May 1980.

The
Lüneburg-Soltau Light Railway Company
(
German
:
Kleinbahn Lüneburg-Soltau GmbH
) was founded on 15 February 1911 by the
Prussian state
, the
Province of Hanover
and the districts of
Lüneburg
and
Soltau
in North
Germany
. It opened its only line, a
Kleinbahn
from Lüneburg to Soltau
, on 13 June 1913. This 57 km long,
standard gauge
'hill railway' (
Gebirgsbahn
) ran from Lüneburg through the middle of the Lüneburg Heath via Amelinghausen-Sottorf and Hützel. Here it was joined by the
Kleinbahn Winsen-Evendorf-Hützel
(
Luhebahn
). Finally, it reached the railway hub of Soltau.
In 1920 the railway company also took over
running powers
for the
Soltau-Neuenkirchen railway
, for which it also provided rolling stock and staff.
Operation of both railways from 1 June 1923 to July 1944 became the responsibility of the
State Light Railway Office in the Province of Hanover
(
Landeskleinbahnamtes der Provinz Hannover
).
The
Kleinbahn
company merged with the
Soltau-Neuenkirchen Light Railway
Company (
Kleinbahn Soltau-Neuenkirchen GmbH
) on 1 January 1944 to become the
Lüneburg-Soltau Railway Company
(
Lüneburg−Soltauer Eisenbahn GmbH
), but not long afterwards, on 11 July 1944 it was transferred into the
East Hanoverian Railways
.

Certified Public Accountant
(
CPA
) is the title of qualified
accountants
in numerous countries in the
English-speaking world
. It is generally equivalent to the title of
chartered accountant
in other English-speaking countries. In the
United States
, the CPA is a license to provide
accounting
services to the public. It is awarded by each of the 50 states for practice in that state. Additionally, all states except Hawaii have passed mobility laws to allow CPAs from other states to practice in their state. State licensing requirements vary, but the minimum standard requirements include passing the
Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination
, 150 semester units of college education,
[1]
and one year of accounting-related experience.
Continuing professional education (CPE) is also required to maintain licensure. Individuals who have been awarded the CPA but have lapsed in the fulfillment of the required CPE or who have requested conversion to inactive status are in many states permitted to use the designation "CPA Inactive" or an equivalent phrase. In most U.S. states, only CPAs are legally able to provide attestation (including auditing) opinions on
financial statements
. Many CPAs are members of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and their state CPA society.
State laws vary widely regarding whether a non-CPA is even allowed to use the title "accountant". For example,
Texas
prohibits the use of the designations "accountant" and "auditor" by a person not certified as a Texas CPA, unless that person is a CPA in another state, is a non-resident of Texas, and otherwise meets the requirements for practice in Texas by out-of-state CPA firms and practitioners.
[2]
CPA in various countries
[
edit
]
In the United States, "CPA" is an initialism for Certified Public Accountant which is a designation given by a state governing agency, whereas other countries around the world have their own designations, which may be equivalent to "CPA".
[3]
In the United Kingdom, "CPA" is an initialism for Certified Public Accountant as well, but refers to an accounting and finance professional who is a member of the
Certified Public Accountants Association
(formerly the Association of Certified Public Accountants).
[4]
In Australia, the term "CPA" is an initialism for Certified Practicing Accountant.
[5]
To become a CPA in Australia, it also requires a certain amount of education and experience to be eligible working in some specific areas in the accounting field.
[6]
In Canada, "CPA" is an initialism for
Chartered Professional Accountant
. This designation is for someone who would like to be a Canadian CPA. In order to be qualified for this certificate, candidates who major in accounting will get accepted to enter CPA Professional Education Program (CPA PEP).
[7]
Provinces in Canada also allow non-accounting majors and international candidates to meet the requirements if they get into the CPA Prerequisite Education Program (CPA PREP).
History of profession
[
edit
]
In 1660, the first person who would conduct an audit was chosen in order to be able to manage the money that was raised by England in Virginia, United States. With the help of chartered accountants from England and Scotland for training Americans to learn the procedures of accounting, many firms were established in America. The first American one was in 1895.
[8]
On July 28, 1882, the Institute of Accountants and Bookkeepers of the City of New York became the first accounting corporation which supports the need of people in the accounting field and for educational purposes.
[9]
With the accountancy and industry growing in the world, the need of looking for services from professional accountants who had higher standards and were recognized had been considered. In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants was created to set moral standards for the practice of accounting.
[10]
On April 17, 1896, Chapter 312 of the Laws of the State of New York established that the Regents of the University of the State of New York would provide a Certificate of Public Accountancy to individuals over age 21, of good moral character, and who possessed or intended to declare citizenship in the United States with appropriate accounting education or experience either through examination or previous experience. This was the first time the title "Certified Public Accountant" was regulated. Examinations were held in both
Buffalo
and
New York City
.
Frank Broaker
was licensee #1 and he received his certificate solely through previous experience as a public accountant and did not take an examination, commonly referred to as grandfathering. Broaker died on November 12, 1941. The first person to receive the CPA through examination and previous experience was
Joseph Hardcastle
, who would go on to become an accounting theorist and
New York University
professor
. Hardcastle died on June 16, 1906, after being thrown from a horse after an accident with a wagon. The Chapter was introduced by New York Senator
Albert Wray
, New York Assemblyman
Henry Marshall
, and signed by New York
Governor Morton
as part of business reform. The Regents appointed a Board of Examiners, similar to today's
NASBA
, the first members of which were
Charles Sprague
,
Frank Broaker
, and
C. W. Haskins
[11]
[12]
Many accounting professionals believed the 150 credit requirement—implemented in several states first in 1988 and then expanded to nearly all states in 2001—would lead to more knowledgeable, experienced CPAs. The National Association of State Board of Accountancy (NASBA) collected and analyzed data from 1996 to 1998 to verify the effectiveness of the measure. Researchers studied more than 116,000 candidates who took the exam between 1996 and 1998. 33% of respondents had more than 150 college credit hours, while 67% had less than 150 credit hours. The research reveals that for candidates with less than 150 credits, only 13% passed the CPA exam on their first try. Conversely, for candidates with 150 or more credits, 21% passed the CPA exam on their first try. Some suggest extraneous variables—including the additional study time those possessing 150 credits likely have while still enrolled in university—could distort the verifiability of the study.

Services provided
[
edit
]
One important function performed by CPAs relates to
assurance services
. The most commonly performed assurance services are
financial audit
services where CPAs attest to the reasonableness of disclosures, the freedom from material misstatement, and the adherence to the applicable
generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) in financial statements.
[13]
CPAs can also be employed within corporations (termed "the private sector" or "industry") in finance or operations positions such as financial analyst, finance manager, controller, chief financial officer (CFO), or chief executive officer (CEO). These CPAs do not provide services directly to the public.
Although some CPA firms serve as business consultants, the consulting role has been under scrutiny following the
Enron scandal
where
Arthur Andersen
simultaneously provided audit and consulting services which affected its ability to maintain independence in its audit duties. This incident resulted in many accounting firms divesting their consulting divisions, but this trend has since reversed. In audit engagements, CPAs are (and have always been) required by professional standards and Federal and State laws to maintain independence (both in fact and in appearance) from the entity for which they are conducting an attestation (audit and review) engagement. Although most individual CPAs who work as consultants do not also work as auditors, if the CPA firm is auditing the same company that the firm also does consulting work for, then there is a conflict of interest. This conflict voids the CPA firm's independence for multiple reasons, including: the CPA firm would be auditing its own work or the work the firm suggested, and, the CPA firm may be pressured into unduly giving a positive (unmodified) audit opinion so as not to jeopardize the consulting revenue the firm receives from the client.
CPAs also have a niche within the income tax return preparation industry. Many small to mid-sized firms have both a tax and an auditing department. Along with attorneys and
Enrolled Agents
, CPAs may represent taxpayers in matters before the
Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). Although the IRS regulates the practice of tax representation, it has no authority to regulate tax return preparers.
[14]
Some states also allow unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants. For example, California allows unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants if they work under the control and supervision of a CPA.
[15]
However, the California Board of Accountancy itself has determined that the terms "accountant" and "accounting" are misleading to members of the public, many of whom believe that a person who uses these terms must be licensed. As part of the California Poll, survey research showed that 55 percent of Californians believe that a person who advertises as an "accountant" must be licensed, 26 percent did not believe a license was required, and 19 percent did not know.
[16]
Whether providing services directly to the public or employed by corporations or associations, CPAs can operate in virtually any area of finance including:
Assurance
and attestation services
Corporate finance
(merger and acquisition, initial public offerings, share and debt issuings)
Corporate governance
Estate planning
Financial accounting
Governmental accounting
Financial analysis
Financial planning
Forensic accounting
(preventing, detecting, and investigating financial frauds)

Management consulting
and performance management

CPA exam
[
edit

Main article:
Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination
To become a CPA in the United States, the candidate must sit for and pass the
Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination
(Uniform CPA Exam), which is set by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(
AICPA
) and administered by the
National Association of State Boards of Accountancy
(NASBA). The Uniform CPA Exam consists of the following sections: Auditing and Attestation (AUD), Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), Regulation (REG), and Business Environment Concepts (BEC). The CPA designation was first established in law in New York State on April 17, 1896.
[17]
To qualify for the
Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination
in the United States, individuals typically need a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution with a minimum number of accounting and business-related credit hours (ranging from 120 to 150), and specific coursework in subjects such as auditing and financial accounting. Additional educational requirements, like a master's degree, may be necessary in some states. Residency and citizenship requirements, if applicable, vary by state. Candidates must apply through their state's Board of Accountancy, pay the requisite fees, and may need to pass an ethics exam. While work experience is not typically required for the exam itself, it is necessary for CPA licensure. Requirements can also vary by state, so it's essential to check with the specific
state's Board of Accountancy
for precise details.
[18]
Other requirements
[
edit
]
Although the CPA exam is uniform, licensing and certification requirements are imposed separately by each state's laws and therefore vary from state to state. Some states have a two-tier system whereby an individual would first become certified—usually by passing the Uniform CPA Exam. That individual would then later be eligible to be licensed once a certain amount of work experience is accomplished. Other states have a one-tier system whereby an individual would be certified and licensed at the same time when both the CPA exam is passed and the work experience requirement has been met. Two-tier states include
Alabama
,
Florida
,
Illinois
,
Montana
, and
Nebraska
. The trend is for two-tier states to gradually move towards a one-tier system. Since 2002, the state boards of accountancy in
Washington
and
South Dakota
have ceased issuing CPA "certificates" and instead issue CPA "licenses". Illinois planned to follow suit in 2012.
[19]
[
needs update
]
A number of states are two-tiered, but require work experience for the CPA certificate, such as
Ohio
and Pennsylvania.
[20]
Like other professionals, CPAs are required to take
continuing education
courses toward
continuing professional development
(continuing professional education [CPE]) to renew their license. Requirements vary by state (Wisconsin does not require any CPE for CPAs
[21]
[22]
) but the vast majority require an average of 40 hours of CPE every year with a minimum of 20 hours per calendar year. The requirement can be fulfilled through attending live seminars, webcast seminars, or through self-study (textbooks, videos, online courses, all of which require a test to receive credit).
[23]
In general, state boards accept group live and group internet-based credits for all credit requirements, while some states cap the number of credits obtained through the self-study format. All CPAs are encouraged to periodically review their state requirements.
[24]
As part of the CPE requirement, most states require their CPAs to take an ethics course at some frequency (such as every or every other renewal period). Ethics requirements vary by state and the courses range from 2-8 hours. AICPA guidelines (which are adopted by many state boards) grant licensees 1 hour of CPE credit for every 50 minutes of instruction.
[25]
[26]
Loss of licensure
[
edit
]
A CPA license may be suspended or revoked for various reasons. Common reasons include these:
Allowing the license to lapse without renewing in a timely manner.
Performing attestation services under an unlicensed/unregistered CPA firm or under a CPA firm permit which has expired.
Continuing to hold out as an active CPA on an expired license, which includes continued use of the CPA title on business cards, letterhead, office signage, correspondence, etc. after the license has expired.
Using fraud or deceit in obtaining or renewing the CPA license, the most common occurrence being misrepresenting or falsifying compliance with or completion of the continuing education requirements as a condition for renewal.
Being suspended or barred from practicing before another regulatory body such as the SEC or the IRS.
"Discreditable acts", which can include
failure to follow applicable standards (such as auditing standards when examining financial statements, or tax code when preparing tax returns); or
violation of felony or serious misdemeanor criminal laws, which may or not be related to the practice of accountancy. (A notable example of a CPA whose license was revoked for non-financial related criminal activity is
John Battaglia
, convicted of the capital murders of his children).
[27]
Impact of technology
[
edit
]
Many tasks that a CPA used to do while working have now been automated. Therefore current and future CPAs are required to do more complex tasks with technology as the simpler tasks have become automated. An example of a more complex task would include analyzing and interpreting data using a visualization software. Technology is used regularly in the job to the point where technological proficiency is needed when starting as a CPA.
[28]
Since technological proficiency is more important than in prior years, accounting organizations have begun starting to teach technology within the accounting curricula in colleges and universities. One big change was in 2013, when the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) mandated that information technology be included in all accredited accounting programs. The transition to add information technology has not been one without challenges. One specific challenge with regards to adding information technology into accounting curricula is the balance of preparing students for the CPA exam and preparing to work as a CPA following graduation. Preparing for the CPA exam and preparing to work as a CPA after graduation can be different, making this difficult for professors and schools to figure out what to include in their curricula. Instructors generally agree that including data analytics should be included when teaching about accounting information systems as a whole but few instructors think that data analytics should be in the entire accounting curricula at schools.
[28]
Demographics of CPAs
[
edit
]
A disparity exists among the demographics of AICPA members, specifically as it relates to class and gender. Between 1976 and 2005, 77% of CPAs were either middle or upper class and nearly half of all CPA candidates belonged to an upper middle class socioeconomic background. Although AICPA membership is predominated by individuals from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds, 20% of AICPA members were lower class between 1976 and 2005. This indicates that the CPA profession is not exclusionary, but rather that it provides upward social and economic mobility. While women only accounted for 2.4% of all CPAs between 1934 and 1975, 50-60% of all hiring's by CPA firms were women between 2001 and 2010. Considering the unique barriers female CPAs may experience within the accounting profession, it is theorized that female CPAs come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds to overcome any gender bias they may experience. This would elucidate the higher prevalence of wealthy AICPA members who are women. These findings indicate that the demographic discrepancies among AICPA members have narrowed significantly in recent years.
[29]
Practice mobility: the substantial equivalency rule
[
edit
]
An accountant is required to meet the legal requirements of any state in which the accountant wishes to practice. In recent years, practice mobility for CPAs has become a major business concern for CPAs and their clients. Practice mobility for CPAs is the general ability of a licensee in good standing from a substantially equivalent state to gain practice privilege outside of the practitioner's home state without getting an additional license in the state where the CPA will serve a client or an employer. In today's digital age, many organizations require the professional services of CPAs to conduct business on an interstate and international basis and have compliance responsibilities in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, the practice of CPAs often extends across state lines and international boundaries.
[30]
Differing requirements for CPA certification, reciprocity, temporary practice and other aspects of state accountancy legislation in the 55 U.S. licensing jurisdictions (the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) make the interstate practice and mobility of CPAs more complicated. By removing boundaries to practice in the U.S., CPAs are able to more readily serve individuals and businesses in need of their expertise. At the same time, the state board of accountancy's ability to discipline is enhanced by being based on a CPA and the CPA firm's performance of services (either physically, electronically or otherwise within a state), rather than being based on whether a state license is held.
[30]
The
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(AICPA) and the
National Association of State Boards of Accountancy
(NASBA) have analyzed the current system for gaining practice privileges across state lines and have endorsed a uniform mobility system. This model approach is detailed through the
substantial equivalency
provision (Section 23) of the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The UAA is an "evergreen" model licensing law co-developed, maintained, reviewed and updated by the AICPA and NASBA. The model provides a uniform approach to regulation of the accounting profession.
[30]
Uniform adoption of the UAA's substantial equivalency provision creates a system similar to the nation's driver's license program by providing CPAs with mobility while retaining and strengthening state boards’ ability to protect the public interest. The system enables consumers to receive timely services from the CPA best suited to the job, regardless of location, and without the hindrances of unnecessary filings, forms and increased costs that do not protect the public interest.
[30]
As of October 2012, a total of 49 out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia had passed mobility laws and were in the implementation and navigation phases.
[31]
Only the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
, the
Virgin Islands
,
Hawaii
,
Puerto Rico
, and
Guam
have not passed mobility laws. A California mobility law went into effect July 1, 2013.
[32]
The District of Columbia passed mobility laws effective on October 1, 2012.
[33]
AICPA membership
[
edit
]
The CPA designation is granted by individual state boards, not the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(AICPA). Membership in the AICPA is not obligatory for CPAs, although some CPAs do join. To become a full member of AICPA, the applicant must hold a valid CPA certificate or license from at least one of the fifty-five U.S. state/territory boards of accountancy; some additional requirements apply.
AICPA members approved a proposed bylaw amendment to make eligible for voting membership individuals who previously held a CPA
[34]
certificate/license or have met all the requirements for CPA certification in accordance with the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The AICPA announced its plan to accept applications from individuals meeting these criteria, beginning no later than January 1, 2011.

Spanish merchant sailor (1872-1938)
Vicenç Albert Ballester i Camps
(September 18, 1872 in
Barcelona
- August 15, 1938 in
El Masnou
) was a
Spanish
politician,
Catalan
nationalist
, considered by some to be the designer and promoter of the "
estelada
",
Catalonia's independence
flag.
[1]
Biography
[
edit
]
Ballester was the son of Vicenç Ballester (from
Calaf
,
Anoia
) and Cristina Camps (from
Lleida
), where the family owned lands and flour mills. He had early ties to the town of
El Masnou
, having worked there and later raised a family there. He began his studies in
seamanship
in 1890, having already learned to sail in El Masnou.
[2]
After four years, in 1894, he obtained his merchant pilot's license which allowed him to sail as a captain. Nevertheless, his career in the merchant marine was cut short for health reasons: he had osseous problems in one of his knees. This did not, however, keep Ballester from going to
Cuba
, in 1898 when the Caribbean island declared its independence. Upon his return to El Masnou he became a partner and employee in a company that commercialized
acetylene gas
, used at the time for street lighting.
Once Ballester established himself more in El Masnou, he began to participate in political activities promoting
Catalan nationalism
, especially through several Catalanist publications.
[3]
In 1901 he became a member of the Foment Autonomista Català and head of
La Reixa
[
ca
]
, and as such organised the acts of the September 11, 1908 (
Catalonia's National Day
) which resulted in a prison sentence. He was also a member of the
Associació Protectora de l'Ensenyança Catalana
[
ca
]
(Association for the Protection of Education in Catalan) and in 1903 founded the magazine La Tralla writing under the pseudonym VIC (whose initials in Catalan stand for "Long Live the Independence of Catalonia") and VICIME ("Long Live the Independence of Catalonia and Die Spain"). He was also a member of the
Associació Nacionalista Catalana
[
ca
]
(Catalan Nationalist Association). He collaborated in the bulletin of the CADCI and formed part of the
Unió Catalanista
[
ca
]
(Catalanist Union). In 1915 he took part in the foundation of the Mossèn Cinto School, of which he was president that same year.
[4]
In 1918, after the end of the
First World War
, he was one of the promoters of the
Committee Pro Catalonia
, which aimed to get recognition for the effort of the Catalan Volunteers in the
First World War
in order to ask the
Society of Nations
for support for Catalan independence, following the postulates of the US president
Woodrow Wilson
, who defended the right to self-determination of peoples. It is in this committee that Vincent Albert Ballester created the
estelada
flag.
[5]
Ballester was a very active Catalan activist and in 1923 he was one of the participants (and later chronicler) of the September 11th demonstration that year, which was violently put down with sabre charges, just one day before the
coup d'état
of general
Primo of Rivera
.
[6]
Ballester backed the foreign campaign of
Francesc Macià
's
Catalan State
although he was critical with the planned invasion from
Prats de Molló
. Beginning in 1924 he was the last president of Unió Catalanista, which under his leadership became a political party and adopted a pro-independence ideology. Ballester collaborated with numerous Catalan magazines in the Americas, including
Ressorgiment
[
ca
]
(Revival) in Buenos Aires, and
La Nova Catalunya
(New Catalonia) in
Havana
, Cuba. Gravely ill, he died shortly before the
Francoist
occupation of Catalonia.
Legacy
[
edit
]
In August 2009, the town of Vic voted to name a square in his honor.
[7]
In January 2014 a square in the
Ciutat Vella
district of
Barcelona
was inaugurated with his name.
[8]
[9]
In mid-2014, the city of
Girona
paid homage to the estelada designer by lending his name to the Montilivi municipal gardens after having voted the resolution six years earlier during the centennial celebration of the Estelada.

German musical instrument builder
Johann Gottfried Moritz
(1777 - 23 July 1840) was a German musical instrument builder, best known as one of the inventors of the modern
tuba
.
Tuba by Wieprecht & Moritz as described in Prussian patent No.19.
Biography
[
edit
]
Moritz was born in
Berlin
in 1777.  From 1799 he apprenticed as an instrument builder in
Leipzig
, then in 1805 moved to
Dresden
. From 1808 he returned to Berlin and opened his own workshop. In 1819 he was appointed as instrument maker to the Prussian royal court, where he worked for most of his career.
[1]
Together with
Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht
, the director of the royal military music corps, Moritz was successful in greatly improving the valve system used on early brass instruments. These valves designed by Moritz and Wieprecht were known as “Berliner Pumpen”, and were more reliable than the previous models. Shortly after that, Moritz invented the "Bass tuba in F", the first modern
tuba
, which he patented in 1835. Wieprecht included the new tuba in military bands almost immediately, where its descendants remain used as the bass instrument in marching bands today. The oldest remaining original tuba from Johann Gottfried Moritz's workshop is today held in the Musikinstrumenten-Museum Berlin.
In 1835, Johann Gottfried retired from building instruments, with the manufacturing business being taken over by his son
Carl Wilhelm Moritz
.  Their sons and grandsons kept the business in family hands more or less continuously over the following century and a half, until economic issues following
World War 2
forced its closure in 1959.

His first major senior tournament came in 2007: although he had improved his best to 13.47 seconds that summer, he failed to progress beyond the heats at the
Osaka World Championships
. The following year he attended his first major indoor tournament, but did not get past the heats, recording a sub-par 7.97 seconds in the
60 metre hurdles
at the
2008 World Indoor Championships
. He qualified to represent his country at the
2008 Beijing Olympics
and reached the quarter-finals.
[3]
The 2009 season began with significant improvements for Sands. He registered a 60 m hurdles best of 7.49 seconds in the indoor season and set the national record in the 110 m hurdles at the 2009
Osaka Grand Prix
.
[3]
He was pleased with both the achievement and winning the race, which he had done despite hitting two of the hurdles.

During
World War II
,
Allied
forces conducted
air raids on Japan
from 1942 to 1945, causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During the first years of the
Pacific War
these attacks were limited to the
Doolittle Raid
in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the
Kuril Islands
from mid-1943.
Strategic bombing
raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based
tactical air units
also attacked Japan during 1945.
The
United States Army Air Forces
campaign against Japan began in earnest in mid-1944 and intensified during the war's last months. While plans for attacks on Japan had been prepared prior to the Pacific War, these could not begin until the long-range
Boeing B-29 Superfortress
bomber was ready for combat. From June 1944 until January 1945, B-29s stationed in India staged through bases in China to make a series of nine raids on targets in western Japan, but this effort proved ineffective. The strategic bombing campaign was greatly expanded from November 1944 when bases in the
Mariana Islands
became available as a result of the
Mariana Islands Campaign
. Initial attempts to target industrial facilities using high-altitude daylight "precision" bombing were largely ineffective. From February 1945, the bombers switched to low-altitude night
firebombing
against urban areas as much of the manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes: this approach resulted in large-scale urban damage and high civilian casualties. Aircraft flying from Allied
aircraft carriers
and the
Ryukyu Islands
also frequently struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for the
planned invasion of Japan
scheduled for October 1945. During early August 1945, the cities of
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
were
struck and mostly destroyed by atomic bombs
.
Japan's military and
civil defenses
were unable to stop the Allied attacks. The number of
fighter aircraft
and
anti-aircraft guns
assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, and most of these aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, and a lack of coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to
incendiary bombs
, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few
air raid shelters
were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.
The Allied bombing campaign was one of the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's
decision to surrender
in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is
particularly controversial
. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. Other estimates of total fatalities range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.
Background
[
edit
]
United States plans
[
edit
]
The
United States Army Air Corps
(which was subsumed by the
United States Army Air Forces
(USAAF) in February 1942)
[7]
began developing contingency plans for an air campaign against Japan during 1940. During that year the naval attaché to the
Embassy of the United States in Tokyo
reported that Japan's
civil defenses
were weak, and proposals were made for American aircrew to volunteer for service with Chinese forces in the
Second Sino-Japanese War
.
[8]
The first
American Volunteer Group
(the "
Flying Tigers
") began operations as part of the
Republic of China Air Force
(ROCAF) in late 1941 using
P-40 Warhawk
fighter aircraft. A second American Volunteer Group was also formed in late 1941 to attack Japan from bases in China using
Hudson
and
A-20 Havoc
medium bombers. The
attack on Pearl Harbor
on 7 December 1941 led to open hostilities between the US and Japan and ended the need for covert operations, however, and this unit did not become active. The small number of Second Air Volunteer Group personnel who were dispatched from the United States in November 1941 were diverted to Australia upon the outbreak of war.
[9]
[10]
Japanese successes during the opening months of the
Pacific War
nullified pre-war US plans for attacks against the Japanese homeland and a series of attempts to start a small-scale campaign from bases in China were unsuccessful. Before the outbreak of war, the USAAF had planned to bomb Japan from
Wake Island
,
Guam
, the
Philippines
and coastal areas in China.
[9]
However, these areas were rapidly captured by Japanese forces, and the USAAF heavy bomber force in the Philippines was largely destroyed when
Clark Air Base
was attacked on 8 December 1941.
[11]
The USAAF subsequently attempted to send thirteen heavy bombers to China in March and April 1942 to attack the
Japanese home islands
. These aircraft reached India, but remained there as the
Japanese conquest of Burma
caused logistics problems and Chinese Nationalist leader
Chiang Kai-shek
was reluctant to allow them to operate from territory under his control. A further 13
B-24 Liberator
heavy bombers were dispatched from the United States to operate from China in May 1942 as the
HALPRO
force, but were re-tasked to support Allied operations in the Mediterranean.
[12]
In July 1942, the commander of the American Volunteer Group, Colonel
Claire Lee Chennault
, sought a force of 100
P-47 Thunderbolt
fighters and 30
B-25 Mitchell
medium bombers, which he believed would be sufficient to "destroy" the Japanese aircraft industry. Three months later Chennault told United States President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
that a force of 105 modern fighters and 40 bombers (including twelve heavy bombers) would be able to "accomplish the downfall of Japan" within six to twelve months. The USAAF's headquarters did not regard these claims as credible, and Chennault's requests for reinforcements were not granted.
[12]
Pre-war Japanese defenses
[
edit
]
An
air-raid shelter
being built in Japan, September 1940
The Japanese government's pre-war plans to protect the country from air attack focused on neutralizing enemy air bases. Before the war it was believed that
Soviet
aircraft based in the
Russian Far East
posed the greatest threat. The Japanese military planned to destroy the air bases within range of the home islands if Japan and the Soviet Union ever went to war.
[13]
When the Pacific War began, the Japanese government believed that the best way to prevent American air raids was to capture and hold the areas in China and the Pacific from which such attacks could be launched. It was expected that the Allies would not be able to re-capture these bases. However, the Japanese anticipated that the Allies might still make small-scale attacks against the home islands using naval aircraft flying from
aircraft carriers
. The government chose not to develop strong defenses to meet the threat of air attack as the country's industrial resources were unable to maintain offensive air forces in China and the Pacific as well as a defensive force in the home islands.
[14]
Few air units or anti-aircraft batteries were stationed in the home islands during the early months of the Pacific War. The
General Defense Command
(GDC) had been formed in July 1941 to oversee the defense of the home islands, but all combat units in this area were assigned to the four regional military districts (the
Northern
,
Eastern
,
Central
and
Western
districts) which reported directly to the
Ministry of War
. As a result, the GDC's functions were limited to coordinating communications between the
Imperial General Headquarters
—Japan's highest military decision-making body—and the military districts.
[15]
In early 1942, forces allocated to the defense of Japan comprised 100
Imperial Japanese Army Air Force
(IJAAF) and 200
Imperial Japanese Navy
(IJN) fighter aircraft, many of which were obsolete, as well as 500 Army-manned and 200 IJN anti-aircraft guns.
[16]
Most of the IJAAF and IJN formations in the home islands were training units which had only a limited ability to counter Allied attacks.
[17]
The Army also operated a network of military and civilian observation posts to provide warning of air attack and was in the process of building
radar
stations. Command and control of the air defenses was fragmented, and the IJAAF and IJN did not coordinate their activities or communicate with each other. As a result, the forces were unable to react to a sudden air attack.
[16]
Japanese cities were highly vulnerable to damage from
firebombing
due to their design and the weak state of the country's civil defense organization. Urban areas were typically congested, and most buildings were constructed from highly flammable materials such as paper and wood. In addition, industrial and military facilities in urban areas were normally surrounded by densely populated residential buildings.
[18]
[19]
Despite this vulnerability, few cities had full-time professional
firefighters
and most relied on volunteers. Such firefighting forces that did exist lacked modern equipment and used outdated tactics.
[20]
Air raid drills had been held in Tokyo and Osaka since 1928, however, and from 1937 local governments were required to provide civilians with manuals that explained how to respond to air attacks.
[21]
Few
air-raid shelters
and other air defense facilities for civilians and industry were constructed prior to the Pacific War.

Chinese raid

The
Republic of China Air Force
(ROCAF) conducted a single attack on the Japanese home islands during the
Second Sino-Japanese War
. On 19 May 1938 two ROCAF
Martin B-10
bombers
dropped
propaganda
leaflets on
Nagasaki
,
Fukuoka
,
Kurume
,
Saga
, and other locations on
Kyushu
. These leaflets did not have any effect on Japanese civilians, but demonstrated that China could potentially conduct small scale air attacks on the area. The Japanese military later incorrectly concluded that the ROCAF had aircraft capable of mounting attacks at a range of 1,300 miles (2,100 km) from their bases, and took precautions against potential raids on western Japan when Chinese forces launched an offensive during 1939.

Doolittle Raid

Main article:
Doolittle Raid
USAAF aircraft bombed Japan for the first time in mid-April 1942. In an operation conducted primarily to raise morale in the United States and to avenge the
attack on Pearl Harbor
, 16 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers were carried from San Francisco to within range of Japan on the aircraft carrier
USS
Hornet
. These aircraft were launched on 18 April, and individually bombed targets in Tokyo,
Yokohama
,
Yokosuka
,
Nagoya
and
Kobe
. The Japanese air defense units were taken by surprise, and all the B-25s escaped without serious damage. The aircraft then continued to China and the Soviet Union, though several crashed in Japanese-held territory after running out of fuel.
[24]
Japanese casualties were 50 killed and over 400 wounded. About 200 houses were also destroyed.
[25]
Although the Doolittle Raid caused little damage, it had important ramifications. The attack raised morale in the United States and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel
James H. Doolittle
, was seen as a hero.
[26]
The weak state of the country's air defenses greatly embarrassed the Japanese military leadership, and four fighter
groups
were transferred from the Pacific to defend the home islands. In an attempt to prevent further naval raids, the IJN launched an offensive in the Pacific Ocean which ended in defeat during the
Battle of Midway
.
[27]
The Japanese Army also conducted the
Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign
to capture the airfields in central China at which the Doolittle Raiders had intended to land. This offensive achieved its objectives and resulted in the deaths of 250,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians; many of these civilian deaths were due to
war crimes
.
[28]
The destruction of the airfields and heavy casualties badly damaged China's war effort.
[29]
The IJA also began developing
fire balloons
capable of carrying incendiary and anti-personnel bombs from Japan to the continental United States.
[30]
Bombing of the Kuril Islands
[
edit
]
Following the Doolittle Raid, the next air attacks on Japan were made against the
Kuril Islands
in mid-1943. The liberation of Alaska's
Attu Island
in May 1943 during the
Aleutian Islands Campaign
provided the USAAF with bases within range of the Kurils. As part of the preparations for the liberation of
Kiska Island
in the Aleutians, the
Eleventh Air Force
conducted a series of raids against the Kurils to suppress the Japanese air units stationed there. The first of these attacks was made against southern
Shumshu
and northern
Paramushiru
by eight B-25s on 10 July. The Kurils were attacked again on 18 July by six B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, and the unopposed liberation of Kiska (
Operation Cottage
) took place on 15 August.
[31]
The Eleventh Air Force and US Navy units continued to make small-scale raids on the Kuril Islands until the closing months of the war. The USAAF attacks were broken off for five months following a raid on 11 September 1943 when nine of the 20 B-24s and B-25s dispatched were lost, but raids by US Navy
PBY Catalinas
continued. In response to the American attacks, the IJN established the North-East Area Fleet in August 1943, and in November that year Japanese fighter strength in the Kurils and
Hokkaidō
peaked at 260 aircraft. The Eleventh Air Force resumed its offensive in February 1944 after it had been reinforced with two
squadrons
of
P-38 Lightning
escort fighters, and it continued to attack targets in the Kurils until June 1945.
[32]
While these raids caused little damage, they caused the Japanese to divert large numbers of soldiers to defend their northern islands against a potential United States invasion.

Operation Matterhorn

Operation Matterhorn
Main article:
Operation Matterhorn
Preparations
[
edit
]
In late 1943, the United States
Joint Chiefs of Staff
approved a proposal to begin the
strategic air campaign
against the Japanese home islands and East Asia by basing
B-29 Superfortress
heavy bombers in India and establishing forward airfields in China. This strategy, designated
Operation Matterhorn
, involved the construction of large airstrips near
Chengdu
in inland China which would be used to refuel B-29s traveling from bases in
Bengal
en route to targets in Japan.
[34]
Chennault, by now the commander of the
Fourteenth Air Force
in China, advocated building the B-29 bases near
Kweilin
, closer to Japan, but this area was judged too vulnerable to counterattack.
[35]
However, the decision to build airstrips at Chengdu meant that
Kyūshū
was the only part of the home island chain within the B-29's 1,600-mile (2,600 km)
combat radius
.
[36]
Construction of the airfields began in January 1944, and the project involved around 300,000 conscripted Chinese labourers and 75,000 contracted workers.
[37]
XX Bomber Command
was assigned responsibility for Operation Matterhorn, and its ground crew began to leave the United States for India during December 1943.
[38]
[39]
The
Twentieth Air Force
was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, the commander of the USAAF, General
Henry H. Arnold
, took personal command of this unit and ran it from
the Pentagon
in Washington, D.C.
[40]
The
58th Bombardment Wing
was XX Bomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from
Kansas
to India took place between April and mid-May 1944.
[41]
The Japanese military began transferring fighter aircraft to the home islands from China and the Pacific in early 1944 in anticipation of B-29 raids. Japanese
intelligence
detected the construction of B-29 bases in India and China, and the military began to develop plans to counter air raids originating from China.
[42]
The three IJAAF air brigades stationed in
Honshū
and Kyūshū were expanded to air divisions between March and June (these were designated the
10th
,
11th
and
12th Air Divisions
). By late June the air defense units in the home islands were assigned 260 fighters, and could draw on approximately 500 additional aircraft during emergencies.
[43]
[44]
[45]
Additional anti-aircraft gun batteries and searchlight units were also established to protect major cities and military bases.
[44]
The GDC's authority was strengthened when the army units in the Eastern, Central and Western military districts were placed under its command in May.
[46]
The IJN defensive fighter units stationed at
Kure
,
Sasebo
and Yokosuka were also assigned to the GDC in July, but cooperation between the GDC's Army units and the much smaller number of naval units was poor.
[45]
[47]
[48]
Despite these improvements, Japan's air defenses remained inadequate as few aircraft and anti-aircraft guns could effectively engage B-29s at their cruising altitude of 30,000 feet (9,100 m) and the number of radar stations capable of providing early warning of raids was insufficient.
[49]
Civilians participating in an air-raid drill during 1942
The Japanese government also sought to improve the country's civil defenses in response to the Doolittle Raid and the threat of further attacks. The national government placed the burden of constructing civilian air-raid shelters on the
prefectural governments
. However, few shelters were built due to shortages of concrete and steel. In October 1943 the
Home Ministry
directed households in the major cities to build their own shelters, though these were normally only
trenches
.
[22]
A small number of sophisticated shelters were constructed for air defense headquarters and to protect key telephone facilities. However, less than two percent of civilians had access to bombproof air-raid shelters, though tunnels and natural caves were also used to protect civilians from B-29 raids.
[50]
Following the outbreak of war, the Home Ministry expanded the number of firefighters, though these generally remained volunteers who lacked adequate training and equipment.
[51]
Civilians were also trained to fight fires and encouraged to swear an "air defense oath" to respond to attacks from incendiary or high explosive bombs.
[52]
From autumn 1943 the Japanese government took further steps to prepare the country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create
firebreaks
began the next month. By the end of the war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people.
[53]
The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to
move to the countryside
from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family.
[52]
Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.
[54]
Attacks from China
[
edit
]
XX Bomber Command began flying missions against Japan in mid-June 1944. The first raid took place on the night of 15/16 June when 75 B-29s were dispatched to
attack the Imperial Iron and Steel Works
at
Yawata
in northern Kyūshū. This attack caused little damage and cost seven B-29s, but received enthusiastic media coverage in the United States and indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well.
[55]
[56]
The Japanese military began expanding the fighter force in the home islands after the attack on Yawata, and by October, 375 aircraft were assigned to the three air defense air divisions. These divisions remained at about this strength until March 1945.
[45]
Arnold relieved XX Bomber Command's commander, Brigadier General Kenneth Wolfe, shortly after the raid on Yawata when he was unable to make follow-up attacks on Japan due to insufficient fuel stockpiles at the bases in China. Wolfe's replacement was Major General
Curtis LeMay
, a veteran of
Eighth Air Force
bombing attacks against Germany.
[57]
B-29s about to raid
Yawata on 15 June 1944
Subsequent B-29 raids staging through China generally did not meet their objectives. The second raid took place on 7 July when 17 B-29s attacked Sasebo,
Ōmura
and
Tobata
, causing little damage, and on the night of 10/11 August 24 Superfortresses attacked
Nagasaki
. Another unsuccessful raid was conducted against Yawata on 20 August in which the B-29 force was intercepted by over 100 fighters. Twelve of the sixty-one Superfortresses that reached the target area were shot down, including one which was destroyed in a suicide
ramming
attack.
[58]
Japanese government propaganda
claimed that 100 bombers had been downed during this attack, and one of the crashed B-29s was placed on display in Tokyo.
[59]
XX Bomber Command's performance improved after LeMay instituted a training program and improved the organization of the B-29 maintenance units during August and September. A raid against Ōmura on 25 October destroyed the city's small aircraft factory, though a follow-up raid on 11 November ended in failure. The city was attacked again by 61 B-29s on 21 November and by 17 bombers on 19 December. XX Bomber Command made its ninth and final raid on Japan on 6 January 1945 when 28 B-29s once again struck Ōmura. During the same period the command conducted a number of attacks on targets in
Manchuria
, China and
Formosa
from its bases in China, as well as striking targets in Southeast Asia from India. The command flew its final mission from India, a
raid on Singapore
, on 29 March; its constituent units were then transferred to the Mariana Islands.
[60]
Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids conducted against Japan via bases in China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XX Bomber Command lost 125 B-29s during all of its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; the majority of the losses were due to flying accidents.
[61]
[62]
The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses at the expense of other areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XX Bomber Command's efforts may have prevented the Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting adequate supplies to India and China was the most important factor behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign.
[63]
The adverse weather conditions common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.
[36]
Proposed Soviet-American cooperation
[
edit
]
In 1944 bombing of Japan from the Soviet Union by American aircraft with American or Soviet crews was considered. Following a request from Roosevelt at the
Tehran Conference
, Stalin agreed on 2 February 1944 that the United States could operate 1,000 bombers from Siberia after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan.
[64]
In spring 1944, the Soviets asked for assistance in creating a long-range bombing force for Japan, with 300 (lend-lease) B-24s and 240 B-29s. In negotiations in July and August, the United States agreed to supply 200 B-24s (50 per month; probably via Abadan) and to train operational and maintenance crews. But with difficulties over the arrangements, the USSR announced on 29 September that they would forego American training in view of the uncertainty over the B-24s.
[65]
Stalin had agreed at the 1944
Moscow Conference
to the United States having air bases near
Vladivostok
(where six or seven large aerodromes had been built and reserved
[65]
) and the use of
Petropavlovsk
(
Kamchatka
) as a base; he "virtually ignored" earlier proposals for a Soviet bombing force. However, despite an American team going to Moscow in December 1944 they failed to reach agreement. On 16 December 1944 General
Antonov
said that Soviet forces would need all their naval and air bases in the Maritime Provinces' and American B-29s would have to be based far to the north of
Vladivostok
near the mouth of the
Amur River
in the Komsomolsk-Nikolaevsk area. It was decided to press for this at Yalta. At the
Yalta Conference
one year later, Stalin told Roosevelt that American B-29s would be based at the remote Komsomolsk-Nikolaevsk area. Antonov said that they would start preliminary base construction. However, the proposal subsequently lapsed.
[66]
Initial attacks from the Mariana Islands
[
edit
]
During the
Mariana Islands campaign
, US forces captured Japanese-held islands in the Battles of
Guam
,
Saipan
and
Tinian
between June and August 1944.
[67]
USAAF and US Navy engineers subsequently constructed six airfields on the islands to accommodate hundreds of B-29s.
[68]
These bases were more capable of supporting an intensive air campaign against Japan than those in China as they could be easily supplied by sea and were 1,500 miles (2,400 km) south of Tokyo, which allowed B-29s to strike most areas in the home islands and return without refueling.
[1]
Japanese aircraft made several attacks
on the airfield at Saipan while it was under construction.
[69]
Brigadier General
Haywood S. Hansell
posing with a map of the Tokyo region in November 1944
The Twentieth Air Force's
XXI Bomber Command
began arriving in the Mariana Islands during October 1944. The Command was led by Brigadier General
Haywood S. Hansell
, who had also participated in Eighth Air Force operations against Germany. XXI Bomber Command B-29s flew six practice missions against targets in the Central Pacific during October and November in preparation for their first attack on Japan.
[70]
On 1 November, an F-13 photo reconnaissance variant of the B-29 from the
3rd Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron
overflew Tokyo
; this was the first American aircraft to fly over the city since the Doolittle Raid. Further F-13 sorties were conducted during early November to gather intelligence on aircraft factories and port facilities in the Tokyo-Yokosuka area. The F-13s were generally able to evade the heavy anti-aircraft fire they attracted and the large numbers of Japanese fighters that were scrambled to intercept them as they flew at both high speed and high altitude.
[71]
XXI Bomber Command's initial attacks against Japan were focused on the country's aircraft industry.
[72]
The first attack, codenamed
Operation San Antonio I
, was made against the Musashino aircraft plant in the outskirts of Tokyo on 24 November 1944. Only 24 of the 111 B-29s dispatched attacked the primary target, and the others bombed port facilities as well as industrial and urban areas. The Americans were intercepted by 125 Japanese fighters but only one B-29 was shot down.
[1]
This attack caused some damage to the aircraft plant and further reduced Japanese civilians' confidence in the country's air defenses.
[73]
In response, the IJAAF and IJN stepped up their air attacks on B-29 bases in the Mariana Islands from 27 November; these raids continued until January 1945 and resulted in the destruction of 11 Superfortresses and damage to another 43 for the loss of probably 37 Japanese aircraft.
[74]
The IJA also began launching
Fu-Go balloon bombs
against the United States during November. This campaign caused little damage and was abandoned in March 1945. By this time 9,000 balloons had been dispatched but only 285 were reported to have reached the
contiguous United States
.
[75]
The next American raids on Japan were not successful. XXI Bomber Command attacked Tokyo three times between 27 November and 3 December; two of these raids were made against the Musashino aircraft plant while the other targeted an industrial area using
M-69 incendiary cluster bombs
, specifically developed to damage Japanese urban areas.
[76]
The aircraft plant was attacked on 27 November and 3 December and was only lightly damaged as high winds and clouds prevented accurate bombing. The incendiary raid conducted on the night of 29/30 November by 29 Superfortresses burnt out one tenth of a square mile, and was also judged to be unsuccessful by the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters.
[77]
A B-29 falls in flames after a direct hit by an
anti-aircraft shell
over Japan
Four of XXI Bomber Command's next five raids were
made against targets in Nagoya
. The first two of these attacks on 13 and 18 December used precision bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants.
[78]
The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test the effectiveness of these weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting to produce results and moving to
area bombardment
would be counterproductive, but agreed to the operation after he was assured that it did not represent a general shift in tactics.
[79]
Despite the change in armament, the 22 December raid was planned as a precision attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused.
[80]
XXI Bomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27 December, but did not damage the facility. On 3 January 1945, 97 B-29s were dispatched to conduct an area bombing raid on Nagoya. This attack started several fires, but these were quickly brought under control.
[81]
Arnold was disappointed with what XXI Bomber Command had achieved, and wanted the Command to produce results quickly. In addition, Hansell's preference for precision bombing was no longer in accordance with the views of the Twentieth Air Force headquarters, which wanted a greater emphasis on area attacks. In late December 1944 Arnold decided to relieve Hansell of his command. Seeing LeMay's success in improving XX Bomber Command's performance, Arnold thought LeMay could solve the problems at XXI Bomber Command, and replaced Hansell with him. Hansell was informed of Arnold's decision on 6 January, but remained in his position until mid-January.
[82]
During this period, XXI Bomber Command conducted unsuccessful precision bombing attacks on the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo and a Mitsubishi Aircraft Works factory in Nagoya on 9 and 14 January respectively. The last attack planned by Hansell was more successful, however: a force of 77 B-29s crippled a
Kawasaki Aircraft Industries
factory near
Akashi
on 19 January.
[83]
During XXI Bomber Command's first three months of operations, it lost an average of 4.1% of aircraft dispatched in each raid.
[84]
In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly adopted a civil defense plan to counter the American air raids. This plan assigned responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a
blackout
from 10:00 pm. Japanese positions in the
Bonin Islands
were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and
air raid sirens
were sounded in cities threatened by attack.
[85]
The first attacks conducted under LeMay's leadership achieved mixed results. XXI Bomber Command flew six major missions between 23 January and 19 February with little success, though an incendiary raid
against Kobe
on 4 February caused significant damage to the city and its main factories.
[86]
Moreover, while improved maintenance procedures implemented by LeMay reduced the number of B-29s that had to return to base during raids due to technical problems, the Command suffered a loss rate of 5.1% in these operations.
[87]
From 19 February to 3 March, XXI Bomber Command conducted a series of precision bombing raids on aircraft factories that sought to tie down Japanese air units so they could not participate in the
Battle of Iwo Jima
. However, these attacks were frustrated by high winds and cloud cover and little damage was inflicted. A firebombing raid conducted against Tokyo by 172 B-29s on 25 February was considered successful as it burnt or damaged approximately one square mile of the city's urban area.
[88]
This attack was a large-scale test of the effectiveness of firebombing.
[89]
Several factors explain the poor results of XXI Bomber Command's precision bombing campaign. The most important of these was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces often had to pass through severe
weather fronts
between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXI Bomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 maintenance practices and over-crowding at its airfields—these factors reduced the number of aircraft which were available for operations and complicated the process of launching and recovering the bombers.
[90]
By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the high costs of the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.
[91]
Firebombing attacks
[
edit
]
LeMay changes tactics
[
edit
]
USAAF planners began assessing the feasibility of a firebombing campaign against Japanese cities in 1943. Japan's main industrial facilities were vulnerable to such attacks as they were concentrated in several large cities and a high proportion of production took place in homes and small factories in urban areas. The planners estimated that incendiary bomb attacks on Japan's six largest cities could cause physical damage to almost 40 percent of industrial facilities and result in the loss of 7.6 million man-months of labor. It was also estimated that these attacks would kill over 500,000 people, render about 7.75 million homeless and force almost 3.5 million to be evacuated.
[92]
[93]
In 1943 the USAAF tested the effectiveness of incendiary bombs on Japanese-style buildings at
Eglin Field
and the "
Japanese Village
" at
Dugway Proving Ground
.
[94]
The American military also attempted to develop "
bat bombs
", using incendiary bombs attached to bats dropped by aircraft to attack Japanese cities, but this project was abandoned in 1944.
[95]
During early 1945 the USAAF conducted raids against cities in
Formosa
to trial tactics which could be later used against Japanese urban areas.
[96]
Napalm
, used by the Americans for
flamethrowers
and incendiary bombs, was increased in production from 500,000 lb (230,000 kg) in 1943 to 8 million lb (3.6 kt) in 1944. Much of the napalm went from nine US factories to bomb-assembly plants making the M-69 incendiary and packing 38 of them into the E-46 cluster bomb; these were shipped across the Pacific and stored for future use.
[97]
Arnold and the Air Staff wanted to wait to use the incendiaries until a large-scale program of firebombing could be mounted, to overwhelm the Japanese city defenses.
[98]
In light of the poor results of the precision bombing campaign and the success of the 25 February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945.
[98]
[99]
This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXI Bomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign.
[100]
LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General
Lauris Norstad
, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support.
[101]
The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.
[102]
To maximize the effectiveness of the firebombing attacks, LeMay ordered the B-29s to fly at the low altitude of 5,000 feet (1,500 m) and bomb by night; this represented a significant change from the Command's standard tactics, which focused on high-altitude daylight bombing. As Japan's
night fighter
force was weak and the anti-aircraft batteries were less effective at night, LeMay also had most of the B-29s' defensive guns removed; by reducing the weight of the aircraft in this way they were able to carry more bombs.
[89]
These changes were not popular with XXI Bomber Command's aircrew, as they believed that it was safer to fly heavily armed aircraft at high altitude.
[103]
March firebombing campaign
[
edit
]
The partially incinerated remains of Japanese civilians in Tokyo, 10 March 1945
Bodies of people killed in Operation Meetinghouse laid out in Ueno Park, Tokyo, 16 March 1945
The first firebombing attack in this campaign—codenamed
Operation Meetinghouse
—was carried out against Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March, and proved to be the single most destructive air raid of the war.
[104]
XXI Bomber Command mounted a maximum effort, and on the afternoon of 9 March 346 B-29s left the Marianas bound for Tokyo. They began to arrive over the city at 2:00 am Guam time on 10 March, and 279 bombers dropped 1,665 tons of bombs.
[105]
The raid caused a massive
conflagration
that overwhelmed Tokyo's civil defenses and destroyed 16 square miles (41 km
2
) of buildings, representing seven percent of the city's urban area.
[106]
The Tokyo police force and fire department estimated that 83,793 people were killed during the air raid, another 40,918 were injured and just over a million lost their homes; postwar estimates of deaths in this attack have ranged from 80,000 to 100,000.
[107]
[108]
Damage to Tokyo's war production was also substantial.
[107]
Japanese opposition to this attack was relatively weak; 14 B-29s were destroyed as a result of combat or mechanical faults and a further 42 damaged by anti-aircraft fire.
[109]
Following the attack on Tokyo, the Japanese government ordered the evacuation of all schoolchildren in the third to sixth grades from the main cities, and 87 percent of them had departed to the countryside by early April.
[52]
XXI Bomber Command followed up the firebombing of Tokyo with similar raids against other major cities. On 11 March 310 B-29s were dispatched against Nagoya. The bombing was spread over a greater area than had been the case at Tokyo, and the attack caused less damage. Nevertheless, 2.05 square miles (5.3 km
2
) of buildings were burnt out and no B-29s were lost to the Japanese defenses. On the night of 13/14 March, 274 Superfortresses
attacked Osaka
and destroyed 8.1 square miles (21 km
2
) of the city for the loss of two aircraft. Kobe was the next target in the firebombing campaign, and was attacked by 331 B-29s on the night of 16/17 March. The resulting
firestorm
destroyed 7 square miles (18 km
2
) of the city (equivalent to half its area), killed 8,000 people and rendered 650,000 homeless. Three B-29s were lost. Nagoya was attacked again on the night of 18/19 March, and the B-29s destroyed 2.95 square miles (7.6 km
2
) of buildings. Only one Superfortress was shot down during this attack, and all members of its crew were rescued after the aircraft ditched into the sea. This raid marked the end of the first firebombing campaign as XXI Bomber Command had exhausted its supplies of incendiary bombs.
[110]
[111]
The Command's next major operation was an unsuccessful night precision attack on the Mitsubishi aircraft engine factory conducted on the night of 23/24 March; during this operation five of the 251 aircraft dispatched were shot down.
[112]
B-29s also began to drop propaganda leaflets over Japan during March. These leaflets called on Japanese civilians to overthrow their government or face destruction.
[113]
The USAAF assessed that the firebombing campaign had been highly successful, and noted that American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for the air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would be sufficient to force the country's surrender.
[114]
[115]
The Japanese government was concerned about the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed.
[116]
Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.
[117]
Destruction of Japan's main cities
[

The areas of Japan's main cities which were destroyed in air attacks during World War II
The start of the major firebombing campaign was delayed as XXI Bomber Command was used to attack airfields in southern Japan from late March to mid-May in support of the
invasion of Okinawa
, an island only a few hundred miles south of the home islands. Prior to the landings on 1 April, the Command bombed airfields in Kyushu at
Ōita
and
Tachiarai
as well as an aircraft plant at Ōmura on 27 March, and struck Ōita and Tachiarai again on the 31st of the month. No B-29s were lost in these raids.
[118]
From 6 April the Japanese conducted large-scale
kamikaze
air raids on the Allied invasion fleet, during which suicide aircraft damaged or sank many warships and transports. As part of the Allied response to these attacks, XXI Bomber Command conducted major raids on airfields in Kyushu on 8 and 16 April, though the first of these attacks was diverted to strike residential areas in
Kagoshima
after the airfields were found to be covered by clouds. From 17 April until 11 May, when the B-29s were released for other duties, about three-quarters of XXI Bomber Command's effort was devoted to attacking airfields and other targets in direct support of the Battle of Okinawa; this included 2,104 sorties flown against 17 airfields. These raids cost the Command 24 B-29s destroyed and 233 damaged and failed to completely suppress kamikaze attacks from the targeted airfields.
[119]
[120]

A few attacks on Japanese cities were conducted during the Battle of Okinawa. On 1 April, a night precision bombing raid was flown against the Nakajima engine factory in Tokyo by 121 B-29s and three similar attacks were conducted against engine factories in
Shizuoka
, Koizumi and
Tachikawa
on the night of 3 April. These raids were unsuccessful as XXI Bomber Command lacked the specialized equipment needed to strike targets accurately at night, and LeMay decided not to conduct similar operations.
[121]
Small forces of B-29s also struck Tokyo and nearby
Kawasaki
on 4 April. Two successful large-scale precision bombing raids were flown against aircraft factories in Tokyo and Nagoya on 7 April; the raid on Tokyo was the first to be escorted by Iwo Jima-based
P-51 Mustang
very-long-range fighters from the
VII Fighter Command
, and the Americans claimed to have shot down 101 Japanese aircraft for the loss of two P-51s and seven B-29s.
[122]
[123]
Over 250 B-29s struck three different aircraft factories on 12 April; during this operation the
73rd Bombardment Wing
inflicted heavy damage on the Musashino aircraft plant and fought off 185 Japanese fighters without loss.
[124]
[125]
[126]
LeMay resumed night firebombing raids on 13 April when 327 B-29s attacked the arsenal district of Tokyo and destroyed 11.4 square miles (30 km
2
) of the city, including several armaments factories. On 15 April 303 Superfortresses attacked the Tokyo region and destroyed 6 square miles (16 km
2
) of Tokyo, 3.6 square miles (9.3 km
2
) of Kawasaki and 1.5 square miles (3.9 km
2
) of Yokohama for the loss of 12 bombers.
[123]
[127]
On 24 April the Tachikawa aircraft engine factory at Yamato near Tokyo was destroyed by 131 B-29s. An attack on the aircraft arsenal at Tachikawa six days later was aborted due to cloud cover; some of the heavy bombers attacked the city of
Hamamatsu
instead. Another precision raid was made against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory at Kure on 5 May when 148 B-29s inflicted heavy damage on the facility.
[128]
Five days later B-29s successfully attacked oil storage facilities at
Iwakuni
, Ōshima and
Toyama
.
[129]
On 11 May a small force of B-29s destroyed an airframe factory at Konan.
[128]
XXI Bomber Command reached its full strength in April when the 58th and
315th Bombardment Wings
arrived in the Marianas; at this time the command comprised five
wings
equipped with a total of 1,002 B-29s and was the most powerful air unit in the world.
[130]
[131]

After being released from supporting the Okinawa campaign, XXI Bomber Command conducted an intensive firebombing campaign against Japan's main cities from mid-May. A force of 472 B-29s struck Nagoya by day on 13 May and destroyed 3.15 square miles (8.2 km
2
) of the city. The Japanese mounted a strong defense that downed two Superfortresses and damaged another 64; another eight B-29s were lost to other causes. The Americans claimed 18 Japanese fighter "kills" as well as another 30 "probables" and 16 damaged. Nagoya was attacked again by 457 B-29s on the night of 16 May, and the resulting fires destroyed 3.82 square miles (9.9 km
2
) of the city. Japanese defenses were much weaker by night, and the three bombers lost in this attack crashed due to mechanical problems. The two raids on Nagoya killed 3,866 Japanese and rendered another 472,701 homeless.
[132]
On 19 May 318 B-29s conducted an unsuccessful precision bombing raid on the
Tachikawa Aircraft Company
.
[133]
XXI Bomber Command made further large-scale firebombing attacks against Tokyo on the nights of 23 and 25 May. In the first of these raids 520 B-29s destroyed 5.3 square miles (14 km
2
) of southern Tokyo with 17 aircraft lost and 69 damaged.
[134]
The second attack involved 502 B-29s and destroyed 16.8 square miles (44 km
2
) of the city's central area, including the headquarters of several key government ministries and much of the
Tokyo Imperial Palace
; the bomber crews had been briefed to not target the palace as the US Government did not want to risk killing Emperor
Hirohito
. The Japanese defenses were relatively successful on this occasion, and 26 Superfortresses were shot down and another 100 damaged.
[135]
[136]
A B-29 over Osaka on 1 June 1945
By the end of these raids just over half (50.8 percent) of Tokyo had been destroyed and the city was removed from XXI Bomber Command's target list.
[137]
The Command's last major raid of May was a daylight incendiary attack on Yokohama on 29 May conducted by 517 B-29s escorted by 101 P-51s. This force was intercepted by 150
A6M Zero
fighters, sparking an intense air battle in which five B-29s were shot down and another 175 damaged. In return, the P-51 pilots claimed 26 "kills" and 23 "probables" for the loss of three fighters. The 454 B-29s that reached Yokohama struck the city's main business district and destroyed 6.9 square miles (18 km
2
) of buildings; over 1000 Japanese were killed.
[138]
[139]
Overall, the attacks in May destroyed 94 square miles (240 km
2
) of buildings, which was equivalent to one seventh of Japan's total urban area. The
Minister of Home Affairs
,
Iwao Yamazaki
, concluded after these raids that Japan's civil defense arrangements were "considered to be futile".
[140]
Incendiary bombs being dropped on Kobe, 4 June 1945
The firebombing campaign against major cities ended in June. On the first day of the month 521 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were dispatched in a daylight raid against Osaka. While en route to the city the Mustangs flew through thick clouds, and 27 of the fighters were destroyed in collisions. Nevertheless, 458 heavy bombers and 27 P-51s reached the city and the bombardment killed 3,960 Japanese and destroyed 3.15 square miles (8.2 km
2
) of buildings. On 5 June 473 B-29s struck Kobe by day and destroyed 4.35 square miles (11.3 km
2
) of buildings for the loss of 11 bombers. A force of 409 B-29s attacked Osaka again on 7 June; during this attack 2.21 square miles (5.7 km
2
) of buildings were burnt out and the Americans did not suffer any losses. Osaka was bombed for the fourth time in the month on 15 June when 444 B-29s destroyed 1.9 square miles (4.9 km
2
) of the city and another 0.59 square miles (1.5 km
2
) of nearby
Amagasaki
; 300,000 houses were destroyed in Osaka.
[141]
[142]
This attack marked the end of the first phase of XXI Bomber Command's attack on Japan's cities. During May and June the bombers had destroyed much of the country's six largest cities, killing between 112,000 and 126,762 people and rendering millions homeless. The widespread destruction and high number of casualties from these raids caused many Japanese to realize that their country's military was no longer able to defend the home islands. American losses were low compared to Japanese casualties; 136 B-29s were downed during the campaign.
[143]
[144]
[145]
In Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kobe, and Kawasaki, "over 126,762 people were killed ... and a million and a half dwellings and over 105 square miles (270 km
2
) of urban space were destroyed."
[146]
In Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, "the areas leveled (almost 100 square miles (260 km
2
)) exceeded the areas
destroyed
in all
German
cities by both the
American
and
British air forces
(approximately 79 square miles (200 km
2
))."
[146]
Attacks on small cities
[
edit
]
Japanese cities attacked by B-29 bombers during World War II
In mid-June Arnold visited LeMay's headquarters at Saipan. During this visit he approved a proposal for XXI Bomber Command to attack 25 relatively small cities with populations ranging from 62,280 to 323,000 while also continuing precision raids on major targets. This decision was made despite a recommendation from the
United States Strategic Bombing Survey
(USSBS) team, which was assessing the effectiveness of air attacks on Germany, that operations against Japan should focus on the country's transportation network and other targets with the goal of crippling the movement of goods and destroying food supplies.
[147]
LeMay's plan called for precision attacks on important industrial targets on days when the weather over Japan was clear and incendiary attacks guided by radar on overcast days. As both the cities and industrial facilities targeted were relatively small, the B-29 force would be sent against multiple locations on days in which attacks were conducted. This targeting policy, which was labeled the "Empire Plan", remained in force until the last days of the war.
[148]
Five major precision bombing attacks were conducted as part of the Empire Plan. On 9 June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at
Narao
and another two groups raided a factory in
Atsuta
; both facilities were badly damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXI Bomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region.
[149]
Precision bombing raids were also conducted on 22 June, when 382 B-29s attacked six targets at Kure,
Kakamigahara
,
Himeji
, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of the factories targeted were badly damaged.
[150]
Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked targets of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended targets.
[151]
Cloudy weather prevented any further large-scale precision attacks until 24 July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of the factories attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed cloudy weather prevented any further Empire Plan precision attacks in the last weeks of the war.
[151]
Part of Shizuoka after
it was firebombed
on 19 June 1945
XXI Bomber Command began incendiary raids against small cities from 17 June. On that night, Hamamatsu, Kagoshima,
Ōmuta
,
Yokkaichi
were each attacked by a wing of B-29s using similar tactics to those employed in the firebombing raids against the major cities. Of the 477 B-29s dispatched, 456 struck their targets and Hamamatsu, Kagoshima, Yokkaichi suffered extensive damage; overall 6.073 square miles (15.73 km
2
) of buildings were destroyed. The cities were almost undefended and no B-29s were lost to Japanese actions.
[152]
[153]
This operation was judged a success, and set the pattern for XXI Bomber Command's firebombing attacks until the end of the war. As the campaign continued and the most important cities were destroyed, the bombers were sent against smaller and less significant cities. On most nights that raids were conducted, four cities were attacked, each by a wing of bombers. Two-wing operations were conducted against
Fukuoka
on 19 June and Ōmuta on 26 July, however. Sixteen multi-city incendiary attacks had been conducted by the end of the war (an average of two per week), and these targeted 58 cities. The incendiary raids were coordinated with precision bombing attacks during the last weeks of the war in an attempt to force the Japanese government to surrender.
[154]
As the small cities were not defended by anti-aircraft guns and Japan's night-fighter force was ineffective, only a single B-29 was shot down during this campaign; a further 66 were damaged and 18 crashed as a result of accidents.
[155]
Part of Sendai after the raid on 19 July 1945
The firebombing campaign against small cities continued through June and July. On the night of 19 June B-29s struck Fukuoka,
Shizuoka
and
Toyohashi
. On 28 June
Moji
,
Nobeoka
,
Okayama
and
Sasebo
were attacked.
Kumamoto
, Kure,
Shimonoseki
and
Ube
were bombed on 1 July. Two nights later,
Himeji
,
Kōchi
,
Takamatsu
and
Tokushima
were attacked. On 6 July, attacks were conducted against Akashi,
Chiba
,
Kōfu
and
Shimizu
.
Gifu
,
Sakai
,
Sendai
and
Wakayama
were struck on 9 July. Three nights later, the B-29s targeted
Ichinomiya
,
Tsuruga
,
Utsunomiya
and
Uwajima
. On 16 July,
Hiratsuka
,
Kuwana
,
Namazu
and
Ōita
were attacked.
Chōshi
,
Fukui
,
Hitachi
,
Okazaki
were bombed on 19 July. After a break of almost a week,
Matsuyama
, Omuta and
Tokuyama
were firebombed on 26 July.
[156]

XXI Bomber Command also conducted an intensive propaganda campaign alongside its firebombing raids. It has been estimated that B-29s dropped 10 million propaganda leaflets in May, 20 million in June and 30 million in July. The Japanese government implemented harsh penalties against civilians who kept copies of these leaflets.
[157]
On the night of 27/28 July, six B-29s dropped leaflets over 11 Japanese cities warning that they would be attacked in the future; this was intended to lower the morale of Japanese civilians and convince them that the United States was seeking to minimize civilian casualties.
[158]
As these cities were very weakly defended, the warnings did not increase the risks facing the American bomber forces.
[159]
Six of the cities (
Aomori
, Ichinomiya,
Tsu
,
Uji-Yamada
Ōgaki
and Uwajima) were attacked on 28 July. No B-29s were lost in the raids on these cities, though six were damaged by attacks from between 40 and 50 fighters and another five were hit by anti-aircraft fire.
[155]
Toyama burns after a B-29 air raid, 1 August 1945
August 1945 began with further large-scale raids against Japanese cities. On the 1st of the month, 836 B-29s staged the largest single raid of World War II, dropping 6,145 tons of bombs and mines. The cities of
Hachiōji
,
Mito
,
Nagaoka
and
Toyama
were the main targets of this operation; all four suffered extensive damage and 99.5 percent of buildings in Toyama were destroyed.
[160]
[161]
The cities of
Imabari
,
Maebashi
,
Nishinomiya
and
Saga
were attacked on 5 August.
[161]
These raids had also been preceded by propaganda leaflets and radio broadcasts from Saipan warning that the cities would be attacked.
[155]
From late June the 315th Bombardment Wing conducted a series of night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced
AN/APQ-7
radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube Oil Refinery at Yokkaichi on the night of 26 June.
[162]
The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck the refinery destroyed or damaged 30 percent of the facility.
[163]
The unit's next attack was against a refinery at
Kudamatsu
three nights later, and on the night of 2 July it struck another refinery at
Minoshima
.
[164]
On the night of 6/7 July the 315th Bombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil refinery near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery.
[163]
The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities by the end of the war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan had almost no crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.
[165]
During mid-July the USAAF strategic bomber forces in the Pacific were reorganized. On 16 July, XXI Bomber Command was re-designated the Twentieth Air Force and LeMay appointed its commander. Two days later the
United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific
(USASTAF) was established at Guam under the command of General
Carl Spaatz
. USASTAF's role was to command the Twentieth Air Force as well as the
Eighth Air Force
, which at the time was moving from Europe to Okinawa. The Eighth Air Force was led by James Doolittle (who had been promoted to general) and was being reequipped with B-29s. The Commonwealth
Tiger Force
, which was to include Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand heavy bomber squadrons and attack Japan from Okinawa, was also to come under the command of USASTAF when it arrived in the region during late 1945.

Aerial mine laying
[
edit
]
A map showing the areas of Japanese and Korean waters mined by the Twentieth Air Force up to 31 July 1945
From mid-1944, the US Navy pressed for B-29s to be used to lay
naval mines
in Japan's home waters to strengthen the blockade of the country. Arnold and his staff were unenthusiastic about these proposals, however, as they believed that such missions would divert too many Superfortresses away from precision bombing attacks. In response to repeated requests from the Navy, Arnold decided in November 1944 to begin mine-laying operations once sufficient aircraft were available. In January 1945, LeMay selected the
313th Bombardment Wing
to be the Twentieth Air Force's specialist mine-laying unit, and the Navy provided assistance with its training and logistics. LeMay designated the aerial mining campaign
Operation Starvation
.
[167]
As the United States had only occasionally used mines up to this time, the Japanese military had placed relatively little emphasis on keeping its
minesweeping
force up to date. As a result, the IJN was unprepared for the large-scale USAAF offensive.
[168]
The 313th Bombardment Wing conducted its first mine-laying operation on the night of 27/28 March when it mined the
Shimonoseki Strait
to prevent Japanese warships from using this route to attack the US landing force off Okinawa.
[118]
Mine-laying operations were disrupted in April as the wing was assigned to support operations in Okinawa and participate in conventional bombing raids. Its rate of effort increased in May, when it conducted missions against harbors and other choke points around Honshu and Kyushu. The air-dropped minefields greatly disrupted Japanese coastal shipping.
[169]
LeMay increased the number of mine-laying sorties in June, and the
505th Bombardment Group
joined the 313th Bombardment Wing on occasion. In response to this offensive, the Japanese greatly expanded their mine-sweeping force by 349 ships and 20,000 men and deployed additional anti-aircraft guns around the Shimonoseki Strait. They had little success in permanently clearing minefields or downing the B-29s, however. Many of Japan's major harbors, including those of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya, became permanently closed to shipping. During the last weeks of the war, B-29s continued to drop large numbers of mines off Japan and the campaign was expanded into Korean waters. The 313th Bombardment Wing lost only 16 B-29s during mine-laying operations.
[170]
Overall, mines dropped by Superfortresses off the home islands sank 293 ships, which represented 9.3 percent of all Japanese merchant shipping destroyed during the Pacific War and 60 percent of losses between April and August 1945. Following the war, the USSBS assessed that the Twentieth Air Force should have placed a greater emphasis on attacking Japanese shipping given the effectiveness of these attacks.
[168]
[171]
Naval air attacks
[
edit
]
Major Allied naval air attacks and bombardments of targets in Japan during July and August 1945
The US Navy conducted its first attacks against the Japanese home islands in mid-February 1945. This operation was undertaken primarily to destroy Japanese aircraft that could attack the US Navy and Marine Corps forces involved with the
landing on Iwo Jima
on 19 February, and was conducted by
Task Force 58
(TF 58). This task force was the US Navy's main striking force in the Pacific, and comprised 11
fleet carriers
, five
light aircraft carriers
and a powerful force of escorts.
[172]
TF 58 approached Japan undetected, and attacked airfields and aircraft factories in the Tokyo region on 16 and 17 February. The American naval aviators claimed 341 "kills" against Japanese aircraft and the destruction of a further 160 on the ground for the loss of 60 aircraft in combat and 28 in accidents. Several ships were also attacked and sunk in
Tokyo Bay
.
[173]
The actual Japanese aircraft losses in this operation are uncertain, however; the Imperial General Headquarters admitted losing 78 aircraft in dogfights and did not provide a figure for those destroyed on the ground. TF 58's ships were not attacked during this period in Japanese waters, and on 18 February sailed south to provide direct support to the landings on Iwo Jima. The Task Force attempted a second raid against the Tokyo area on 25 February, but this operation was frustrated by bad weather. The American ships sailed south, and attacked
Okinawa
from 1 March.
[174]

TF 58 renewed its attacks on Japan in mid-March when it made a series of raids that sought to destroy Japanese aircraft within range of Okinawa prior to the landing there.
[175]
On 18 March, carrier aircraft struck Japanese airfields and other military facilities on
Kyushu
. The next day they
attacked Japanese warships at Kure and Kobe
, damaging the battleship
Yamato
and aircraft carrier
Amagi
. The Japanese fought back against these raids with kamikaze and conventional attacks, and inflicted light damage on three carriers on 18 March and severely damaged
USS
Franklin
the next day.
[176]
On 20 March, TF 58 sailed south but continued fighter sweeps over Kyushu to suppress Japanese aircraft. During the attacks on 18 and 19 March, the American naval aviators claimed to have destroyed 223 Japanese aircraft in the air and 250 on the ground, while the Japanese placed their losses as 161 of the 191 aircraft they committed in the air and an unspecified number on the ground.
[177]
From 23 March, TF 58 conducted strikes against Okinawa, though its aircraft made further sweeps of Kyushu on 28 and 29 March. Following the landing on 1 April, TF 58 provided air defense for the naval force off Okinawa and regularly conducted patrols over Kyushu. In an attempt to stem the large-scale Japanese air attacks against the Allied ships, part of TF 58 struck at kamikaze aircraft bases on Kyushu and
Shikoku
on 12 and 13 May.
[178]
On 27 May, Admiral
William Halsey
assumed command of the Fifth Fleet (redesignated the Third Fleet) from Admiral
Raymond A. Spruance
. TF 58, renumbered TF 38, continued operations off Okinawa in late May and June, and on 2 and 3 June one of its task groups attacked airfields on Kyushu.
[179]
Another attack was made against these airfields on 8 June; two days later, TF 38 left Japanese waters for a period of recuperation at
Leyte
in the Philippines.

On 1 July, TF 38 sailed from Leyte to strike at the Japanese home islands. At this time the Task Force comprised nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts.
[182]
Halsey sought to coordinate his fleet's attacks during the last months of the war with those of the USAAF's land-based aircraft, but the two forces often operated separately.
[183]
On 10 July TF 38's aircraft conducted raids on airfields in the Tokyo region, destroying several aircraft on the ground. No Japanese fighters were encountered in the air, however, as they were being kept in reserve for a planned large-scale suicide attack on the Allied fleet.
[184]
[185]
Following this raid TF 38 steamed north, and began a major attack on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 July. These strikes continued the next day, and sank eight of the 12 railway car ferries which carried coal from Hokkaido to Honshu and damaged the remaining four. Many other ships were also destroyed in this area, including 70 out of the 272 small sailing ships which carried coal between the islands. Once again no Japanese aircraft opposed this attack, though 25 were destroyed on the ground.
[186]
The loss of the railway car ferries reduced the amount of coal shipped from Hokkaido to Honshu by 80 percent, which greatly hindered production in Honshu's factories.
[187]
This operation has been described as the single most effective strategic air attack of the Pacific War.
[188]
TF 38's battleships and cruisers also began a series of
bombardments of industrial targets
on 14 July which continued until almost the end of the war.
[189]
Around 2,900 people were killed in the bombing of Hokkaido on 14 and 15 July.
[181]
Following the attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu TF 38 sailed south and was reinforced by the main body of the
British Pacific Fleet
, which was designated Task Force 37 and included another four fleet carriers.
[190]
[191]
Strikes on the Tokyo area on 17 July were disrupted by bad weather, but the next day aircraft from the fleet
attacked Yokosuka naval base
where they damaged the battleship
Nagato
and sank four other warships.
[191]
[192]
On 24, 25 and 28 July the Allied fleet
attacked Kure and the Inland Sea
and sank an aircraft carrier and three battleships, as well as two heavy cruisers, a light cruiser and several other warships.
[193]
A force of 79 USAAF Liberators flying from Okinawa participated in this attack on 28 July.
[194]
Allied casualties in this operation were heavy, however, as 126 aircraft were shot down.
[195]
On 29 and 30 July the carrier aircraft struck at
Maizuru
, sinking three small warships and 12 merchant vessels, before the fleet sailed east to avoid a typhoon and replenish its supplies.
[196]
Its next attacks against Japan took place on 9 and 10 August, and were directed at a buildup of Japanese aircraft in northern Honshu which Allied intelligence believed were to be used to conduct a commando raid against the B-29 bases in the Marianas. The naval aviators claimed to have destroyed 251 aircraft in their attacks on 9 August and damaged a further 141.
[197]
On 13 August, TF 38's aircraft attacked the Tokyo region again and claimed to have destroyed 254 Japanese aircraft on the ground and 18 in the air. Another raid was launched against Tokyo on the morning of 15 August, and the 103 aircraft of its first wave attacked their targets. The second wave aborted its attack when word was received that Japan had agreed to surrender. Several Japanese aircraft were shot down while attempting to attack TF 38 later that day, however.

Raids from Iwo Jima and Okinawa
[

A

Iwo Jima
USAAF P-51 Mustang fighters of the VII Fighter Command stationed at Iwo Jima from March 1945 were initially used mainly to escort B-29s. They also conducted a series of independent ground attack missions against targets in the home islands.
[200]
The first of these operations took place on 16 April, when 57 P-51s strafed
Kanoya Air Field
in Kyushu.
[201]
In operations conducted between 26 April and 22 June the American fighter pilots claimed the destruction of 64 Japanese aircraft and damage to another 180 on the ground, as well as a further ten shot down in flight; these claims were lower than the American planners had expected, however, and the raids were considered unsuccessful. USAAF losses were 11 P-51s to enemy action and seven to other causes.
[202]
Due to the lack of Japanese air opposition to the American bomber raids, VII Fighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and
barrage balloons
.
[203]
By the end of the war, VII Fighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway
rolling stock
. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.
[204]
From May 1945 aircraft of the USAAF's
Fifth Air Force
and
Seventh Air Force
, which were grouped under the
Far East Air Force
(FEAF), also attacked targets in Kyushu and western Honshu from bases in Okinawa and other locations in the
Ryukyu Islands
. These raids formed part of the preparation for the invasion of Japan.
[205]
From 17 May,
P-47 Thunderbolt
fighters flying from the Ryukyus made frequent day and night patrols over Kyushu to disrupt the Japanese air units there. On 21 June an additional fighter group joined this effort, and the campaign was reinforced by bombers and another fighter group from 1 July. While these American operations were initially fiercely contested, from early July onwards they encountered little opposition as the Japanese aircraft were withdrawn so that they could be preserved for later operations. Between 1 and 13 July, the Americans flew 286 medium and heavy bomber sorties over Kyushu without loss. As the fighters met few Japanese aircraft, they were mainly used to attack transportation infrastructure and targets of opportunity; these included at least two
strafing
attacks on groups of civilians.
[206]
Attacks on airfields and transportation infrastructure in southern Japan continued until the end of the war. By this time the Fifth Air Force's bombers had flown 138 sorties against airfields in Kyushu and the Seventh Air Force had conducted a further 784. Road and railway bridges were attacked by both fighters and bombers, and the city of Kagoshima was frequently bombed. Seventh Air Force B-24 Liberators also bombed the railway terminals in the port of Nagasaki on 31 July and 1 August. While these raids were focused on tactical targets, the Okinawa-based aircraft made several strategic attacks against industrial facilities; these included an unsuccessful raid on a coal liquefaction plant at Ōmuta on 7 August. Bombers of the Fifth and Seventh Air Forces also made firebombing attacks against
Tarumizu
on 5 August, Kumamoto on 10 August and
Kurume
the next day. The FEAF staged its last attacks against Japan on 12 August; aircraft were dispatched on 14 August but recalled while en route to their targets. Overall, the two air forces flew 6,435 sorties against targets in Kyushu during July and August for the loss of 43 aircraft to Japanese anti-aircraft guns and fighters.
[207]
Japanese military response
[
edit
]
Air defenses
[
edit
]
Japan's air defenses were unable to stop the Allied air attacks.
[208]
Owing to the short range of the country's land-based
radar
, and Allied attacks on IJN
picket ships
, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese
signals intelligence
units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by eavesdropping on the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict the target of the attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to
scramble
and reach the bombers' cruising altitude before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters.
[209]
Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due to the difficulty of intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their efforts as being futile.
[142]
From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide ramming attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; by the end of the war, ramming tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.
[210]
A recovered and preserved
Kawanishi N1K
fighter which may have been operated by one of the six Japanese airmen from the
343rd Kōkūtai
(Air Group) who were downed over the
Bungo strait
on 24 July 1945
Air combat was most intense in late 1944 and early 1945. Following the first B-29 raids on Tokyo, the number of IJN aircraft assigned to air defense duties was greatly increased and all 12-centimeter (4.7 in) guns were allocated to protect the capital.
[210]
Fighters stationed to defend Japan's main industrial areas frequently intercepted American air raids between 24 November 1944 and 25 February 1945, and inflicted significant losses for a period. The number of fighters available declined from late January, however.
[211]
Poor coordination between the IJAAF and IJN also continued to hamper Japan's defensive efforts throughout this period.
[212]
The Americans suffered few losses from Japanese fighters during the night raids which were conducted from March 1945 until the end of the war.
[213]
Resistance to the air raids decreased sharply from April 1945. On 15 April the IJAAF and IJN air defense units were belatedly placed under a single command when the
Air General Army
was formed under the command of General
Masakazu Kawabe
, but by this time the fighter force's effectiveness had been greatly reduced due to high rates of casualties in training accidents and combat. Due to the poor standard of the remaining pilots and the deployment of P-51 Mustangs to escort B-29s, the Japanese leadership decided in April to withdraw their remaining fighters from combat. These aircraft were placed in reserve to counterattack the anticipated
Allied invasion
.
[214]
As a result, few of the subsequent Allied raids were intercepted.
[214]
The effectiveness of Japanese anti-aircraft batteries also decreased during 1945 as the collapse of the national economy led to severe shortages of ammunition.
[214]
Moreover, as the anti-aircraft guns were mainly stationed near major industrial areas, many of the raids on small cities were almost unopposed.
[215]
Imperial General Headquarters decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, but by this time there were too few fighters available for this change of tactics to have any effect.
[216]
The number of fighters assigned to the Air General Army peaked at just over 500 during June and July, but most frontline units had relatively few serviceable aircraft.
[217]
During the last weeks of the war Superfortresses were able to operate with near impunity owing to the weakness of the Japanese air defenses; LeMay later claimed that during this period "it was safer to fly a combat mission over Japan than it was to fly a B-29 training mission back in the United States".
[218]
Overall, Japanese fighters shot down 74 B-29s, anti-aircraft guns accounted for a further 54, and 19 were downed by a combination of anti-aircraft guns and fighters. IJAAF and IJN losses during the defense of Japan were 1,450 aircraft in combat and another 2,750 to other causes.

Japanese war crimes
A captured crew member of a downed B-29, July 1945
Many of the Allied airmen who were captured after being shot down over Japan were mistreated. On 8 September 1944, the
Cabinet of Japan
directed that indiscriminate bombing constituted a
war crime
.
[220]
There was, however, no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft at the time.
[221]
As a result of the cabinet directions, captured Allied airmen were subject to trial and possible execution.
[222]
The frequency of such executions differed between military districts, however. While no airmen were executed in the Tōbu district (eastern
Musashi
), which included Tokyo, those captured in the
Tōkai
,
Chūbu
and Seibu (western Musashi) districts were sometimes killed after a brief trial or
summarily executed
by the
Kempeitai
("Military Police Corps").
[223]
For instance, 33 American airmen were killed by IJA personnel at Fukuoka, including 15 who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on 15 August.
[224]
Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the men into custody.
[225]
In addition to these killings, most captured B-29 crewmen were brutally interrogated by the Kempeitai.
[226]
Of the approximately 545 Allied airmen who were captured in the Japanese home islands (excluding the Kuril and Bonin Islands), 132 were executed and 29 were killed by civilians. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately left in a prison in Tokyo during the 25/26 May raid on the city.
[227]
[228]
Between six
[229]
and eight
[230]
US airmen shot down on 5 May were subjected to
vivisection
at the
Kyushu Imperial University
; Professor
Fukujirō Ishiyama
and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations.
[230]
Many of the Japanese personnel responsible for the deaths of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the
Yokohama War Crimes Trials
following the war. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.

Atomic bombings and final attacks
[
edit
]
The
mushroom cloud
from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945
Main article:
Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Beginning in 1942 the United States, with assistance from Britain and other Allied countries, devoted considerable resources to developing
nuclear weapons
through the
Manhattan Project
. In December 1944 the USAAF's
509th Composite Group
was formed under the command of Colonel
Paul Tibbets
to deliver these weapons once they were complete; it deployed to Tinian during May and June 1945.
[232]
The "
Trinity
" test of the first nuclear bomb was successfully conducted on 16 July.
[233]
Four days later the 509th Composite Group's modified "
Silverplate
" B-29s began flying practice raids against Japanese cities, each armed with a single high-explosive
"pumpkin" bomb
; further practice missions took place on 24, 26 and 29 July. Japanese fighters did not attempt to intercept these aircraft and their bombing altitude of 30,000 feet (9,100 m) was beyond the range of most anti-aircraft guns.
[234]
Meanwhile, on 24 July President
Harry S. Truman
approved
[a]
the use of atomic bombs against Japan and the next day Spaatz received written orders to this effect. These orders specified that the first attack should be made after 3 August, and named
Hiroshima
,
Kokura
,
Niigata
and Nagasaki as targets.
[236]
Kyoto
, Japan's former imperial capital, had been included in an earlier version of the target list but Nagasaki was substituted on the direction of US Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson
owing to Kyoto's cultural value; the city had also been excluded from the urban firebombing raids on the same grounds.
[237]
[238]
On 26 July the United States, Britain and China issued the
Potsdam Declaration
, which demanded Japan's surrender after warning that the country would be devastated if the war continued. The Japanese government rejected the Allied demands on 28 July.
[239]
Hiroshima was attacked on 6 August. At 8:15 am local time the B-29
Enola Gay
, piloted by Tibbets, dropped the "
Little Boy
" atomic bomb over the center of the city. The resulting explosion killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed about 4.7 square miles (12 km
2
) of buildings.
[240]
The six American aircraft involved in this attack returned safely to the Marianas.
[241]
Postwar estimates of casualties from the attack on Hiroshima range from 35,000 to 50,000 fatalities and 69,000 to 151,000 injured.
[242]
More subsequently died as a result of radiation and other injuries.
[243]
[244]
Of the survivors of the bombing, 171,000 were rendered homeless.
[245]
Following the attack, a statement from President Truman was broadcast to announce that the United States had used an atomic bomb against Hiroshima and that further air attacks would be conducted on Japan's industrial facilities and transportation network. The statement included a threat that if Japan did not surrender under the terms specified in the Potsdam Declaration it would be subjected to "a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth".
[246]
Two days later, daylight incendiary raids were conducted against the cities of Yawata and
Fukuyama
; these attacks destroyed 21 percent of Yawata's urban area and over 73 percent of Fukuyama.
[161]
Japanese aircraft intercepted the force dispatched against Yawata and shot down a B-29 and five of the escorting P-47s for the loss of approximately 12 fighters.
[247]
Part of Nagasaki six weeks after the atomic bombing
The second atomic bomb attack was made on 9 August. On this day, the B-29
Bockscar
was dispatched to attack Kokura with the "
Fat Man
" bomb. The city was found to be covered in smoke and haze, however; as a result, the plane's pilot, Major
Charles Sweeney
, decided to attack the secondary target of Nagasaki instead. The bomb was dropped at 10:58 am local time, and the resulting 20
kiloton
explosion destroyed 1.45 square miles (3.8 km
2
) of buildings in the
Urakami
district.
[248]
[249]
Official Japanese figures issued in the late 1990s state the total number of people killed as a result of this attack exceeded 100,000.
[250]
The attack also crippled the city's industrial production; steel production was set back by one year, electrical power was severely reduced for two months and arms production was greatly reduced.
[251]
All the American aircraft involved in the operation returned safely.
[252]
The
Soviet invasion of Manchuria
also began on 9 August, and the
Red Army
advanced rapidly.
[253]
On this day, B-29s dropped three million leaflets on Japanese cities warning that atomic bombs would be used to destroy all the country's military resources unless the Emperor ended the war.
[254]
At this time a third atomic bomb was expected to be ready by the end of August.
[255]
Eight bombs were scheduled to have been completed by November, and General
George Marshall
, the
Chief of Staff of the United States Army
, was advocating that they be reserved for use against tactical targets in support of the planned invasion rather than be dropped on cities.
[256]
The Japanese government began negotiations with the Allies about the terms of surrender on 10 August.
[257]
During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315th Bombardment Wing against an oil target on the night of 9/10 August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10 August. The next day, President Truman ordered a halt to the bombing due to the possibility that it would be interpreted as a sign that the peace negotiations had failed.
[258]
On 11 August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure.
[259]
On 13 August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's conditional offer to surrender over Japanese cities.
[260]
Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14 August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of
Kumagaya
and
Isesaki
were firebombed.
[261]
[262]
While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as he did not want to risk the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over.
[263]
These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15 August
Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender
.
[264]
After the war
[
edit
]
US Navy carrier aircraft flying over the Allied fleet in Tokyo Bay following the
Japanese surrender
on 2 September 1945
[265]
Limited air operations continued over Japan in the weeks following the Japanese government's decision to surrender. On 17 and 18 August,
B-32 Dominators
flying reconnaissance missions from Okinawa were attacked by IJN fighters near Tokyo.
[266]
From 17 August the Twentieth Air Force was made responsible for supplying Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan, Korea and China until the prisoners were evacuated. Supply drops began 10 days later, and continued until 20 September. During this period the B-29s flew almost 1,000 sorties and delivered close to 4,500 tons of supplies.
[267]
Eight aircraft crashed during these missions and another was damaged by a Soviet fighter over Korea.
[268]
The 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, which had operated over Japan throughout the bombing campaign, also continued its photo reconnaissance and mapping flights over the home islands during this period.
[269]
While Spaatz ordered that B-29s and fighters fly continuous
show of force
patrols of the Tokyo area from 19 August until the formal surrender ceremony took place, these operations were initially frustrated by bad weather and logistics problems. The first patrols were not flown until 30 August, when they were made in conjunction with the landing of General
Douglas MacArthur
and the US Army's
11th Airborne Division
at
Atsugi airfield
.
[270]
A similar operation was conducted the next day, and on 2 September 462 B-29s and many naval aircraft overflew the Allied fleet in Tokyo Bay following the surrender ceremony on board
USS
Missouri
.
[271]
Allied air units participated in the
occupation of Japan
after the war. Advance parties of the FEAF began to arrive at Atsugi airfield on 30 August, and units of the Fifth Air Force were established across the home islands during September and October.
[272]
Besides transporting occupation troops, the Fifth Air Force conducted armed patrols over Japan and Korea as well and also made many photo reconnaissance and mapping sorties.
[273]
Royal Australian Air Force
, British
Royal Air Force
,
Royal New Zealand Air Force
, US Navy and United States Marine Corps air units were also deployed to Japan for occupation duties.
[274]
[275]
There was no Japanese resistance to the Allied occupation, and the number of air units stationed in the country was gradually reduced from late 1945.
[276]
Japan's bomb-damaged cities were rebuilt after the war. War damage and the need to rehouse soldiers and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2 million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions.
[277]
In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the emphasis of its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities.
[278]
The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government.
[279]
The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however.
[280]
In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout, though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations.
[281]
Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not until well after the war that major
urban improvement
projects were undertaken.
[282]

Casualties and damage

Aerial view of Tokyo following the war
Aerial view of Osaka following the war
The air attacks on Japan caused hundreds of thousands of casualties, though estimates of the number who were killed and wounded vary considerably. The strategic attacks by the Twentieth Air Force caused most of the casualties and damage. The figures most frequently cited in the literature on the campaign are sourced from the USSBS report
The Effects of Bombing on Health and Medical Services in Japan
which estimated that 333,000 Japanese were killed and 473,000 wounded. Included in this figure were an estimated 120,000 dead and 160,000 injured in the two atomic bomb attacks.
[283]
[284]
Another USSBS report,
The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japanese Morale
, included a much higher estimate of 900,000 killed and 1.3 million injured which was reached by a Japanese research team using a
statistical sampling
methodology. While this figure is also occasionally cited, the USSBS' investigators regarded the work of their statistical teams as unsatisfactory, and the researchers were unable to calculate the error rate of this estimate.
[285]
The
postwar Japanese government
calculated in 1949 that 323,495 people had been killed by air attacks in the home islands.
[286]
The destruction of buildings housing government records during air raids contributed to the uncertainty about the number of casualties.
[287]
The Twentieth Air Force lost 414 B-29s during attacks on Japan. Over 2,600 American bomber crew members were killed, including POWs who died in captivity, and a further 433 were wounded.
[4]
The following table provides examples of the estimated number of Japanese casualties from air attack in different sources:

[295]
Much of Japan's industrial capacity was also destroyed by Allied bombing. Over 600 major industrial facilities were destroyed or badly damaged, contributing to a large decline in production.
[296]
Absenteeism caused by the air attacks further reduced output.
[297]
It is not possible to determine the exact damage bombing caused to Japan's economy, however, as the Allied naval blockade also contributed to general breakdown which occurred from late 1944. Statistics compiled by the USSBS show a correlation between the number of B-29 sorties directed at different industries and the amount by which their production declined, but air attacks were not the only reason for these differences.
[298]
In addition to the heavy bomber attacks, the operations by Allied aircraft carriers tightened the blockade by disrupting Japanese coastal shipping; the naval aircraft were unable to carry enough bombs to seriously damage Japanese industrial plants, however.
[299]
Compounding the effects of the air attacks, Japan's rice crop of 1945 failed. The resulting shortage of rice caused widespread malnutrition, and mass starvation would have occurred had the war continued.
[300]
In financial terms, the Allied air campaign and attacks on merchant ships destroyed between one third and a quarter of Japan's wealth.
[301]
The attacks also caused extensive damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40 percent of the urban area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed.
[302]
This included the loss of about 2.5 million
housing units
, which rendered 8.5 million people homeless.
[5]
The urban area attacks reduced the morale of the Japanese population, and postwar
surveys
conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were the most important factor in convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric.
[303]
However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.
[304]
Allied air raids significantly influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air attacks on the home islands as the single most important factor which influenced their decision to end the war.
[305]
In particular, Prime Minister
Kantarō Suzuki
stated that the combination of the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender.
[306]
[307]
To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90 percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war.
[308]
The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.
[309]
Morality
[
edit
]
A woman and her child outside their bombed home in
Ebisu, Tokyo
following the war
There has been debate over the morality of the air campaign against Japan since World War II. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and the few people who criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.
[310]
The moral concerns over the attacks have focused on the large number of civilian casualties and property damage they caused. For this and other reasons, British philosopher
A. C. Grayling
has concluded that the Allied area bombing campaigns against both Japan and Germany constituted moral crimes.
[311]
Mark Selden
described the summer 1945 peak of the bombing campaign as "still perhaps unrivaled in the magnitude of human slaughter" and stated that the factors contributing to its intensity were a combination of "technological breakthroughs, American nationalism, and the erosion of moral and political scruples about killing of civilians, perhaps intensified by the racism that crystallized in the Pacific theater".
[312]
Edwin P. Hoyt
wrote in 1987 that Japanese people commonly regard the Allied bombing of civilians as the worst atrocity of the war.
[313]
It has also been suggested that
anti-Japanese sentiment
was a factor motivating the USAAF's emphasis on firebombing during the campaign against Japan while most of its raids on Germany used precision bombing tactics. However, historian
Richard B. Frank
argues that this difference was attributable to the evolution in views towards bombing over the course of the war, the limited intelligence on the structure of the Japanese economy available to the Allies and the much greater vulnerability of Japanese cities to incendiary bombs.
[314]
According to
Robert McNamara
, who served as an officer in the Army Air Forces under General Curtis LeMay during the bombings of Japan, LeMay once said that had the United States lost the war they would have been tried for war crimes, McNamara agrees with this assessment. McNamara believed that, "He (LeMay), and I'd say I, were behaving as war criminals." and that "LeMay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost. But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?"
[315]
The moral defense of the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an argument that they saved lives by shortening the war.
[316]
The USSBS concluded that the effects of strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr supported this assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities was the key factor motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war.
[317]
American historian
Barrett Tillman
has also written that area attacks were unavoidable because, owing to the limitations of their
bombsight
and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.
[299]

The atomic bomb attacks have been the
subject of long-running controversy
. While conventional attacks inflicted more damage and casualties on Japan than the atomic bombs, discussions of the air campaign have been focused on the use of nuclear weapons.
[318]
Shortly after the atomic bombings an opinion poll found that about 85 percent of Americans supported the use of atomic weapons, and the wartime generation believed that they had saved millions of lives. Criticisms over the decision to use the bombs have increased over time, however. Arguments made against the attacks include that Japan would have eventually surrendered and that the attacks were made to either intimidate the Soviet Union or justify the Manhattan Project. In 1994, an opinion poll found that 55 percent of Americans supported the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[319]
When registering the only dissenting opinion of the judges involved in the
International Military Tribunal for the Far East
in 1947, Justice
Radhabinod Pal
argued that Japan's leadership had not conspired to commit atrocities and stated that the decision to conduct the atomic bomb attacks was the clearest example of a direct order to conduct "indiscriminate murder" during the Pacific War.
[320]
Since then, Japanese academics, such as
Yuki Tanaka
and
Tsuyoshi Hasegawa
, have argued that use of the bombs was immoral and constituted a war crime.
[321]
In contrast, President Truman and, more recently, historians such as
Paul Fussell
have argued that the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified as they induced the Japanese surrender.
[316]
On two occasions Japanese citizens have sued their government for damages from the bombings, arguing that the government is culpable for having waged a "reckless war" that provoked the bombings and for requiring civilians to remain in the targeted areas. In December 2009 the
Tokyo District Court
dismissed one of the suits, stating that it was not possible to identify individuals who deserve compensation as almost all Japanese suffered as a result of the war. The court also ruled that any compensation should be allocated through the legislative, rather than judicial, process. In December 2011, the Osaka District Court handed down a similar ruling, adding that the government did not violate its constitution in its treatment of bombing victims. This judgement stated that there had not been "unreasonable disparity" in how civilians, soldiers, and atomic bomb survivors were treated, and that the government had showed "no gross deviation from its discretionary right in not legislating for redress measures".

Abraham Davenport
(1715-1789) was a
Connecticut councillor
and judge from
Stamford
.  He was celebrated in a poem by
John Greenleaf Whittier
for his stoical reaction to
New England's Dark Day
(1780).
Personal life
[
edit
]
The Davenport homestead (
c.
1882
)
The grandson of
New Haven Colony
founder
John Davenport
,
[1]
Abraham Davenport was born in the
Connecticut Colony
town of
Stamford
in 1715 to John and Elizabeth (
née
Maltby
).  Davenport's home in Stamford was on Main Street, near the corner of Summer Street.
[2]
Davenport graduated from
Yale College
with his
Bachelor of Arts
in 1732.  He married Elizabeth Huntington on 16 November 1750 in
Windham, Connecticut
, and she died on 17 December 1773; Davenport remarried to Martha Fitch on 8 August 1776 in Stamford.  In the aftermath of the
American Revolutionary War
, Davenport took ill and wounded US soldiers into home to care for their recovery.  Abraham Davenport died in
Danbury, Connecticut
on 20 November 1789 at age 74;
[1]
he was buried in
Northfield, Connecticut
, bequeathing that land and
£200
(equivalent to £26,156 in 2021) to the church.
[2]
Public service
[
edit
]
In 1737, Davenport was the Stamford town
tithingman
, and in 1738, he was the town
surveyor
.  He also served on the Stamford
board of selectmen
(1746-1777) for 31 years, and in the
Connecticut State Militia
as a
colonel
.
[2]
Legislator
[
edit
]
Davenport was a member of the
Connecticut House of Representatives
from 1759-1766, and the
Connecticut Council
from 1766-1784.
[2]
On
New England's Dark Day
(19 May 1780), that body was deliberating on an amendment regulating
fisheries
of
Alosinae
and
alewife
when the House adjourned due to darkness.  Upon the suggestion that the Council should do the same, Davenport is reported to have said, "I am against adjournment. The
day of judgment
is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for an adjournment; if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore that candles may be brought."  Candles were brought, deliberation continued, and the amendment was passed in the Council.
[3]
"Dark Day" by Delos Palmer
In his 1866 poem "Abraham Davenport" (
Tent on the Beach
),
[2]
the
Quaker
poet
John Greenleaf Whittier
lauded the legislator: "And there he stands in memory to this day, Erect, self-poised, a rugged face, half seen Against the background of unnatural dark, A witness to the ages as they pass, That simple duty hath no place for fear."
[3]
In November 1934, Delos Palmer—working under a
Works Progress Administration
commission—painted a Dark-Day mural of Davenport and Connecticut Governor
Jonathan Trumbull
in the Stamford city courtroom.  At its dedication, Judge Charles Davenport Lockwood said the art "should be an inspiration and a lesson during these days of hard times [the
Great Depression
]."  During
his 1960 presidential campaign
,
John F. Kennedy
made several references to Davenport and his stance on the Dark Day.
[2]
Judiciary
[
edit
]
Despite his lack of formal legal training, Davenport was appointed
judge
of the
Fairfield County Court
, the
Maritime Court of Fairfield County
, and Stamford's
probate court
(from 1768-1790).
[2]
In his waning years, Davenport served as the
chief justice
of the Connecticut
Court of Common Pleas
.  The judge was in
Danbury, Connecticut
hearing a case when he suffered a
myocardial infarction
.  He allegedly worked through the pain until the case was sent to the jury, then retired to his chamber and died.

USS
Maury
(AGS-16)
was a
hydrographic surveying ship
in service with the
United States Navy
from 1945 to 1969.
The ship was originally laid down under a
Maritime Commission
contract (MC Hull 1897) as
USS
Renate
(AKA-36)
on 21 November 1944 at
Providence, R.I.
, by
Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc.
; launched on 31 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph L. Baker; and
commissioned
at State Pier No.1, Providence, on 28 February 1945.
Renate
was an
Artemis
-class
attack cargo ship
named after the minor planet
575 Renate
. "Renate" is a
female
German
surname
derived from
Latin
"renatus" (
= born again
). The ship was later converted for hydrographic missions and renamed
Maury
(AGS-16) in 1946, named after the astronomer and hydrographer
Matthew Fontaine Maury
.
Service history
[
edit
]
World War II, 1945-1946
[
edit
]
After completing her fitting-out at
Boston
,
Massachusetts
(USA),
Renate
conducted shakedown training in
Chesapeake Bay
(13-19 March), after which time she underwent post-shakedown availability at the
Norfolk Navy Yard
, Portsmouth, Virginia (USA); she ultimately sailed for the
Panama Canal Zone
on 31 March 1945. After transiting the canal, she arrived at
Balboa
on 6 April, and sailed thence two days later, bound for
Hawaiian
waters and steaming independently.
Renate
reached
Pearl Harbor
on 21 April, underwent an inspection six days later, and completed discharging cargo on the 29th.
USS
Renate
(AKA-36) at Sasebo in 1945.
Bringing cargo-loading operations to completion on 13 May,
Renate
embarked 197 enlisted passengers — sailors, marines, and soldiers — and two naval officers for transportation the following day, and sailed for the
Marshall Islands
. Steaming independently, her men standing daily dawn and dusk alerts, the attack cargo ship crossed the 180th meridian on 18 May, and ultimately reached
Eniwetok
on the 22nd. Pushing on, bound for the western
Carolines
, on 5 June, she followed a lone course to
Ulithi
, arriving on 9 June. Next assigned to convoy UOK-36,
Renate
got underway for
Okinawa
on 10 July, dropping anchor in
Buckner Bay
on the 14th. Interrupting cargo operations to sortie on 19 July to evade a
typhoon
, she ultimately completed discharging cargo five days later, getting underway to return to Ulithi on 25 July with convoy OKU-16.
Anchoring in Ulithi lagoon on the last day of July,
Renate
got underway on 2 August for Pearl Harbor. Again steaming independently, she crossed the
International Date Line
on 10 August, and reached her destination on the 13th. Shifting to Kahului,
Maui
, ten days later, she completed cargo operations the following day, and sailed to return to Pearl on the 25th.
Departing on 14 May, she returned to Hawaii the day before the
Surrender of Japan
and was assigned to Operation "Campus", the
occupation
of the Japan's home islands. She got underway for
Kyūshū
1 September, mooring 16 days later at
Sasebo
where she disembarked units of the
U.S. 5th Marine Division
. Completing another occupation troop lift, from the
Philippines
to Sasebo, in early October, she joined in operation
Operation "Magic Carpet"
, the transportation of veterans back to the United States. With
San Francisco
as her terminus she completed two "Magic Carpet" runs by mid January 1946.
The next month she sailed for the
East Coast
, arriving at
Norfolk
on the 26th.
Conversion to survey ship, 1946
[
edit
]
In June 1946, she entered
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
for conversion to a survey ship and on 12 July was renamed
Maury
designated AGS-16. As
Maury
she emerged from the shipyard in October with a new silhouette. Electronic survey and sounding equipment, as well as photographic, printing, and repair shops had been added within her compartments and a helipad, helicopter, and sound boats had been provided topside. The boats would be used in charting positions and depths accurately, while the ship's helicopter would transport surveyors and their equipment to points ashore and perform aerial photographic missions.
On 6 January 1947
Maury
got underway for the Pacific and her first
hydrographic
mission, the charting of the waters around
Truk
and
Kwajalein
. Having added to navigational knowledge of those areas she sailed for San Francisco, arriving on 13 September and remaining until 11 July 1948. She then got underway for
New York City
where she reported for duty with Service Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 10 August.
Atlantic Fleet, 1948-1959
[
edit
]
During 1949, 1950, and 1951,
Maury
made three 8-month cruises to the
Persian Gulf
, constructing charts of those waters, accompanied by the tugs
Allegheny
and
Stallion
. In October 1952, in concert with
USS
Sheldrake
(AGS-19)
and
USS
Prevail
(AGS-20)
she began a resurvey of the North
Atlantic
, to correct existing false soundings on navigational charts and studying methods for hurricane and weather predictions. Through 1957 she served in the Western Atlantic, surveying as far north as
Newfoundland
in the summer months and working to the south, as far as the
West Indies
, during the winter.
In 1958
Maury
returned to the
Mediterranean
for an abbreviated deployment, from 3 February to 9 May. In July her North Atlantic resurvey missions were extended and she crossed the ocean to chart the waters in and around the
Shetland
and
Faroe Islands
. Throughout this period, while fulfilling her primary assignment of correcting navigational charts, she added to meteorological knowledge by studying the North Atlantic's weather patterns, particularly with regard to
hurricanes
.
Early in the Spring of 1959
Maury
again passed through the
Straits of Gibraltar
. Continuing on to the Eastern Mediterranean she began a study of the
Turkish
coast. By September she was ready to extend that survey to the Turkish
Black Sea
coast and on the 17th and 18th transited the
Dardanelles
.
Maury
thus became the first U.S. naval unit to enter the Black Sea since 1945. Also Odessa Russia 1959.
Pacific Fleet, 1960-1969
[
edit
]
Maury
in Thailand, circa 1961.
The next year, 1960,
Maury
was transferred to the
Pacific Fleet
and by 22 March was operating out of Pearl Harbor. Attached to the 7th Fleet's logistic support group during her extended cruises, she completed a preliminary survey of the
Gulf of Siam
in preparation for her next long range assignment, an accurate survey of designated areas of the southwestern Pacific and Indian Oceans. After modernization at Pearl Harbor, she returned to the Gulf of Siam in December with
USS
Serrano
. Working in concert,
Maury
concentrated on hydrographic survey, while
Serrano
gathered information on the physical and chemical makeup of the waters and ocean floor. During their 1961, 1962 and 1963
7th Fleet
tours, the oceanographic vessels charted and collected data on the Gulf of Siam, the
Andaman Sea
, the
Straits of Malacca
and areas of the
Philippines
, punctuating those tours with missions of mercy as the occasion demanded.
On 1 February 1965 Maury departed
Pearl Harbor
for a 4-month survey of the continental shelf off
Buenaventura
,
Colombia
. Returning to Oahu on 2 June, she began preparations for her return to Southeast Asia. Departing on 15 November she soon commenced a 7-month survey of the coast of
South Vietnam
. Concentrating on the
Mekong Delta
area during that cruise, she has resumed her study of the Vietnamese coast with each annual deployment. Into 1969 her efforts added significantly to knowledge of the characteristics of the coastal area in which U.S. naval forces conducted
riverine warfare
and
amphibious operations
.
After completing her last operational survey operations, off the coast of the
Republic of Korea
,
Maury
sailed for the United States. Pausing at Pearl Harbor en route, she stood out for the
West Coast
on her final voyage on 1 December 1969.
Decommissioning
[
edit
]
She reached San Francisco on 8 December 1969, off-loading fuel, ammunition, and vehicles before shifting to the
Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility
,
Mare Island
, Vallejo, California (USA), later the same day. Decommissioned on 19 December 1969,
Maury
was stricken from the
Naval Vessel Register
the same day. The ship remained at the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility until transferred to the custody of the
Maritime Administration
(MARAD) on 26 June 1970. Taken to MARAD's
Suisun Bay
, California, berthing area, she remained there until sold to the National Steel and Metal Co., of Terminal Island, Calif., on 10 August 1973 to be broken up for scrap.

NC 111 was established in 1930 as a new primary routing between NC 11, in
Kornegay
, and US 70/NC 10, in Goldsboro; the highway was mostly
graded
dirt
, serving the
Drummersville
community.
[2]
By 1935, NC 111 was extended through Goldsboro to
Cherry Hospital
, replacing NC 402.

Also in 1935, NC 111 was realigned in Wayne County and was extended south on new primary routing to NC 24, four miles (6.4 km) west of Beulaville. In 1940, NC 111 was rerouted at Albertson.
[4]
NC 111 along Catherine Lake Road
Between 1939 and 1944, NC 111 was rerouted in Goldsboro, to accommodate the
United States Army Air Corps
Technical Training School (later becoming
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base
), it was moved from Slocumb Street to Piedmont Road.
[5]
By 1948, NC 111 was rerouted southeast of NC 11 to Beulaville, ending at NC 24/NC 41; its old alignment along Williams Road was downgraded to secondary road (SR 1701). By 1949, NC 111 was truncated at
US 70A
/
US 117A
/
NC 581
in Goldsboro; its routing to Cherry Hospital was replaced by NC 581.
[6]
In 1959, NC 111 was rerouted for Seymour Johnson Air Force Base again, to its current approach to US 70; its old alignment became secondary roads Old 111 Highway (SR 1710) and Piedmont Airline Road (SR 1755).
[7]
In August 1984, NC 111 was extended, along with NC 41, south to Chinquapin, where it split off and continued west to its current southern terminus at US 258/NC 24, in Catherine Lake. This routing was initially established as a new primary routing for
NC 144
a month prior, but was subsequently replaced before any actual signage was made.
[8]
[9]
On January 1, 1985, NC 111 was rerouted onto new northern bypass routing of Goldsboro, along with US 70; it then was extended as a new primary routing north to NC 222, near Eureka. The former Goldsboro downtown alignment was replaced with US 70 Business.
[10]
In May 1994, NC 111 was extended north along NC 222 to north of Saratoga, where it continues along new primary routing to Tarboro. In Tarboro, it took Wilson Street to 
Main Street south, crossing the Tar River, into Princeville and then overlapping briefly with US 258 before continuing east along Greenwood Boulevard. At Fountain Fork, NC 111 turns northeast and ends at its current northern terminus at NC 11/NC 44, in Oak City.
[11]
In July 1994, NC 111, and other primary routes, were rerouted out of Tarboro and onto US 64/US 258 over the Tar River to Princeville.

The
New Philharmonia Orchestra of Massachusetts
, founded in 1995, is a 75-member mostly non-professional regional
orchestra
based in
Newton, Massachusetts
. The
"New Phil"
performs in at the
First Baptist Church in Newton (Massachusetts)
, and on occasion at
Mission Church
in
Boston's
Roxbury
neighborhood, as well as other locations in the region.
The founding music director of the orchestra was
Ronald Knudsen
, a violinist in the
Boston Symphony Orchestra
since 1965 and occasional guest conductor of the
Boston Pops
Orchestra.
[1]
After Knudsen's death in March 2015,
[2]
Francisco Noya stepped in to conduct the final concert of the 2014-2015 season, served as principal conductor and musical advisor for the 2015-2016 season, and was appointed as the orchestra's second Music Director in 2016.
[3]
[4]
Noya is the Resident Conductor of the
Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra
and Music Director of the
Berklee Contemporary Symphony Orchestra
— and, like Knudsen, has often guest-conducted the Boston Pops.
The orchestra's programs include a mix of familiar and unfamiliar
classical
repertoire (including collaborations with local choruses), as well as new music, including commissions. In 2005, the New Philharmonia participated in the
Made in America'
commission from noted American composer
Joan Tower
,
[5]
and premiered a number of other pieces by local composers.  The 2009-2010 season included the Boston-area premiere of
blue cathedral
by
Jennifer Higdon
.  The 2005-2006 concert series included a performance of
Mahler
's
second symphony
, and the 2015-2016 concluded with a performance of
Beethoven
's
Choral Fantasy
.
Eminent soloists who have performed with the orchestra include the
flutist
Eugenia Zukerman
,
violinists
James Oliver Buswell IV
and
Stefan Jackiw
,
cellist
Matt Haimovitz
and pianists
Randall Hodgkinson
and
Benjamin Pasternack
, as well as many soloists drawn from the ranks of the Boston Symphony, including
Ann Hobson Pilot
,
Doriot Anthony Dwyer
,
Tatiana Dimitriades
,
Edwin Barker
,
Haldan Martinson
,
Daniel Katzen
,
Sato Knudsen
and
Keisuke Wakao
.  The orchestra's inaugural season featured a guest conducting appearance by
Keith Lockhart
, conductor of the
Boston Pops
.  Its fifteenth season was launched on July 1, 2009 with a concert in Boston's
Symphony Hall
, featuring French music for
organ
and orchestra, with
James David Christie
(organist of the Boston Symphony) as soloist.  The concert marked the opening night of the New England convention of the
American Guild of Organists
. On September 14, 2018, the orchestra presented a sold-out concert at Symphony Hall featuring the
Indigo Girls
.
[6]
The motto of the orchestra is
Music for All
.  In that spirit, the orchestra conducts active outreach programs in the Boston
public schools
and has strong links to other local school systems and civic organizations. The 2007-2008 season concluded with a benefit concert at the
Kennedy Library
attended by the mayor of Boston,
Thomas Menino
, honoring the orchestra's partnership with
John Hancock financial services
. Under this partnership, members of the orchestra have been offering supplemental music education programs in the
Oliver H. Perry elementary school
in South Boston.
[7]
The New Philharmonia Orchestra is a member of the
American Symphony Orchestra League
and the
New England Orchestra Consortium
.

The
Portland & Rochester Railroad
, established in 1867, was an important predecessor railway of the Rochester to Portland
branch line
of the
Boston and Maine Railroad
. It was founded in the merger of several smaller
shortline
rail transport
companies, the oldest being the shortline
York and Cumberland Railroad
which was formed in 1846 to connect the
seaport
facilities of
Portland, Maine
, to the
water powered
manufacturing and
textile
industries along the
Quampheagan Falls
on the
Salmon Falls River
in the twin towns of
South Berwick, Maine
, and
Rollinsford, New Hampshire
(ca 1850
[1]
).
A year later another investor group began a railway leading inland to the upcoming mill town of
Nashua, New Hampshire
, inspiring the easier to construct leg founded as the
Nashua & Rochester Railroad
(1847). The York and Cumberland opened to
Gorham, Maine
, in 1851 under the direction of Maine railroad pioneer
John A. Poor
and was extended in 1853. The York and Cumberland was reorganized as the
Portland and Rochester Railroad
in 1867, and was completed to
Rochester, New Hampshire
, in 1871, providing a connection from Canada via the
Grand Trunk Railway
in Portland to inland cities further west, including
Worcester, Massachusetts
, via a connection with the
Nashua and Rochester
.
[2]
While the Nashua and Rochester merged with the
Worcester & Nashua Railroad
to become the
Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad
in 1883, a company that in turn was leased by the Boston and Maine in 1886, the Portland and Maine remained independent until 1900, when it too was absorbed into the Boston and Maine as it grew into a regional giant.
[2]
The line continued to operate in full until in 1952, when the stretch between Rochester and
Springvale
was abandoned, but the line from Springvale to
Westbrook
operated from 1949 to 1961 as the
shortline
Sanford and Eastern Railroad
,
[3]
which also operated trackage between Springvale and Sanford that was once part of the
Atlantic Shore Line
interurban
system. Today only portions of the line in Westbrook and Portland still see traffic, being serviced by the
Portland Terminal Company
.

[1]
History
[
edit
]
The Coorparoo School of Arts and
RSL
Tooltip Returned and Services League of Australia
Memorial Hall was constructed in 1892 for the Council of the
Shire of Coorparoo
. The Council remained in the building until October 1925, when amalgamation of local governments occurred and Greater
City of Brisbane
was created. Since 1925, it has been used as a
School of Arts
.
[1]
The Divisional Boards Act 1879 established 74 local authorities in Queensland with Coorparoo administered as Subdivision 3 of the
Bulimba Divisional Board
. Primary concerns of the board included the maintenance and improvement of roads and bridges, the Bulimba ferry and water supply to river villages. In 1888 Coorparoo was represented on the Bulimba Divisional Board by
Frederick Thomas Brentnall
,
Frederick Wecker
and
John Douglas
. These men, along with other Coorparoo residents, claimed that more could be accomplished for the locality. They resigned from the Board and led demands for the creation of the Coorparoo Shire. The Shire of Coorparoo was proclaimed on 27 October 1888.
[1]
By 1892 the Councillors decided that a Shire Hall was a necessity. Two allotments on the corner of Cavendish Road and Council (now Halstead) streets were purchased.
Henry Wallace Atkinson
, a local architect, designed the Hall and it was built by a Mr Allibone at a cost of
£
514, plus
£
78 for architect's fees and
£
14 for seating. The Council moved in on 7 October 1892.
[1]
Constructed with gas fittings for six lamps, the Hall was the first gas lit building in the Shire, further, the first telephone in the district was installed on 1 November 1892. The Hall was hired out as a social club and played an important role in the social life of the district. The Roll of Honour was unveiled by
James Stodart
,
Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly
for
Logan
on 24 June 1916. The honour board is dedicated to the men and women of the District who served in the
World War I
.
[1]
With the amalgamation of local government authorities and the establishment of Greater City of Brisbane in 1925, a new use was sought for the shire hall. Local residents organised to form a School of Arts committee and, in 1928, the Trustees of the School of Arts contracted to pay the Council of the City of
Brisbane
£
1000.
[1]
In 1930 the Trustees accepted the offer of the Avondale Lodge to build a side verandah on the north-west elevation. The Trustees paid
£
200 for the fabric. The new wing was officially opened by Trustee and politician
Reginald King
, the Member of the
Queensland Legislative Assembly
for Logan on 19 July 1930. In 1938, the stage was removed providing more space in the Hall and a small stage was constructed at the rear.
[1]
In 1946, the Brisbane City Council began asking for payment of
£
750 which was owing on the purchase price of the hall, the alternative was to hand in the Hall's keys. Revenue was raised through a variety of activities, including renting the hall to the Coorparoo Kindergarten, and by 1948 the fund stood at over
£
550. It was also at this time that the Coorparoo
Returned Services League
(RSL) suggested that they take over the Hall and its debts. Solicitor King drew up a new constitution for the two groups and in April 1956, the Minister of Public Lands and Crown Law Office approved the amalgamation and constitution. The Hall was subsequently renamed the Coorparoo School of Arts and RSL Memorial Hall.
[1]
The brick and stucco additions as the front of the Hall were initially rejected at a meeting of the School of Arts committee in December 1951, however, by July 1953, the Trustees' honorary architect,
Eric Percival Trewern
, had drawn up plans and specifications and called for tenders. Builder AA Lock's tender for
£
777 was accepted.
[1]
Coorparoo School of Arts and RSL Memorial Hall continues to be used extensively by the community.
[1]
Description
[
edit
]
Rear of the building, 2015
The Coorparoo School of Arts and RSL Memorial Hall is a single storey timber building, with concrete stumps and a corrugated iron roof, located on the corner of Cavendish Road and Halstead Street, Coorparoo.
[1]
The form of the 1892 Hall is still intact with the main hall to the rear of the building and administration rooms to the front. Later additions and extensions include the building of the verandah in the 1930s, extensions to the eastern, or rear
facade
in 1938, the brick addition to the front façade in the 1950s and the strong room extension to the southern façade.
[1]
The Cavendish Road, or western elevation, is symmetrical with projecting porches under separate gabled roofs. Double hung sash windows with window hoods are located along the elevation. Decorative timber
brackets
form part of the window hoods. The 1950s brick extension is centrally located between the two projecting porches. At the top of the brick facade an inscription reads
"Coorparoo School of Arts & R.S.L. Memorial Hall"
. A doorway and two windows are located at the northern end of the western façade. The doorway provides the entrance to the kitchen which forms part of the 1930s verandah extension.
[1]
The masonry strong room is located at the corner of the western and southern elevations. The timber remainder of the southern elevation has narrow windows along the length of the elevation and a doorway located at the eastern end of the building. Located along the roof are two ridge ventilators.
[1]
The rear of the Hall, the eastern elevation, is in two sections. The extensions are in timber with a separate corrugated iron roof. The larger section, now housing the stage, has two windows located high in the façade. The second, smaller section, houses a dressing room and has a window located along the eastern elevation.
[1]
The northern elevation comprises a verandah, built during the 1930s. A set of
stairs
leading to the verandah is located in the eastern end of the elevation. Louvred windows are located along most of the façade with a set of three windows at the western end.
[1]
Further along the western end of the northern elevation, which forms part of the front section of the Hall, are two windows located beneath a
gable
with a decorative timber bargeboard. One comprises a set of two windows with a window hood, and a second set of three double hung sash windows, also with a window hood. The window hood which covers the set of three windows includes decorative timber brackets.
[1]
Internally, the front foyer opens to two rooms on the northern and southern sides. A vent with decorative fretwork is located in the room at its southern end. The strong room is accessed from this room.
[1]
Paired timber doors with a breezeway open to a small hall. The timber within the doors' framework has been angled to create an decorative effect. The Hall's street numbers 208 and 210, are located on small oval metal plates on the
architrave
. Female and male toilets are located to the northern and southern ends of the Hall. The toilets, installed in the 1950s, have terrazzo floors and skylights.
[1]
Paired, panelled timber doors, with a breezeway, lead to the main hall. The main hall has a timber floor and the raised stage is located at the eastern end of the room. The stage is accessed via a set of timber stairs. Timber vents with decorative fretwork are located along the length of the ceiling. The central section of the timber ceiling is flat and the sides and ends are angled. Two doors, leading to the verandah, are located in the northern elevation. Three narrow windows are located along the northern elevation.
[1]
Also located along the northern elevation is the Coorparoo Roll of Honour and the first telephone in the district. The Honour Board is a copper board mounted on a timber base. Names are applied on individual brass strips. The Board displays ornament relief such as scrolls, flowers and cannons. The wooden telephone is framed within a timber box with glass front.
[1]
The verandah, or northern elevation houses kitchen facilities at the western end and a small storage area, with a doorway to another smaller room, is located at the eastern end. From the storage area some evidence of window infill is located. The window still exists but has been boarded up at some stage.
[1]
The property is surrounded by a low wire fence and a car park is situated at the rear of the building. A picket fence is located at the base of the building at the corner of the western and northern elevations.

Ligue Féminine d'Action Sociale
was a women's organization in Haiti, founded in 1934.
[1]
[2]
It was founded by the leading suffragist
Yvonne Sylvain
in 1934. It was the first feminist organization in Haiti, and played an important role for the struggle for women's suffrage, which was finally introduced in 1950.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
Against this backdrop of ongoing women's opposition to the
US military occupation of Haiti
(1915-1934)
Alice Garoute
was among the founders in 1934 of the Ligue Féminine d'Action Sociale (aka
Feminine League for Social Action
) and its president starting in 1941. She made several impassioned and well-documented speeches in the National Assembly for full equality for women buttressing her arguments with the various conventions signed by Haiti in support of women's rights.
[3]
Besides Alice Garoute, the League's founding members included:
Madeleine Sylvain
,
Fernande Bellegarde
,
Thérèse Hudicourt
,
Esther Dartigue
,
Alice Téligny Mathon
,
Marie-Thérèse Colimon
,
Marie-Thérèse Poitevien
and
Yvonne Hakim-Rimpel
, many of whom were teachers of elite social extraction.  In April 1935, Esther Dartigue was asked by the League to give a talk on the education of women in Haiti, held at the Centre d'Etudes Universitaires, and stated that unfortunately the women were poorly educated. (Only 3% of girls in rural districts attended school and many of those subsequently dropped out, and until 1944 there were no secondary schools for girls in urban areas.)  The talk caused a sensation and was heavily covered by the nation's newspapers.
The league's goals were supported by the political left and included: more schools for girls, equality for women in family law, equal pay for equal work, voting rights for women, free labor unions and a labor ministry with a women's bureau. The League was banned by the government sometime after its founding but was reestablished when it agreed to study its goals instead of immediately implementing them. The league is credited for successfully campaigning for women's voting rights which were finally granted in 1957.
[4]
The First Congress of Haitian Women
[
edit
]
The First Congress of Haitian women was organized by the League on April 10-14, 1950 under the watchful eye of its honorary president,  First Lady
Lucienne Heurtelou
Estimé. Alice Garoute offered a particularly impassioned address about the state of education of Haitian women during which she argued that those women who had been schooled since 1940 in the three private schools that accepted them had done as well as men. She also deplored that women in Haiti during her time were treated as poorly as during
Napoleon
's
Code Noir
(aka Napoleon's Black Code): "like children and the mentally ill".   At the Congress' closing ceremony Alice Garoute and other notable women lodged an official list of their demands.

, who suggested the storyline to Kumar when Kom was not a familiar name in India despite her
numerous achievements
. Kumar met Kom to ask her permission for the film, before her bronze medal victory at the
2012 Summer Olympics
, which brought her recognition. Chopra underwent extensive physical training for four months to attain a muscular physique and learned the sport and Kom's distinct boxing style.
Principal photography
started in June 2013 at
Filmistan
, where the boxing sequences were filmed. After plans to shoot in Kom's hometown,
Manipur
, were dropped due to safety concerns,
Mary Kom
was shot in
Dharamshala
and
Manali
, where a major portion of Manipur was recreated.
The film premiered at the
2014 Toronto International Film Festival
, becoming the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the festival. Made on a budget of
₹
38 crore
(US$4.8 million),
Mary Kom
was released on 5 September 2014 to generally positive reviews with praise for Chopra's performance. Upon its release, the film recorded the highest opening weekend of all time for a
female-led
Indian film. The film was a box office success, grossing
₹
86.19 crore
(US$11 million) at the box office.
Mary Kom
is also ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films led by a female actor.
Mary Kom
received
several accolades
at award ceremonies across India. The film won the
National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment
and was nominated for
Filmfare Award for Best Film
and
Best Actress
for Chopra. Additionally, Chopra won the
Screen Award
and the
Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role
.
Plot
[
edit
]
A young
Mangte Chungeijang Kom
, daughter of a rice farmer from
Imphal
, finds a boxing glove in the remains of an
air crash in 1991
in Kangathei. Kom is fascinated by the glove and grows up taking a keen interest in boxing, despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach of the gym, Narjit Singh, was also the coach of the Asian champion
Dingko Singh
, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass, but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom.
Kom challenges a local wrestler for money, in order to get a household cow back, which the family had to sell off because of their financial troubles. This is where she meets the footballer Onler Kom. After winning the state-level championship, her father confronts her for keeping her involvement in the sport from him. When her father asks her to choose between him and boxing, she reluctantly chooses the sport. After watching her victorious
2002 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships
match on television, her father reconciles with Kom, and apologises to her for not understanding her passion for the sport. Meanwhile, Onler proposes to her and agrees never to ask her to quit boxing. After she wins the
2006 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships
, Kom agrees to marry him, much to her coach's dissatisfaction. After the marriage, Kom gets pregnant and gives up her career to look after her family.
Kom gives birth to twins and applies for a government job. However, she refuses the position of a police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.
Kom then convinces Narjit Singh to train her, as she thinks that he is the one who can get the best out of her. After completing her training, she participates in the
2008 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships
and reaches the finals. Meanwhile, Onler informs her about one of her children having
ventricular septal defect
. In the subsequent fight, Kom fails to defend herself. After a knockout punch from her opponent, Kom hallucinates about her husband and children in the audience. She regains her strength and fights back, winning the championship. On the podium, while accepting the medal, she learns that her son's surgery was successful. Later, she is given the nickname "Magnificent Mary", with the Indian flag waving and the
Indian national anthem
playing in the background.

Development
[
edit
]
Mary Kom was hailed as a National hero after the Olympic win, which also highlighted her previous achievements
During his work as an
art director
on
Sanjay Leela Bhansali
's
Saawariya
(2007),
Omung Kumar
started writing two scripts simultaneously for his directorial debut. However, none of the films were made.
[4]
He then asked writer
Saiwyn Quadras
to look for a female biographical subject for his first film, specifying "a role that no actress would turn down."
[5]
He added that he "wanted to make a film that would be like the
Mother India
of someone's career." Historical personalities such as
Rani Laxmi Bai
and
Queen Elizabeth I of England
came up for discussion; however they did not inspire Kumar.
[5]
Quadras put forward the name of five-time world boxing champion
Mary Kom
, who despite
numerous achievements
, was at that time an unfamiliar name in India. Kumar admitted that he felt disgusted after being told of Kom's achievements as he was unaware of her existence. Quadras later approached Kumar with the script for
Mary Kom
, and he decided to make his directorial debut with it.
[5]
[6]
Quadras, who was interested in sports, started writing the screenplay for the film in 2011, which took two years to complete.
[6]
Quadras arranged a meeting with Kom via her manager in the year he started writing the script.
[6]
Kumar went to
Manipur
to meet Kom and seek her permission to make the film. Initially, Kom was surprised by the development as the sport, especially women's boxing, was not well known in India. However, she was enthusiastic about the idea.
[7]
When Omung came to me I was a five-time World Amateur Boxing champion. I was surprised why he would want to make a movie on me and thought he was joking or gone mad! Boxing, especially in the women's section, is not so well known in India as it's hardly reported, and no one recognized me as Mary Kom.
- Mary Kom, on the development of the film.
[7]
Research for the film was done through available sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos played a key role in the research.
[6]
The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay.
[6]
However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not
documentary
-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break.
[6]
Karan Singh Rathore
Ramendra Vashishth wrote the dialogues.
[3]
The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her
fifth World Boxing Championship win
and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract for the film was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.
[8]
Nevertheless, the film took several cinematic liberties for dramatic effects.
[8]
In a 2012 meeting with Bhansali, Kumar told him about the film; he explained that this was a kind of cinema contrary to Bhansali's signature work. Still, Bhansali wanted to hear the story and was also enthusiastic towards the project. After hearing the script, he liked it and immediately agreed to produce the film.
[5]
[9]
Viacom18 Motion Pictures
and Bhansali, Under his production company
Bhansali Productions
came together to produce the film.
[3]
However, Kumar's colleagues were not sure if a film based in Manipur would be well received by the audience.
[4]
This concern evaporated after the
2012 Summer Olympics
, where Kom
won a bronze medal
. Her win also highlighted her previous achievements.
[4]
[10]
After the news of the development of the film broke in the media, the makers clarified that the film was in development since 2011, much before the Olympics, and they were not influenced by her recent success.
[11]
[12]
In an interview with
Press Trust of India
, Bhansali described the film as a "rare experiment", for the fact that "Not many films are based on biopics of living people" and expressed his pride about his association with the project, adding that the story was so inspiring, it touched his heart.
[10]
Casting and characters
[
edit
]
Chopra was Kumar's and Bhansali's first choice for the title role.
[5]
[13]
In early November 2012, media reports suggested that Chopra entered negotiations to star in the film, which she denied initially.
[13]
Later in that month, it was confirmed that she had been cast for the part.
[14]
She was initially skeptical about the film due to the demanding nature of the character, which included training, muscle building, and learning the sport. She later agreed to the film because of Kumar's confidence in her.
[4]
The decision to cast Chopra proved controversial as some believed that an actress from Northeast India bearing Kom's likeness would be better suited for the role.
[4]
[5]
The director however felt that the film needed a big star with a wider reach and casting an unknown actress from that region would reduce the film's scope and lessen its reach, thus defeating his purpose of telling Kom's story to a larger audience.
[4]
[5]
Emphasizing Chopra's bankability and reach among the audiences Kumar remarked,  "I not only needed a capable actress but also someone who can connect with millions of viewers".
[4]
[5]
Mary Kom defended Chopra's casting and thought of Chopra as the "perfect choice" for the role.
[13]
[15]
In an interview with
Daily News and Analysis
, Kom described Chopra as the best actress to play the role, adding that her body was well structured, like that of a boxer.
[7]
In contrast, it took the casting directors Shruti Mahajan and Paragg Mehta several months of auditions to finalise the appropriate supporting actors for the film.
[5]
In May 2013, a wide section of the media reported that
Danny Denzongpa
was approached to play Kom's coach Narjit Singh in the film.
[16]
Instead, Sunil Thapa was cast for the role of Kom's coach.
[17]
Darshan Kumar was finalised as Kom's husband, footballer Onler Kom, after a series of auditions which included three different looks representing three different stages in his life.
[18]
[19]
Robin Das, a
National School of Drama
professor, was cast in the role of Kom's father.
[17]
Kom and Chopra at the music release of the film
Before filming began, Chopra prepared for three months. The preparations included building the physique of a boxer and learning the sport.
[20]
Samir Jaura was brought in to train Chopra.
[21]
At that time, she was busy dubbing for
Krrish 3
(2013), and filming for
Gunday
(2014).
[21]
It was then decided that Jaura would accompany her to film shoots, so that continuity in training could be maintained.
[21]
Though he did not get a chance to meet Kom, he used her videos to study her body language and prepare a workout plan for Chopra,
[17]
who started training in April 2013.
[22]
[23]
She found it hard to train vigorously to attain a boxer's physique. She was put on a low-carb, high-protein diet.
[17]
"As a girl it was very difficult to build those muscles. I had to build in three months what Mary did in 15 years", she said in an interview with
Deccan Chronicle
.
[22]
Chopra got a fifteen-day break from her other commitments to train for the film. She relocated to her bungalow in
Goa
, where she would train for five hours a day.
[21]
After completing workouts, which included weights and circuit training, she insisted on training for boxing. Later, boxing was made a part of her daily workout.
[21]
She was trained by Kom's coaches to learn her distinct boxing style.
[20]
Chopra explained that she did not have to act like a boxer, but had to become one and said, "To learn boxing was a religion. Today, I can play the sport as I know the rules, body posture, foot work, I can hit, I can defend. I know the game."
[24]
Chopra found
Mary Kom
a very special and personal film due to the inspiring story, adding that she pushed herself to do justice to the role. She revealed that she channeled the grief of her father's death into the film: "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it."
[25]
[26]
In an interview with
Daily News and Analysis
, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she did not try to imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality.
[24]
In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of
Manipur
to learn more about her life.
[27]
As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her.
[22]
Kom stated, "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family - basically she got to know aspects of my family life."
[28]
To get Kom's Hindi and Manipuri accents right, Chopra listened to the taped conversations of the boxer.
[29]
Darshan Kumar described his character as an "encouraging husband", who is the pillar of strength in Kom's life.
[30]
He found the character challenging due to contrasting personalities. Unlike Chopra, Kumar did not meet Onler Kom before the film. He mainly made use of the videos which Kom had provided to the makers, which helped him understand the nuances of his character. For the role, he had to learn the Manipuri accent, which was difficult for him being a Haryanvi.
[31]
Kumar lost 12 kilogram to look the part, and followed a strict, grilled chicken and oil-free fish protein diet for three months.
[19]
Pre-production
[
edit
]
The
production design
was handled by Kumar's wife, Vanita. After plans to shoot in Manipur were dropped because of safety concerns, extensive research was done to find locations similar to Manipur.
[17]
[32]
Their search ended in
Himachal Pradesh
,
Manali
, where a major portion of the state was recreated.
[32]
Vanita used a real structure instead of a set to show Kom's childhood home in Kangathei. She recreated the look and feel of Manipur in
Dharamshala
and Manali.
[17]
During the search, Vanita found two houses that were similar to those where Kom spent her childhood and lived after her marriage.
[4]
For authenticity, the house was filled with items similar to those found at Kom's house, such as indigenous short stools and woven curtains sourced from Manipur.
[17]
Since Kom has a separate trophy room where all her awards are kept, a similar room was created. Quotes from the
Bible
were added on the walls. A 19th-century church in Dharamshala was chosen for the wedding sequence.
[4]
Vanita noted that "the cinematic realism, was a different experience from the grandeur of Bhansali's sets." However, she found it difficult to recreate the run-down gym where Kom was trained. A place was chosen with minimal facilities and water leaking onto the walls. She revealed that the sets had to feel authentic rather than artificially created.
[4]
The costumes were designed by Isha Mantry and Rajat Tangri.
[3]
Tangri visited Manipur to study fabric used in local clothing. Tangri used photographs from Kom's childhood to create clothing which ranged from traditional to sporty and athletic attires.
[17]
For Kom's wedding sequence in the film, Tangri created an exact replica of her wedding gown.
[33]
Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, they wanted her to look exactly like Kom by using
prosthetic makeup
.
[34]
Chopra did a prosthetic test in the United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during the filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes.
[34]
It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using
visual effects
.
[34]
However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped.
[35]
Chopra said "We tried a bunch of stuff - Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [but] it looked too gimmicky. That's when we decided to go with just carrying the essence of the film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part."
[35]
Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since
Agneepath
(2012), was hired.
[17]
For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required a lot of time and detailing.
[36]
He stated, "Every punch or scar needed to look real, change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup." He did some research by visiting hospitals to understand more about skin injuries.
[36]
Rohit Kulkarni composed the background score.
[3]
Filming
[
edit
]
The film was extensively shot in Manali
Principal photography
began on 17 June 2013 at
Filmistan
,
Mumbai
.
[37]
The media reports suggested that, with sets ready and Chopra already training, the filming was supposed to start earlier at Filmistan, but following actress' father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold for a while.
[37]
Bhansali had told Chopra that the filming could wait and to take some time off in the wake of her father's loss; however, the actress insisted on starting the filming immediately.
[37]
Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara used a hand-held camera during the shooting of the film.
[38]
Sports coordinator Robert Miller was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.
[17]
Miller roped in Christy Halbert, the United States's assistant coach at the London Olympics, to help choreograph the fight scenes.
[17]
To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes.
[4]
Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised that it would not be feasible and would be time-consuming.
[39]
They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes were difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, "They are real boxers, and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard."
[40]
The second schedule commenced in Manali in late March 2014, after Chopra finished her other film commitments.
[4]
[41]
Before filming, Chopra had to re-train herself to build muscles.
[4]
Bhansali planned an elaborate, over-a-month-long schedule for her, which ensured that her physicality and agility were suitable enough for the role.
[42]
While filming a sequence in a marketplace, more than ten thousand people gathered on the sets. Due to limited security arrangements, the crowds became uncontrollable in what was not believed to be a heavily populated area. When Chopra stepped out of her van, some fans tried to approach her, causing the general loss of control. As a result, the shoot was cancelled and the whole crew had to leave.
[43]
Filming in Manali continued till early April 2014, before shifting to Dharamshala.
[44]
While filming fight sequence in Dharamshala, Chopra suffered an eye injury, which the makeup team exaggerated for effect.
[45]
The filming in Dharamshala continued till 19 April 2014.
[46]
The filming was done in 57 days over the course of two years.
[17]
Rajesh G. Pandey edited the film with Bhansali.

CEO of Viacom 18 Motion Pictures Ajit Andhare, Bhansali, Chopra, and Kumar at the trailer launch of
Mary Kom
Mary Kom
was one of the highly anticipated films of 2014.
[5]
[24]
The first poster for the film was revealed on 14 July 2014 by Chopra through her
Twitter
account.
[56]
[57]
It portrayed a muscular Chopra as Mary Kom in sports clothing, with her hair tied in a pony tail, punching a bag.
[58]
[59]
It received positive feedback from film critics, industry professionals, and audiences alike.
[60]
[61]
Sweta Kaushal of
Hindustan Times
noted that "with well-built muscles and a completely toned body, Priyanka looks fierce."
[62]
[63]
The poster went viral on social media, with the hashtag "#MaryKomFirstLook" trending in India and worldwide.
[64]
The following day, Chopra tweeted another poster for the film; a motion poster was released on the same day.
[65]
[66]
The first teaser with the tagline "Most Champions Make Their Name. She Made History" was released on Chopra's birthday (18 July).
[67]
[68]
With the interest generated by these reveals, the trailer release was highly anticipated, with media reporting that it would be unveiled on 24 July.
[69]
However, it was released the day before at an event on 23 July and generated interest in the audience, media and critics.
[70]
[71]
[72]
On 27 August, a special screening was held for selected members of media, trade and critics, where 20 minutes of raw footage from the film was previewed, creating a positive buzz.
[73]
Mary Kom herself (along with her husband) attended few promotional events of the film. As part of their promotional strategy, Bhansali Productions released a doll, which looked like Chopra as Kom.
[74]
[75]
The film was originally scheduled for release on 2 October (on
Gandhi Jayanti
),
[76]
however, it was announced that the film was postponed to an uncertain date to revamp the film to feature more events surrounding Kom's life.
[77]
After the uncertainty of a release date for a month, it was announced that the film would be released on 5 September (
Teacher's Day
), clashing with
Daawat-e-Ishq
, which starred Chopra's cousin,
Parineeti
.
[78]
Yash Raj Films
requested that Bhansali shift the release date, which he refused due to previous release date changes of the film and the ongoing promotional activities. Later, Yash Raj Films postponed the
Daawat-e-Ishq
release date by two weeks.
[79]
On 4 September,
Mary Kom
had its world premiere at the
2014 Toronto International Film Festival
, where it became the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the film festival.
[80]
[81]
It was released in 1500 screens worldwide.
[82]
The film was released in overseas markets by
Eros International
as part of a four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel
Colors
.
[83]
The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000.
[84]
In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state would not be able to see her biopic.
[84]
However, unauthorised
DVDs
and
VCDs
flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.
[85]
Made on a budget of
₹
180 million including production, prints and advertising, and marketing,
Mary Kom
earned
₹
200 million, and before release recouped more than its cost from brand tie-ups.
[86]
[83]
The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged in a way that the products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising.
[87]
The satellite rights of the film were sold for
₹
140 million and music rights for
₹
30 million.
[88]
[86]
The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in
NTSC
format.
[89]
Distributed by
Shemaroo Entertainment
, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes.
[90]
The VCD and
Blu-ray
versions were released at the same time.
[91]
[92]
The
Mary Kom
Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a
Dolby Atmos
soundtrack.

Reception

Critical reception
[

Chopra received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Mary Kom
The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Chopra receiving critical acclaim for her performance.
[93]
[94]
Subhash K. Jha
awarded the film 5 stars out of 5, describing it as "a motivational masterpiece" and said "From first frame to last it grips your senses and irrigates the parched corridors of your heart like very few bio-pics in recent times. [...] a work that is as dramatic as Mehboob's
Mother India
and as inspiring as Attenborough's
Gandhi
."
[95]
Jha lauded Chopra's transformation into Kom and noted her for expressing every shade of the character with a "pitch-perfect" bravado.
[95]
Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5, noting it as a victory for its protagonist Chopra, scriptwriter Saiwyn Quadras, and director Omung Kumar and wrote "Mary's story is delivered with a sincerity that makes it irresistible."
[96]
Sonia Chopra from
Sify
described the film as a "thrilling ringside view", saying that "Mary Kom is an important film that's hugely inspiring. But more importantly, it's also great fun to watch."
[97]
The reviewer singled out Chopra's performance, writing "Priyanka Chopra, transformed into Mary Kom, to give us this year's most earnest, memorable performance thus far!"
[97]
The Times of India
gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 calling it as Bollywood's answer to
Academy Award
-winning film
Million Dollar Baby
(2004).
[98]
Bollywood Hungama
gave it 4 stars, stating that the film "will surely go down in the history of exemplary biopics on Indian celluloid."
[99]
The review noted the technical aspects of the film such as the cinematography, costumes, background score which "overshadowed" the film's soundtrack and the "crisp" editing.
[99]
Namrata Joshi
from
Outlook
rated the film with 3 stars out of 4 and commented on the simple, unpretentious storyline that dramatised important events from the champion's life, complimenting Chopra's "sincere and earnest" performance.
[100]
The Economic Times
gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5, noting that the film is well on its way to being one of the most praised sports-based films since
Chak De India
and
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag
and wrote "This is one of those boxing movies which is much more than boxing. It takes you to a place which is beyond ruptured cheeks, cracked jaws, and fractured ribs of the protagonist."
[101]
Writing for
Hindustan Times
,
Anupama Chopra
rated the film 3 out of 5, noting it as a "worthy attempt", saying that the film had sincerity and was crafted with care, but criticised the screenplay which she thought was limited to "ticking off milestones" of Kom's career.
[102]
She felt that the film was powered by Chopra's "remarkable" performance.
[102]
Mayank Shekhar
also rated the film with 3 stars, stating that his biggest concern before getting into the film was that the film-makers (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) would excessively "Bollywood-ise" Kom's story. He commented that this fear was "thankfully" not found.
[103]
Rajeev Masand
remarked that the film was "perfectly watchable, but never great like it should've been", criticising the "bland" script and wrote, "the film ticks off each of Mary Kom's career achievements and key personal struggles, but doesn't tell you much more about her as a person."
[104]
Masand was impressed by Chopra's performance noting that the actress "transforms herself physically, and also skillfully conveys both the rage and vulnerability that the part required."
[104]
Sudhish Kamath
from
The Hindu
thought that the script was generic and predictable, and the plot was actually manipulative.
[105]
However, Kamath felt that the film should be watched for Chopra who gave a "knockout" performance, writing "The spirited actress rises above the material and makes us invest in her. She owns the film and does full justice to the spirit of the world champion, making all that criticism about her casting irrelevant."
[105]
On the contrary,
Business Standard
criticised the film for not showing enough about boxing in general rather than Kom in particular. It stated that "while Mary Kom is entertaining, it should have aspired to be more."
[106]
Shubhra Gupta from
The Indian Express
gave a rating of 2.5, noting that the "Film gets bloated by extraneous songs", and criticised the product placements calling them a "distraction from the story."
[107]
The
India Today
reviewer, Rohit Khilnani, criticised Kumar's direction and wrote "The story is predictable from the word go and there are absolutely no surprise elements. A lot could have been done with such a strong protagonist, but the director doesn't experiment."
[108]
Concerning the controversy over Chopra being cast as Kom, a number of critics including
Lin Laishram
and
Adil Hussain
opined that it was a missed opportunity in showcasing a Northeast Indian actress in a lead role, given the lack of actors and actresses from the region in mainstream Hindi films.
[109]
[110]
[111]
[112]
[113]
[114]
Rashmi Sawhney noted, "It is telling that there is not one actor from any of the North-Eastern states who has gained firm foothold in the Bombay film industry — the Sikkimese-Bhutia actor,
Danny Denzongpa
was possibly the lone exception, and the Nepali
Manisha Koirala
was as close as Hindi cinema got to romancing ‘slit eyes’."
[115]
Adding to Sawhney's observations, Manipuri actor
Bijou Thaangjam
remarked that opportunities for actors and actresses of the region are often restricted to inconsequential
token roles
, many of which consist of little more than stereotypes or caricatures.
[116]
Chopra later addressed the casting decision in 2022, and agreed that the role should have gone to a Northeast Indian actress.

The
1984 Dutch Grand Prix
was a
Formula One
motor race
held at
Zandvoort
on 26 August 1984. It was the thirteenth race of the
1984 Formula One World Championship
.
The 71-lap race was won by Frenchman
Alain Prost
, driving a
McLaren

TAG
, after he started from
pole position
. Brazilian
Nelson Piquet
led the first ten laps in his
Brabham
-

before his oil pressure failed, after which Prost led the remainder of the race. His Austrian teammate
Niki Lauda
finished second, with Briton
Nigel Mansell
third in a
Lotus
-
Renault
. The 1-2 finish secured the Constructors' Championship for McLaren, their first since
1974
.
Before the race, it was rumoured that
Ayrton Senna
would break his contract with the
Toleman
team and join Lotus for
1985
. When this move was announced two days after the race, Toleman management were angered as Senna had not informed them of his intentions, and as a result they suspended him from the next race in
Italy
. It was also correctly rumoured that, with
Jacques Laffite
already known to be leaving
Williams
at the end of the season to return to
Ligier
, team owner
Frank Williams
had signed Mansell for 1985 alongside
Keke Rosberg

Alex Thomas O'Reilly
(born 5 September 1979) is a former professional
footballer
who played as a
goalkeeper
in
the Football League
for
Northampton Town
. Born in England, he represented the Republic of Ireland internationally at youth levels U19 and U21.
Career
[
edit
]
Alex's footballing career began as a trainee with
West Ham United
, where he became a professional in 1997. After being with the Hammers for two years, in which he had failed to make a first team appearance, he went out on loan to
Northampton Town
at the start of the 1999-2000 season. He played three times during his first loan spell, playing twice in the league and once in the League Cup. He returned to West Ham towards the end of August 1999, but made enough impact with the Cobblers for them to take O'Reilly for a second loan spell in October 1999 where he made six appearances. After returning to the Hammers again, he made a brief loan move to
Wigan Athletic
in November 2000, where he didn't appear in the first team, before being given permission to leave West Ham on a free transfer to join
Bristol Rovers
on a monthly basis in March 2001.
[

]
After being released by Rovers in 2001, O'Reilly joined
Purfleet
, where he stayed for two years. In 2003, he signed for
Gravesend & Northfleet
,
[1]
before moving to
Fisher Athletic
. He joined Stevenage Borough at the start of the 2004-05 season, but his stay was short-lived and he moved to
Dagenham & Redbridge
early during the campaign. For much of the 2004-05 season, he was then loaned out to
Redbridge
by the Daggers.
[
citation needed
]
He signed for
Athlone Town
in March 2009.
[2]
Personal life
[
edit
]
In July 2017 O'Reilly graduated from the
University of Salford
with a degree in physiotherapy as part of a scheme between the university and the
Professional Footballers Association
aimed at preparing current and former footballers for careers after football.

[1]
Jussi 69 then asked
Reckless Love
frontman
Olli Herman
to join, and the initial line-up was rounded out by
Santa Cruz
's Archie Cruz.
[1]
Dubbed "The Local Band", the group played their first show in December 2013 at the
Tavastia Club
in
Helsinki
, which was sold-out.
[2]
The band then played at the

Diagram displaying consolidation of ITV franchisees into ITV plc
ITV plc was the result of a merger between
Granada
and
Carlton
following the various mergers between the companies of the
ITV
network that had taken place from 1993 when the ownership rules were relaxed.
[2]
The first wave of mergers began with
Yorkshire Television
acquiring
Tyne Tees Television
in 1992, forming a parent group called
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television
Holdings.
[3]
In 1994,
Carlton Communications
- which had owned a 20% stake in
Central Independent Television
- acquired the remainder of the company
[3]
and, because of Central's shareholdings, inherited a 20% stake in
Meridian Broadcasting
. Later that year, Granada acquired
London Weekend Television
[3]
through a hostile takeover worth in the region of £750 million. MAI, which controlled
Meridian Broadcasting
, acquired
Anglia Television
;
[3]
MAI became United News & Media after merging with United Newspapers - owners of
The
Daily Express
in 1996.
[3]
Ownership rules, that previously restricted ownership of ITV licences by one company to two outright, plus 20% in a third, were relaxed, and so Carlton went on to acquire
Westcountry Television
[3]
(later re-branding it Carlton, along with Central), Granada acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Holdings
[3]
(with the parent group becoming Granada Media, later simply Granada) and United acquired
HTV
.
[3]
The idiosyncrasies and business model of the future ITV plc operation can be found in the way these new conglomerates operated their franchises. Carlton re-branded all of its stations with its own name, creating a single identity across the whole expanse of its territory. By contrast, Granada and United, while keeping the franchisees' names, centralised their continuity departments - Granada in
Leeds
and United in
Southampton
. All three, however, merged the network production operations of their franchises, creating Carlton Productions, Granada Content and United Productions.
[4]
By the end of the 1990s, there were three dominating owners of the ITV franchises in England and Wales:
Carlton Communications
,
Granada plc
and
United News and Media
. In 2000, after an aborted merger attempt with Carlton, UNM decided to leave ITV and Granada bought all the UNM franchises,
[3]
but sold HTV to Carlton in order to comply with the permitted audience percentage covered by a single broadcasting interest.
[5]
It kept the production arm of
HTV
, however, renaming it Granada Bristol and moving it out of Bath Road to a new, smaller office in Whiteladies Road (near the
BBC
). This arm of the company closed in 2006, following later rationalisation of ITV's production operations. The last remaining independent ITV franchise in
England and Wales
,
Border Television
, had been bought by Capital Group in 2000, and was sold on to Granada in 2001,
[6]
with Border's radio assets being retained by
Capital Radio plc
.
[7]
The merger
[
edit
]
Logo used from 2 February 2004 to 15 January 2006
In 2004, Granada and Carlton merged to become ITV plc, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales.
[8]
One of the consequences of the merger was (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to make cost savings, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. Among the casualties were network production and studio facilities of Tyne Tees in
Newcastle upon Tyne
, Meridian in Southampton, Central in
Nottingham
and Anglia in
Norwich
. In all cases, ITV moved the regional franchisee to a new location complete with hi-tech facilities for news production, but with a minimal number of (physically smaller) studios and the loss of many jobs. Tyne Tees' factual department merged with Yorkshire's in
Leeds
(which has since closed and re-emerged as Shiver Productions);
[9]
Meridian's factual and sport production moved to London; all network production in
Nottingham
was re-allocated to London,
Manchester
or
Leeds
(and the local
Central News
studio moved to
Birmingham
), and Anglia Factual, reduced to a satellite operation of
ITV Studios
and primarily producing output for the international market or occasionally third parties in the UK, was eventually closed in January 2012.
[10]
Post-merger
[
edit
]
Prior to the merger, and despite being rivals within ITV, Granada and Carlton had already been involved in several joint ventures, including the digital terrestrial television operator
ITV Digital
that went bankrupt, and collapsed in 2002.
[11]
They also owned the digital channel
ITV2
, which had launched in December 1998, and 65% of the (re-branded)
ITV News Channel
, previously owned by ITN and was originally launched as the ITN News Channel. As well as consolidating its (now 40%) shareholding in ITN itself, the newly merged company was able to buy the final 35% stake in the ITV News Channel from ITN's original partners
NTL
in April 2004.
[12]
In November the same year, and following a frantic last-minute deal with
BSkyB
to buy its half of the
Granada Sky Broadcasting
joint venture, they launched the digital channel
ITV3
, replacing
Granada Plus
which ITV plc closed down on satellite and cable. A year later they launched
ITV4
. However, due to multiplex issues (and the fact that it was losing money) the ITV News Channel controversially had its hours on
Freeview
reduced, and was finally closed down on 23 December 2005, with its Freeview space being taken over by replacements
ITV4
and
CITV
, which launched in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively.
[13]
On 27 April 2005, ITV plc bought
SDN
, the
digital terrestrial
franchise holder of Multiplex A (now transmitting ten channels) from its shareholders,
S4C
and
UBM
for £134 million.
[14]
In April 2006, the participation channel
ITV Play
was launched. It was also an overnight block on ITV1. Following a series of scandals surrounding participation TV, the dedicated ITV Play channel was closed down in March 2007, followed by the late-night phone-in quiz shows on the ITV Network in December 2007, however the brand continued to be used for a time for part of the gaming section of
itv.com
.
[15]
In August 2006, the company sold its 45% shareholding in
TV3 Ireland
, which had been bought by Granada in 2001, to
Doughty Hanson & Co
.
[16]
Reorganisation
[
edit
]
Logo used from 16 January 2006 to 13 January 2013
There were rumours of take-over and merger bids during 2006.  For example, on 9 November 2006,
NTL
announced that it had approached ITV plc about a proposed merger.
[17]
[18]
The merger was effectively blocked by
British Sky Broadcasting
on 17 November 2006 when it bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc for £940 million,
[19]
a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder
Richard Branson
[20]
and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator
Ofcom
.
[21]
On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the
Office of Fair Trading
about BSkyB's move. NTL stated that it had withdrawn its attempt to buy ITV plc, citing that it did not believe that there was any possibility to make a deal on favourable terms.
[22]
At the same time as the NTL bid,
RTL
, the then-owner of
Channel 5
, was also rumoured to be preparing a bid for ITV plc, with the possibility of a stock-swap with BSkyB; the plan would have seen RTL acquiring BSkyB's stake in ITV plc (with the aim of further acquisitions of shares in the future) in exchange for BSkyB taking full control of Channel 5.
[23]
In the end, no movement was made on this possible deal and RTL sold Channel 5 to Richard Desmond's
Northern & Shell
Network in July 2010.
[24]
The company then entered into a series of disposals of non-core activities: in March 2009 the company sold its investment in
Friends Reunited
(a website dedicated to reunited former school friends or colleagues in a number of countries) which it had acquired in December 2005.
[25]
Also in May 2009 the company sold Carlton Screen Advertising (the largest cinema advertising business in the
Republic of Ireland
and
Northern Ireland
and now known as
Wide Eye Media
).
[26]
In 2010, a large-scale business reorganisation, called the "five-year Transformation Plan" was launched. Thanks to stringent
working capital
management and cost management some of the set goals were already achieved in 2012. These include a ranking upgrade (from BB- to BB+), an increase in
audience share
and reduction of debt (from net debt of £730 million at the end of 2008, to a positive net cash position of £16 million at the end of the first quarter 2012).
[27]
In December 2013 the company sold its remaining shareholding in
STV Group plc
(owner of the
Scottish
and
Grampian
ITV franchises) which had been bought by Carlton in 1999.
[28]
On 17 July 2014, BSkyB's 6.4% stake in ITV was sold to
Liberty Global
, valued at £481 million.
[29]
On 19 August 2015, ITV purchased
UTV
for £100m ensuring that 13 out of the 15 licences (it does not hold the two in Scotland) were in its control.
[30]
In July 2016 the company sold
UTV Ireland
to
Virgin Media
.
[31]
In August 2016, it was revealed that ITV had made an offer to acquire Canadian multinational film and television distributor
Entertainment One
for around £1 billion. On 10 August 2016, it was announced that eOne had rejected the offer, considering it to be "fundamentally undervalued".
[32]
In 2017, it was announced that ITV plc had acquired a majority stake in British Production company
World Productions
, behind the hit BBC series
Line of Duty
. As a result of the deal, World Productions is now part of ITV Studios.
[33]
[34]
In 2022, the company announced the arrival of ITVX, which it said would be Britain's first integrated advertising and subscription funded streaming platform, and would compliment its catch-up service, ITV Hub, and would include access to BritBox.
[35]
[36]
On 1 June 2022, it was announced that it will be demoted from the FTSE 100, and became a constituent of the
FTSE 250 Index
on 20 June.

Chemical compound
Lanthanum phosphide
is an
inorganic compound
of
lanthanum
and
phosphorus
with the chemical formula
LaP
.
Synthesis
[
edit
]
Lanthanum phosphide can be made by heating lanthanum metal with excess phosphorus in a vacuum:
[2]
4 La + P

m, cell parameters a = 0.6025 nm, with number of formulas per unit cell Z = 4.
[1]
The crystals are very unstable and decompose in the open air.
Electronic properties
[
edit
]
Lanthanum phosphide is an example of a
strongly correlated material
,
[3]
complicating theoretical prediction of its properties.
According to
HSE06
calculations, lanthanum phosphide has been theoretically predicted to have an indirect band gap of 0.25 eV along the
Γ-X direction
.
[4]
According to HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling, the band gap is predicted to be a direct gap of 0.72 eV at the X point.
[5]
Using EVGGA, the compound is predicted to have a band gap of 0.56 eV along the Γ-X direction.
[6]
FP-LAPW has predicted an indirect gap of 0.33 eV along the Γ-X direction.
[3]
Chemical properties

The
1964 Rose Bowl
was the 50th
Rose Bowl Game
, played on January 1, 1964. It featured the
Illinois Fighting Illini
and the
Washington Huskies
.
[3]
[4]
Illinois was led by co-captains
Dick Butkus
and
George Donnelly
,
Jim Grabowski
,
Lynn Stewart
, and
Archie Sutton
on their way to a
17-7
victory over the Huskies, led by
Junior Coffey
.
[3]
The game was scoreless until the second quarter; Washington scored first, following an Illinois fumble at its own 27-yard line. Backup quarterback, Bill Siler, kept it for three yards, then passed it to Joe Mancuso for 18 yards to the Illini 6. Siler then faked a pass and pitched to halfback
Dave Kopay
, who scored behind the block of halfback
Ron Medved
, with 8:26 left in the first half. The Illini got on the scoreboard with Jim Plankenhorn's field goal in the waning seconds of the second quarter and Washington led
7-3
at halftime.
[5]
In the third quarter, after George Donnelly's first interception of the game, Illinois took control as Jim Warren scored a touchdown for the Illini on a two-yard run.
In the fourth quarter, with Illinois up by a score of 10-7, Washington was driving downfield, trying to score a go-ahead and possible game-winning touchdown, but George Donnelly intercepted the ball on the 4-yard line and ran it back to the 15. Illinois capitalized on that momentum and moved the ball 85 yards, with
Jim Grabowski
scoring his second touchdown of the game to put Illinois ahead 17-7.
Sophomore Grabowski rushed for 125 yards and was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
[3]
Butkus played both ways in this contest, both at center and linebacker. He recovered a fumble, and had an interception (in addition to leading a defense that held Washington to only 59 yards rushing and 71 yards passing for the game).
[6]
Aftermath
[
edit
]
The opposing running backs were both drafted by the
Green Bay Packers
, Coffey in
1965
and Grabowski in
1966

Interjected scene that takes a narrative forward in time
This article is about the narrative device. For other uses, see
Flashforward (disambiguation)
.
A
flashforward
(also spelled
flash-forward
, and more formally known as
prolepsis
) is a scene that temporarily takes the
narrative
forward in time from the current point of the story in literature, film, television and other media.
[1]
Flashforwards are often used to represent events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the
future
. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. It is similar to
foreshadowing
, in which future events are not shown but rather implicitly hinted at. It is also similar to an
ellipsis
, which takes the narrative forward and is intended to skim over boring or uninteresting details, for example the aging of a character. It is primarily a
postmodern
narrative device
, named by analogy to the more traditional
flashback
, which reveals events that occurred in the past.
Literature
[
edit
]
An early example of prolepsis which predates the postmodern period is
Charles Dickens
' 1843 novella
A Christmas Carol
, in which the protagonist
Ebenezer Scrooge
is shown the future following his death. The subsequent events of the story imply that this future will be averted by this foreknowledge.
Terry Brooks
'
Word & Void
series features a
protagonist
who, when he sleeps, moves forward and backward through time to before and after a great cataclysm. This is both
analepsis
and prolepsis.
Muriel Spark
makes extensive use of prolepsis in her 1961 novel
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie
.
In
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, the protagonist
Boruto Uzumaki
faces an enemy named
Kawaki
in a ruined Hidden Leaf Village in the opening scene of the anime and manga series. This is prolepsis.
Television
[
edit
]
Every season of
Damages
makes an extensive use of flashforwards, revealing the outcome of the season to the viewer. The whole season then revolves around discovering the circumstances that led to this outcome. For instance, the first season starts with a flashforward of the protagonist, Ellen Parsons, running in the streets of New York, covered in blood. 6 months earlier, she was only a naive young woman who had just become a lawyer in the firm of a powerful attorney, Patty Hewes. What led Ellen to the situation presented in the flashforwards is revealed little by little throughout the season. The series is known for its misleading use of flashforwards, which are often examples of the
red herring
device.
After making extensive use of flashbacks in the first two seasons, the TV series
Lost
started using flashforwards as well throughout the remainder of the series. The first instance of this was a major plot twist in the
third season finale
: what appeared to be a flashback to before the characters were stranded on the island, was revealed at the end of the two-part episode to be a flashforward of them returned to civilization. A later episode featured what appeared to be flashforwards involving the couple Jin and Sun, showing them safely returned home and awaiting the birth of their baby, but it is then revealed that Jin's scenes were flashbacks and only Sun's were flashforwards (reflecting the fact that they are separated in time and space).
The series finale of
Star Trek: Voyager
, "
Endgame
", uses a technique similar to a flashforward. It depicts a future in which the U.S.S.
Voyager
has returned home after decades lost in deep space with various personal tragedies, prompting the ship's captain to use
time travel
to return to the timeframe of the series and return the crew home more directly.
The American
sci-fi
television series
FlashForward
revolves around everyone on Earth losing consciousness for 137 seconds, during which each person experiences a glimpse of events 6 months in the future.
[2]
The series was itself based loosely on the novel
Flashforward
by
Robert J. Sawyer
.
Flashforwards have been used in British soap operas as well.
Hollyoaks
flashed forward six months in May 2010 for a special episode.
[3]
Hollyoaks
then had a flashforward to New Year's Eve 2020 to see the characters in a year's time. The BBC soap opera
EastEnders
did a scene which flashforward to Christmas 2023 in an episode airing in the February of that year where characters
Linda Carter
,
Suki Panesar
,
Kathy Beale
,
Stacey Slater
,
Denise Fox
and
Sharon Watts
look over the body of a deceased man, who is not revealed to the viewer.
[4]
The last episode of
Six Feet Under
ends with an extensive flashforward depicting the deaths of all the central characters for several decades in the future.
Breaking Bad
uses flashforwards throughout its second season showing a mystery regarding debris and corpses in
Walter White
's house and neighborhood, revealed to be the result of two planes crashing overhead. The first half of the fifth season begins with a flashforward one year into the future where Walter is fifty-two years old, and the second half begins with a continuation of the story, where he returns to his abandoned home. The plot of these flashforwards is resumed in the
series finale
.
Better Call Saul
, a
spin-off
of
Breaking Bad
, follows a trend of starting each season with a flashforward scene, set after the events of
Breaking Bad
(and thus several years in the future relative to the time frame of the events narrated in
Better Call Saul
) and, apart from the flashforward in the
final season premiere
, shot in black and white. These scenes depict
Saul Goodman
's life after
Breaking Bad
as a fugitive of the law, working as a manager of a
Cinnabon
under a new alias. The plot of these flashforwards is resumed in the final four episodes of the series, which are also shot in black and white.
How to Get Away with Murder
used in every episode flashforwards of scenes from future episodes until ninth episode of the first season.
Quantico
used flashforwards in order to unravel the future events that have occurred in the first and second season.
The
Netflix
series
Elite
used flashforwards to unravel the murder mystery of a future event, in the first season.
The Netflix series
Quicksand
used flashforwards to unravel the circumstances leading to a school shooting, in the first season.
The CW
series
Arrow
utilizes flashforwards in its
seventh season
, having previously employed extensive flashbacks for its first five seasons. There are also flashforwards throughout the
fourth season
foreshadowing the character
Laurel Lance's
death.
Film
[
edit
]
Midway through the 1969 film
They Shoot Horses, Don't They?
, there is an abrupt flashforward when Robert, the character played by
Michael Sarrazin
, is seen being thrust into a jail cell by a police officer, even though he has done nothing to provoke such treatment. The audience is notified, later in the story, that Sarrazin's character would have indeed made choices that warrant his arrest.
The 2016 film
Arrival
relies extensively on prolepsis throughout, disguised as flashbacks (like the aforementioned episode of
Lost
). The main character gains precognitive ability after learning the language of the aliens, and proceeds to use it to prevent the outbreak of war. She uses information revealed to her 18 months in the future to convince a military leader not to attack the aliens in the present.
Video games
[
edit
]
In
Until Dawn
(2015), players may find artifacts left by the
Native American
tribe who lived on the mountain that show premonitions of possible future events. Whether they come true is dependent on player actions; for example, one shows another character's death in a scene that can be avoided.

Airing history
[
edit
]
As an afternoon newscast
[
edit
]
The newscast premiered on July 13, 1998, a year after the cancellation of
Headline Trese
in 1997. It was first anchored by Anne Marie Soriano and Alice Noel. In July 1999, Noel was replaced by Ida Marie Bernasconi as the newscast had several changes to the opening billboard. On February 21, 2000, returning media personality
Snooky Serna
joined Soriano as its new anchor, with a brand new opening billboard, graphics, soundtrack and stand-up news delivery.
On January 8, 2001, both Soriano and Serna were replaced by former teen star
Precious Hipolito-Castelo
and
Malacañang
correspondent Ron Gagalac as its new anchors maintaining the same title card, soundtrack, and graphics. On January 7, 2002,
Noli Eala
became Castelo's new co-anchor replacing Gagalac, which he transferred to
ABS-CBN
as a news reporter years later. By that time, the newscast expanded its broadcasting time to 60 minutes on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays (as Wednesdays and Fridays paved way for the
PBA on IBC
coverage) and had several changes later on.
Several months later in the same year, Eala was replaced by Adrian Ayalin as the former was appointed to anchor
IBC News Tonight
. In 2004, after IBC relaunched its slogan and station ID ("Ang Bagong Pilipino") in December 2003, the newscast also done changes to its studios, opening billboard and graphics; and it also reused its first soundtrack theme of the newscast (which used from the latter's debut in 1998 to 2000) for follow-details before and after news reports. A year later,
Ali Atienza
replaced Ayalin, which he transferred to
ABS-CBN
as a news reporter. However, Atienza left the newscast in 2007 in order to run for
mayor of Manila
. He was temporarily replaced by Errol Dacame. In 2008,
DZRH
radio anchor Bing Formento became Castelo's new co-anchor replacing Atienza. The team-up continued until 2009 when Castelo decided to run for Councilor of Quezon City.
On November 9, 2009, Jake Morales replaced Hipolito-Castelo and Formento as its new anchor; the newscast relaunched to their graphics, soundtrack and opening billboard. For several weeks, Morales was joined by Toni Marcelo, and then, later on, Karen Padilla finally took the anchor's chair replacing the former. However, Padilla, being the wife of
Erwin Tulfo
, left the newscast in early 2011 to be acquired by
TV5
to anchor for
Aksyon Breaking
on
AksyonTV
, leaving Morales as the sole anchor of the program, he was joined by Cathy Eigenmann as his new co-anchor on May 16, 2011.
On June 20, 2011, Chal Lontoc and Zyrene Parsad-Valencia took over the new and final anchors. The newscast ceased airing on August 5, 2011, to make way for the afternoon edition of
News Team 13
.

Views on the war between Russia and Ukraine
[
edit
]
According to Hautala, an independent Ukraine is an impossible idea to the Russian leadership. Unfortunate for Ukraine, Russia has usurped her early history and made it part of the Russian mythical beginning. He believes that, for Russia, no separate Ukraine can exist. During the Tsarist Russia, the state repressed heavily the Ukrainian national culture, the Ukrainians were not granted any national institutions or their own educational system. Neither did the Russian regime take the Ukrainian national ideas seriously later. “Ukraine in a sense cannot exist, because it is in contradiction with the Russian idea of history, it is an insult to it. An independent Ukraine is also in contradiction with the Russian idea of Russia as a superpower. It is felt that Russia without Ukraine is too small a player on the international scene.”

Napoleonic Wars
. Stemming from a French
Huguenot
family; he notably
held the fortress of Graudenz
against Napoleon's troops throughout 1807, long past the
Peace of Tilsit
, until the siege was finally lifted after 11 months.
Early life
[
edit
]
Wilhelm René
[Note 1]
de l'Homme de Courbière was born on 25 February 1733 into a Franco-Dutch family, paternally expatriates from the
Dauphiné
province, in
Maastricht
in the
Dutch Republic
. Following his father, Alexis Baron de l’Homme de Courbière, young Courbière joined the
Dutch States Army
in 1746. He served with the Regiment d’Aylva in the
War of the Austrian Succession
, participating in the
defense of Bergen op Zoom
. He left Dutch service in 1753 and entered the
Prussian Army
as a company commander in 1757. Then he  served in the
Third Silesian
and
Pomeranian wars
. Gaining the attention of King
Frederick the Great
, after the
Siege of Schweidnitz (1758)
he was given the rank of Major and command of a
free battalion
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
After the
Siege of Dresden
he received the
Pour le Mérite
.
[4]
[5]
He also fought at
Liegnitz
and
Torgau
.
[1]
Prussian service
[
edit
]
When the war ended he stayed in the army as garrison commander at
Emden
. In 1766 Courbière married Sophie von Weiss. The couple, married until her death in 1809, had nine children. Among the laters' private teachers was
Johann Gottfried Seume
. Courbière was a known
duellist
, fighting at least two duels during his time in Emden.
[6]
Among Courbière's descendants was
René de l'Homme de Courbière
, who served as Generalleutnant in the
Wehrmacht
during
World War II
. Wilhelm René de l'Homme de Courbière was made a
Generalmajor
in 1780 and was a
Generalleutnant
when the
French Revolutionary Wars
began. In those he led formations at
Verdun
and
Pirmasens
, receiving the
Order of the Red Eagle
for the later.
[2]
Then he became a corps commander and in 1798 he was promoted to
General der Infanterie
.
[1]
In 1802 he was bestowed with the knighthood of the
Order of the Black Eagle
.
[3]
Napoleonic Wars
[
edit
]
The city and fortress of Graudenz along the Vistula river
In 1803 he was made governor and garrison commander at
Graudenz
, a fortress and city along the
Vistula
in
West Prussia
.
[1]
During the
War of the Fourth Coalition
much of Prussia was occupied after the
Battle of Jena-Auerstedt
and the
Fall of Berlin
in 1806. King
Frederick William III of Prussia
himself relocated to
East Prussia
, staying at Gradenz for a day during his journey.
[7]
While in the follow-up months many isolated Prussian fortresses and detachments surrendered or dissolved, Courbière and his roughly 5,700-strong garrison stood firm on 22 January 1807, when French troops took the city of Graudenz and began blockading the fortress. The French forces consisted of French and Hessian troops as well as contingents of
Polish insurgents
. Initially commanded by General
Marie François Rouyer
, their numerous demands to surrender were refused by Courbière. Then, after briefly leaving the field, they reoccupied the city and, by now commanded by General
Johann Georg von Schäffer-Bernstein
, started besieging the fortress again.
[8]
In March
Napoleon
, impending to
besiege Danzig
(situated down on the end of the Vistula), sent General
Anne Jean Marie René Savary
to demand surrender again. In one of his depeches Savary argued that there was no King of Prussia anymore as he had left his lands in French hands. However, in reference to King Frederick William Courbière refused to surrender and verbally answered
"While there may be no King of Prussia anymore there still is a King of Graudenz."
, though the exact wording or meaning is somewhat disputed.
[Note 2]
[2]
[5]
[9]
In the following months the siege was intensified, the French got more reinforcements and after Danzig fell command was briefly given to
Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno
before Rouyer took over again.
[10]
Graudenz was still in Prussian hands when the
Peace of Tilsit
was signed on 9 July, however Courbière did not receive confirmation of this until 27 July. Enclosed in the official dispatch was a royal commission promoting him to
Generalfeldmarschall
.
[11]
Meanwhile, the French, against the statutes of the signed treaty, upheld their blockade of the fortress and continued to occupy the area; their troops now consisted mainly of Saxons under General
Georg Friedrich August von Polenz
. After the borders between Prussia and the new
Duchy of Warsaw
were finally set, with Graudenz remaining Prussian territory, on 12 December the blockade was lifted and the last French troops left the city. The siege had ended after 313 days with some 3,140 men remaining in the garrison.
[12]
Later life and legacy
[
edit
]
Courbiere's house within the citadel at Graudenz
Afterwards Courbière was named governor general of West Prussia and kept his official residence in Graudenz. He died there on 23 July 1811 and was laid to rest in the garden of the fortress headquarters.
[2]
[13]
The general was the namesake of two regiments; the 58th Infantry Regiment "von Courbière", which eventually became the
7th (2nd West Prussian) Grenadier Regiment "King William I"
, and decades later the
19th (2nd Posen) Infantry Regiment "von Courbière"
.
[14]
Likewise the fortress he defended carried his name from 1893 until it became a Polish possession in 1920 after
World War I
.
[15]
His monument there was removed in the same year.
[16]
He also was the namesake of streets in Emden and Berlin as well as a square in the latter.

was not aired on the
BBC
, which instead broadcast a repeat episode of the 1970s sitcom

[
edit
]

Ding Junhui
13-7, eliminating the two remaining non-English competitors from the tournament.
[29]
Walden reached the semi-finals of the World Championship on his third attempt, despite not having previously won a match in his earlier appearances in the main stages of the event in
2009
and
2011
.
[42]
Semi-finals
[
edit
]
The semi-finals were played between 2 and 4 May 2013 over four sessions as the best-of-33 frames. This was the third semi-finals round in the modern history of snooker in which all of the players were English.
[43]
O'Sullivan played Judd Trump in the first semi-final; in the 23rd frame, O'Sullivan received a reprimand from referee
Michaela Tabb
for allegedly making an obscene gesture with his cue. A World Snooker spokesman later stated eyewitnesses had also observed O'Sullivan making an inappropriate gesture but it was not captured on camera.
[44]
O'Sullivan defeated Trump 17-11
[29]
and became the first defending champion to reach the final since

Final
[
edit
]

[48]
O'Sullivan led 5-3 after the first session; Hawkins drew level at 7-7 but O'Sullivan won the last three frames of the day to take a 10-7 overnight lead.

[52]
O'Sullivan went on to win the final 18-12 to take his fifth world title
[53]
and become the first defending champion to retain his title since Hendry in 1996

[53]
Eight century breaks were scored in the final, equalling the record set in the
2002 final
between Hendry and Peter Ebdon.
[55]
At the age of 37, O'Sullivan became the oldest World Snooker Champion since 45-year-old
Ray Reardon
in
1978
.
[56]
This was O'Sullivan's fifth world championship but he did not rule out a similar season away from the tour, saying; "I had my year out and enjoyed my year out. I intend to play in some small events. Come December or January I'll have a better idea of what I'm going to do."
[54]
[57]
As world champion, O'Sullivan was awarded a
wild card
place at the
2014 Masters

Pope Pius XII
(
Italian
:
Pio XII
), born
Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli
(
Italian pronunciation:
[euˈdʒɛːnjo
maˈriːa
dʒuˈzɛppe
dʒoˈvanni
paˈtʃɛlli]
; 2 March 1876 - 9 October 1958), was head of the
Catholic Church
and sovereign of the
Vatican City State
from 2 March 1939 until his death in October 1958. Before
his election to the papacy
, he served as secretary of the
Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs
,
papal nuncio to Germany
, and
Cardinal Secretary of State
, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with various European and Latin American nations, including the
Reichskonkordat
treaty with the
German Reich
.
[1]
While the Vatican was officially neutral during
World War II
, the
Reichskonkordat
and his leadership of the Catholic Church during the war remain the subject of controversy—including allegations of public silence and inaction about the fate of the Jews.
[2]
Pius employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the
Nazis
during the war and, through directing the church to provide discreet aid to Jews and others, saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
[3]
[4]
Pius maintained
links to the German resistance
, and shared intelligence with the Allies. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonoured his policy of Vatican neutrality.
[5]
During his papacy, the Catholic Church issued the
Decree against Communism
, declaring that Catholics who profess
communist
doctrine are to be
excommunicated
as
apostates
from the Christian faith.
The church experienced severe persecution
and mass deportations of Catholic clergy in the
Eastern Bloc
. He explicitly invoked
ex cathedra
papal infallibility
with the
dogma
of the
Assumption of Mary
in his
Apostolic constitution
Munificentissimus Deus
.
[6]
His
forty-one encyclicals
include
Mystici Corporis Christi
, on the Church as the
Mystical Body of Christ
;
Mediator Dei
on liturgy reform; and
Humani generis
, in which he instructed
theologians
to adhere to episcopal teaching and allowed that the human body might have
evolved
from earlier forms. He eliminated the Italian majority in the
College of Cardinals
in 1946.
After he died in 1958, Pope Pius XII was succeeded by
John XXIII
. In the process toward sainthood, his cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by
Paul VI
during the final session of the
Second Vatican Council
. He was made a
Servant of God
by
John Paul II
in 1990 and
Benedict XVI
declared Pius XII
Venerable
on 19 December 2009.

Early life
[

Main article:
Early life of Pope Pius XII
Eugenio Pacelli at the age of six in 1882
Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli was born on the second day of Lent, 2 March 1876, in
Rome
into a family of intense Catholic piety with a history of ties to the papacy (the "
Black Nobility
"). His parents were
Filippo Pacelli
[
it
]
(1837-1916) and Virginia (née Graziosi) Pacelli (1844-1920). His grandfather
Marcantonio Pacelli
[
it
]
had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances
[8]
and then Secretary of the Interior under
Pope Pius IX
from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper,
L'Osservatore Romano
in 1861.
[9]
[10]
His cousin,
Ernesto Pacelli
, was a key financial advisor to
Pope Leo XIII
; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a
Franciscan
tertiary
,
[11]
was the dean of the
Roman Rota
; and his brother,
Francesco Pacelli
, became a
lay
canon lawyer
and the legal advisor to
Pope Pius XI
, in which role he negotiated the
Lateran Treaty
in 1929 with
Benito Mussolini
, bringing an end to the
Roman Question
.
Together with his brother Francesco (1872-1935) and his two sisters, Giuseppina (1874-1955) and Elisabetta (1880-1970),
[12]
he grew up in the
Parione
district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880, he began school at the convent of the French
Sisters of Divine Providence
in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at
Chiesa Nuova
. Eugenio and the other children made their
First Communion
at this church and Eugenio served there as an
altar boy
from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the
Piazza Venezia
.
[13]
In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the
Collegio Romano
, the premier Jesuit university in Rome.
In 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the
Almo Collegio Capranica
,
[14]
and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit
Pontifical Gregorian University
and theology at the
Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare
. He was also enrolled at the
State University, La Sapienza
where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.
[15]
Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in
Latin
.
[16]
Church career
[
edit
]
Priest and monsignor
[
edit
]
Pacelli on the day of his ordination: 2 April 1899
While all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the
Basilica of Saint John Lateran
,
[17]
Pacelli was
ordained
a priest on
Easter Sunday
, 2 April 1899, alone in the private chapel of a family friend the
Vicegerent
of Rome,
Francesco di Paola Cassetta
. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant'Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a
curate
at
Chiesa Nuova
.
[18]
In 1901, he entered the
Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs
, a sub-office of the
Vatican Secretariat of State
.
[19]
Pietro Gasparri
, the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the "Vatican's equivalent of the Foreign office" by highlighting the "necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe".
[20]
Pacelli became an
apprendista
, an apprentice, in Gasparri's department. In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to King
Edward VII
of the UK after the death of
Queen Victoria
.
[21]
The Serbian Concordat, 24 June 1914. Present for the Vatican were
Cardinal Merry del Val
and next to him, Pacelli.
By 1904 Pacelli received his doctorate. The theme of his thesis was the nature of
concordats
and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of
minutante
, he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a
papal chamberlain
. In 1905 he received the title
domestic prelate
.
[18]
From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of
canon law
with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs.
[22]
According to
John Cornwell
"the text, together with the
Anti-Modernist Oath
, became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church".
[23]
In 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the
International Eucharistic Congress
, accompanying
Rafael Merry del Val
[24]
to London,
[21]
where he met
Winston Churchill
.
[25]
In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the
coronation
of King
George V
.
[22]
Pacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under
Pope Pius X
and retained under
Pope Benedict XV
), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914.
[22]
On 24 June 1914, just four days before
Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
was assassinated in
Sarajevo
, Pacelli, together with
Cardinal Merry del Val
, represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed.
Serbia
's success in the
First Balkan War
against
Turkey
in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging
Austria-Hungary
's sphere of influence throughout the
Balkans
. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary.
[26]
During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of
prisoners of war
and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to
Vienna
to assist
Raffaele Scapinelli
,
nuncio
to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor
Franz Joseph I of Austria
regarding Italy.
[27]
Archbishop and papal nuncio
[
edit
]
Main article:
Nunciature of Eugenio Pacelli
Pacelli at the Headquarters of
Wilhelm II
Pope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as
nuncio to Bavaria
on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as
titular
Archbishop of Sardis
in the
Sistine Chapel
on 13 May 1917, the same day as the
first apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary
in
Fatima, Portugal
. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for
Bavaria
. As there was no nuncio to
Prussia
or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the
German Empire
.
Once in
Munich
, he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities.
[28]
He met with
King Ludwig III
on 29 May, and later with
Kaiser Wilhelm II
[29]
and Chancellor
Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg
, who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.
Sister Pascalina later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned a "deaf ear to all his proposals". She later wrote, "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the
Rhine
with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well'. I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right."
[30]
For the remainder of the Great War, Pacelli concentrated on Benedict's humanitarian efforts
[31]
especially among Allied POWs in German custody.
[32]
In the upheaval following the Armistice, a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV's permission to leave Munich, where
Kurt Eisner
had formed the
Free State of Bavaria
, and he left for a while to
Rorschach
, and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Schioppa, the
uditore
, was left in Munich.
[33]
"His recovery began with a 'rapport
'
" with the 24-year-old Sister
Pascalina Lehnert
- she would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli "pulled strings at the highest level".
[34]
When he returned to Munich, following Eisner's assassination by Bavarian nationalist
Count Anton von Arco auf Valley
, he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa's eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of
Max Levien
,
Eugen Levine
, and Towia Axelrod sought power: "the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien's mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorcée [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ..." John Cornwell alleges that a worrying impression of anti-Semitism is discernible in the "catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness" and Pacelli's "constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers" chimed with the "growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization".
[35]
Also according to Cornwell, Pacelli informed Gasparri that "the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny".

Pacelli in Bavaria, 1922
According to Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the Nuncio was repeatedly threatened by emissaries of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Once, in a violation of international law, the Bavarian Revolutionary Government attempted to confiscate the Nunciature's car at gunpoint. Despite their demands, however, Pacelli refused to leave his post.
[37]
After the
Munich Soviet Republic
was defeated and toppled by
Freikorps
and
Reichswehr
troops, the Nuncio focused on, according to Lehnert, "alleviating the distress of the postwar period, consoling, supporting all in word and deed".
[38]
Nuncio Pacelli in July 1924 at the 900th anniversary of the City of
Bamberg
Pacelli was appointed
Apostolic Nuncio to Germany
on 23 June 1920, and - after the completion of a Bavarian concordat - his nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor
Robert Leiber
and Sister
Pascalina Lehnert
—housekeeper, cook, friend, and adviser for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest
Ludwig Kaas
, who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic
Centre Party
, a party he led following
Wilhelm Marx
's resignation in October 1928.
[39]
While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended
Katholikentag
(national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people.
[40]
In Berlin he lived in the
Tiergarten
quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite.
Paul von Hindenburg
,
Gustav Stresemann
, and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests.

In post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Catholic Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister
Georgi Chicherin
, who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.
[41]
Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until
Pius XI
ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the
Saar region
, supported the appointment of a papal administrator for
Danzig
and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.
[42]
A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929. Following the
Wall Street Crash of 1929
, the beginnings of a world economic slump appeared, and the days of the
Weimar Republic
were numbered. Pacelli was summoned back to Rome at this time—the call coming by telegram when he was resting at his favourite retreat, the Rorschach convent sanatorium. He left Berlin on 10 December 1929.
[43]
David Dalin wrote "of the forty-four speeches Pacelli gave in Germany as papal nuncio between 1917 and 1929, forty denounced some aspect of the emerging Nazi ideology".
[44]
In 1935 he wrote a letter to the bishop of Cologne describing the Nazis as "false prophets with the pride of Lucifer". and as "bearers of a new faith and a new Evangile" who were attempting to create "a mendacious antimony between faithfulness to the Church and the Fatherland".
[45]
Two years later at Notre Dame in Paris he named Germany as "that noble and powerful nation whom bad shepherds would lead astray into an ideology of race".

Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo
[

, 1934
Pacelli was made a
Cardinal-Priest
of
Santi Giovanni e Paolo
on 16 December 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and within a few months, on 7 February 1930, Pius XI appointed him
Cardinal Secretary of State
, responsible for foreign policy and state relations throughout the world. In 1935, Pacelli was named
Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church
.
As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a
Baden
Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy,
Conrad Gröber
, the new
Archbishop of Freiburg
, and the treaty was signed in August
1932.
[46]
Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933),
Yugoslavia
(1935) and Portugal (1940). The
Lateran treaties
with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic
Catholic Popular Party
, in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged
Catholic Action
, "an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing". It was permitted only so long as it developed "its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles".
[47]
Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of
nullity
in the area of marriage).
[48]
As the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor
Heinrich Brüning
, who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he "misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis".
[49]
Following Brüning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor
Franz von Papen
, wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, "that would correspond to their principles".
[50]
He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an
extensive visit to the United States in 1936
where he met President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
, who appointed a personal envoy—who did not require Senate confirmation—to the
Holy See
in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the pope lost
temporal power
.

This traditional adversarial relationship with Judaism would be reversed in

[54]
According to
Joseph Bottum
, Pacelli in 1937 "warned A. W. Klieforth, the American consul to Berlin, that
Hitler
was 'an untrustworthy scoundrel and fundamentally wicked person', to quote Klieforth, who also wrote that Pacelli 'did not believe Hitler capable of moderation, and ... fully supported the German bishops in their anti-Nazi stand'. This was matched with the discovery of Pacelli's
anti-Nazi
report, written the following year for President Roosevelt and filed with Ambassador
Joseph Kennedy
, which declared that the church regarded compromise with the
Third Reich
as 'out of the question'."
[55]
Historian Walter Bussmann argued that Pacelli, as Cardinal Secretary of State, dissuaded Pope Pius XI - who was nearing death at the time
[56]
—from condemning the
Kristallnacht
in November 1938,
[57]
when he was informed of it by the papal nuncio in Berlin.
[58]
The draft encyclical
Humani generis unitas
("On the Unity of the Human Race") was ready in September 1938 but, according to those responsible for an edition of the document
[59]
and other sources, it was not forwarded to the Holy See by the Jesuit General
Wlodimir Ledóchowski
.
[60]
[61]
The draft encyclical contained an open and clear condemnation of
colonialism
, racial persecution and
antisemitism
.
[60]
[62]
[
]
[63]
Historians Passelecq and Suchecky have argued that Pacelli learned about the existence of the draft only after the death of Pius XI and did not promulgate it as Pope.
[64]
He did use parts of it in his inaugural encyclical
Summi Pontificatus
, which he titled "On the Unity of Human Society".
[65]
His various positions on church and policy issues during his tenure as Cardinal Secretary of State were made public by the Holy See in 1939. Most noteworthy among the 50 speeches is his review of Church-State issues in Budapest in 1938.

, Secretary of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs

,

, and Reich minister

The
Reichskonkordat
was an integral part of four
concordats
Pacelli concluded on behalf of the Vatican with German States. The state concordats were necessary because the German
federalist
Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.
[67]
[68]
Prussia showed interest in negotiations only after the Bavarian concordat. However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.
[69]
A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922-1932.
[70]
The
Reichskonkordat
, signed on 20 July 1933, between Germany and the Holy See, while thus a part of an overall Vatican policy, was controversial from its beginning. It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (§31), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.
[71]
As
nuncio
during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.
[72]
[73]
Adolf Hitler
was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and sought to gain international respectability and to remove internal opposition by representatives of the church and the Catholic
Centre Party
. He sent his vice chancellor
Franz von Papen
, a Catholic nobleman, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat.
[74]
[75]
On behalf of Pacelli, Prelate Ludwig Kaas, the outgoing chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated first drafts of the terms with Papen.
[76]
The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July and ratified on 10 September 1933.
[77]
Bishop Preysing
cautioned against compromise with the new regime, against those who saw the Nazi persecution of the church as an aberration that Hitler would correct.
[78]
Between 1933 and 1939, Pacelli issued 55 protests of violations of the
Reichskonkordat
. Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal
Michael von Faulhaber
, to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the
Reichskonkordat
; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical,
Mit brennender Sorge
. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual
Latin
of official Catholic Church documents. Secretly distributed by an army of motorcyclists and read from every German Catholic Church pulpit on
Palm Sunday
, it condemned the
paganism
of the
Nazi
ideology.
[79]
Pius XI credited its creation and writing to Pacelli.
[80]
It was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization and resulted in persecution of the church by the infuriated Nazis who closed all the participating presses and "took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy".
[81]
On 10 June 1941, the pope commented on the problems of the
Reichskonkordat
in a letter to the
Bishop of Passau
, in Bavaria: "The history of the Reichskonkordat shows, that the other side lacked the most basic prerequisites to accept minimal freedoms and rights of the Church, without which the Church simply cannot live and operate, formal agreements notwithstanding".

Pope Pius XII appears on the central loggia after his election on 2 March 1939
The signature of Pius XII never changed
[84]
Pope Pius XI died on 10 February 1939. Several historians have interpreted the conclave to choose his successor as facing a choice between a diplomatic or a spiritual candidate, and they view Pacelli's diplomatic experience, especially with Germany, as one of the deciding factors in his election on 2 March 1939, his 63rd birthday, after only one day of deliberation and three ballots.
[85]
[86]
He was the first cardinal Secretary of State to be elected pope since
Clement IX
in 1667.
[87]
He was one of only two men known to have served as
Camerlengo
immediately prior to being elected as pope (the other being
Pope Leo XIII
). According to rumours, he asked for another ballot to be taken to ensure the validity of his election. After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.
His
coronation
took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian
Order of the Holy Sepulchre
of
Jerusalem
,
prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office
,
prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches
and
prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation
. There was however a Cardinal-Secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis.
Pacelli took the same papal name as his predecessor, a title used exclusively by
Italian Popes
. He was quoted as saying "I call myself Pius; my whole life was under Popes with this name, but especially as a sign of gratitude towards
Pius XI
."
[88]
On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying "He is in your midst."
[89]
[90]
He had previously been quoted as saying: "When today the Pope dies, you'll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one. I pray every day, God may send another one into one of our seminaries, but as of today, there is only one in this world."
[91]
Appointments
[
edit
]
After his election, he made
Luigi Maglione
his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Giovanni Battista Montini (later
Pope Paul VI
) and
Domenico Tardini
. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.
[92]
Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,
[93]
an honor which both turned down.
[94]
They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.
[95]
Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of
Milan
, after the death of
Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster
.
Pius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the
Roman Curia
; he employed German and
Dutch
Jesuit
advisors, Robert Leiber,
Augustin Bea
, and
Sebastian Tromp
. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal
Francis Spellman
from a minor to a major role in the church.
[96]
[97]
After World War II, Pius XII appointed more non-Italians than any Pope before him. American appointees included
Joseph P. Hurley
as regent of the nunciature in Belgrade,
Gerald P. O'Hara
as nuncio to
Romania
, and
Aloisius Joseph Muench
as nuncio to Germany. For the first time, numerous young Europeans, Asians and "Americans were trained in various congregations and secretariats within the Vatican for eventual service throughout the world".
[98]
Consistories

Cardinals created by Pius XII
One of the first official color portraits of Pius XII,
c.
1939 - 40
Only twice in his pontificate did Pius XII hold a
consistory
to create new
cardinals
, in contrast to Pius XI, who had done so 17 times in as many years. Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with
Dennis Joseph Dougherty
of
Philadelphia
being the only living U.S. cardinal.
The first occasion on 18 February 1946 yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost half of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.
[a]
In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from
China
,
India
, the
Middle East
and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.
[99]
In his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs.
Domenico Tardini
and Giovanni Montini would be elevated
[100]
and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list,
[101]
but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions.
[102]
Both Montini and Tardini would become Cardinals shortly after Pius' death; Montini later became
Pope Paul VI
. The two consistories of 1946 and 1953 brought an end to over five hundred years of Italians constituting a majority of the
College of Cardinals
.
[103]
With few exceptions, Italian prelates accepted the changes positively; there was no protest movement or open opposition to the internationalization efforts.

Main articles:
Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII

In his encyclical
Mediator Dei
, Pius XII links
liturgy
with the last will of
Jesus Christ
.
But it is His will, that the worship He instituted and practiced during His life on earth shall continue ever afterwards without intermission. For He has not left mankind an orphan. He still offers us the support of His powerful, unfailing intercession, acting as our "advocate with the Father". He aids us likewise through His Church, where He is present indefectibly as the ages run their course: through the Church which He constituted "the pillar of truth" and dispenser of grace, and which by His sacrifice on the cross, He founded, consecrated and confirmed forever.
[105]
The church has, therefore, according to Pius XII, a common aim with Christ himself, teaching all men the truth, and offering to God a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice. This way, the church re-establishes the unity between the
Creator
and His creatures.
[106]
The Sacrifice of the Altar, being Christ's own actions, conveys and dispenses divine grace from Christ to the members of the Mystical Body.

Eastern canonical reforms of Pius XII
Decentralized authority and increased independence of the Uniate Churches were aimed at in the
Canon Law
/Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the
encyclical
Mystici Corporis Christi
.
Priests and religious
[
edit
]
With the
Apostolic constitution
Sedis Sapientiae
, Pius XII added
social sciences
,
sociology
,
psychology
and
social psychology
, to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the
psychological
condition of candidates to the
priesthood
to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service.
[110]
Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests. He included a "pastoral year", an introduction into the practice of parish work.
[111]
Pius XII wrote in
Menti Nostrae
that the call to constant interior reform and Christian
heroism
means to be above average, to be a living example of Christian virtue. The strict norms governing their lives are meant to make them models of Christian perfection for lay people.
[112]
Bishops are encouraged to look at model saints like
Boniface
, and Pope Pius X.

Priests were encouraged to be living examples of the love of Christ and his sacrifice.

Pius XII explained the Catholic faith in 41 encyclicals and almost 1000 messages and speeches during his long pontificate.
Mystici Corporis Christi
clarified membership and participation in the church. The encyclical
Divino afflante Spiritu
opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints,
Mary
, the
Mother of God
, things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.

Biblical research

Main article:
Divino afflante Spiritu
The encyclical
Divino afflante Spiritu
, published in 1943,
[116]
emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in
Greek
and
Hebrew
. Noting improvements in
archaeology
, the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the
Latin Vulgate
. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the church to initiate
biblical studies
for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in
sermons
and religious instruction.
[117]
Role of theology
[
edit
]
This theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Catholic Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the church generously supports, but in matters of
morality
and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the church, the
Magisterium
. "The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church."
[118]
The deposit of faith is authentically interpreted not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.

As a young boy and in later life, Pacelli was an ardent follower of the Virgin Mary. He was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917, the very first day of the apparitions of
Our Lady of Fátima
. Based on the
Portuguese
mystic
Alexandrina of Balazar
requests, he consecrated the world to the
Immaculate Heart of Mary
in 1942. His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of Fátima, 13 October 1958.

On 1 November 1950, Pius XII invoked
papal infallibility
for the first time since 1854 by defining the dogma of the
Assumption of Mary
, namely that she "having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory".
[120]
To date this is the last time full papal infallibility has been used. The dogma was preceded by the 1946 encyclical
Deiparae Virginis Mariae
, which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. On 8 September 1953, the encyclical
Fulgens corona
announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the
Immaculate Conception
.
[121]

Pius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers.
[125]
He addressed doctors, nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca. He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in
terminally ill
persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.

Pope Pius XII developed an extensive theology of the family, taking issue with family roles, sharing of household duties, education of children, conflict resolution, financial dilemmas, psychological problems, illness, taking care of older generations, unemployment, marital holiness and virtue, common prayer, religious discussions and more. He accepted the
rhythm method
as a moral form of
family planning
, although only in limited circumstances, within the context of family.
[127]
Theology and science
[
edit
]
To Pius XII, science and religion were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict each other over the long term.
[128]
Regarding their relation, his advisor Professor Robert Leiber wrote: "Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of
Galileo
."
[129]
Evolution of the human body
[
edit
]
Main article:
Humani generis
In 1950, Pius XII promulgated
Humani generis
, which acknowledged that
evolution
might accurately describe the biological origins of the human form, but at the same time criticized those who "imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution ... explains the origin of all things". Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God. Since the soul is a spiritual substance, it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person.
[130]
Fifty years later,
Pope John Paul II
, stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. "Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God."
[131]
Capital punishment
[
edit
]
In an address given on 14 September 1952, Pope Pius XII said that the church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life:
When it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life. In this case it is reserved to the public power to deprive the condemned person of the enjoyment of life in expiation of his crime when, by his crime, he has already disposed himself of his right to live.
[132]
The church regards criminal penalties as both "medicinal", preventing the criminal from re-offending, and "vindictive", providing retribution for the offense committed. Pius defended the authority of the State to carry out punishment, up to and including the death penalty.
[133]
Democracy and monarchy
[
edit
]
Pius XII taught that the masses were a threat to true democracy. In such a democracy, liberty is the individual's moral duty and equality is the right of all people to honorably live in the place and station that God has assigned them.
[134]
On 1 June 1946, one day before the
1946 Italian referendum
on whether to abolish or keep the Italian monarchy, Pius XII delivered a sermon on St. Peter's Square. While he did not directly mention monarchy or republicanism, given the context, his speech was nonetheless widely seen as endorsing
Umberto II
in the referendum, with it being difficult to misunderstand his plea.
[135]
Pius stated:
The problem is whether one or the other of those nations, of those two Latin sisters [elections were taking place in France on the same day] with several thousands of years of civilization will continue to learn against the solid rock of Christianity,...or on the contrary do they want to hand over the fate of their future to the impossible omnipotence of a material state without extraterrestrial ideals, without religion, and without God. One of these two alternatives shall occur according to whether the names of the champions or the destroyers of Christian civilization emerge victorious from the urns
[136]
After the referendum was successful and the Italian monarchy was abolished, Pius privately agreed with his envoy
Myron Charles Taylor
"...that it would have been far preferable for Italy to remain a monarchy, but he also noted that what was done was done".

This 19th-century painting is by
Pasquale Sarullo
.
Pius XII issued 41
encyclicals
during his pontificate—more than all his successors in the past 50 years taken together—along with many other writings and speeches. The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in
vernacular
language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in
Latin
in
Acta Apostolicae Sedis
since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared
occupation
of the Vatican by the German
Wehrmacht
, not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or "walled in".
[140]
Several encyclicals addressed the
Eastern Catholic Churches
.
Orientalis Ecclesiae
was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of
Cyril of Alexandria
, a saint common to
Eastern Christianity
and
Latin
Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the churches.
Orientales omnes Ecclesias
, issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the
Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church
, threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union.
Sempiternus Rex
was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical
Council of Chalcedon
. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to
Miaphysite
theology to return to the Catholic Church.
Orientales Ecclesias
was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued
Stalinist
persecution of the church. Several
Apostolic Letters
were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in
Fulgens corona
, as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.

Pius XII made two substantial interventions on the media. His 1955 discourse
The Ideal Movie
, originally given in two parts to members of the Italian cinema industry, offered a "sophisticated analysis of the film industry and the role of cinema in modern society".
[148]
Compared to his predecessor's teaching, the encyclical
Miranda Prorsus
(1957) shows a "high regard for the importance of cinema, television, and radio".
[149]
Feasts and devotions
[

In 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the
Holy Face of Jesus
as
Shrove Tuesday
(the Tuesday before
Ash Wednesday
) for all Catholics. The first medal of the Holy Face, produced by Sister
Maria Pierina De Micheli
, based on the image on the
Shroud of Turin
had been offered to Pius XII who approved the medal and the devotion based on it. The general devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus had been approved by
Pope Leo XIII
in 1885 before the image on the Turin Shroud had been photographed.

During World War II Pius saw his primary obligation as being to ensure the continuation of the "
Church visible
" and its divine mission.
[154]
Pius XII lobbied world leaders to prevent the outbreak of World War II and then expressed his dismay that war had come in his October 1939
Summi Pontificatus
encyclical. He followed a strict public policy of Vatican neutrality for the duration of the conflict mirroring that of
Pope Benedict XV
.
In 1939, Pius XII turned the Vatican into a centre of aid which he organized from various parts of the world.
[155]
At the request of the Pope, an information office for prisoners of war and refugees operated in the Vatican under
Giovanni Battista Montini
, which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost 10 million (9,891,497) information requests and produced over 11 million (11,293,511) answers about missing persons.
[156]
McGoldrick (2012) concludes that during the war:
Pius XII had genuine affection for Germany, though not the criminal element into whose hands it had fallen; he feared Bolshevism, an ideology dedicated to the annihilation of the church of which he was head, but his sympathies lay with the Allies and the democracies, especially the United States, into whose war economy he had transferred and invested the Vatican's considerable assets.
[157]
Outbreak of war
[
edit
]
Summi Pontificatus
[
edit
]
Summi Pontificatus
was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, in October 1939 and established some of the themes of his pontificate. During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the German/Soviet invasion of Catholic Poland—the "dread tempest of war is already raging despite all Our efforts to avert it". The papal letter denounced antisemitism, war, totalitarianism, the attack on Poland and the Nazi persecution of the church.
[158]
Pius XII reiterated church teaching on the "principle of equality"—with specific reference to Jews: "there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision".
[159]
The forgetting of solidarity "imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men" was called "pernicious error".
[160]
Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer "compassion and help" to the victims of the war.
[161]
The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war.
[162]
The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.
[163]
Following themes addressed in
Non abbiamo bisogno
(1931);
Mit brennender Sorge
(1937) and
Divini redemptoris
(1937), Pius wrote against "anti-Christian movements" and needing to bring back to the church those who were following "a false standard ... misled by error, passion, temptation and prejudice, [who] have strayed away from faith in the true God".
[164]
Pius wrote of "Christians unfortunately more in name than in fact" having shown "cowardice" in the face of persecution by these creeds, and endorsed resistance:
[164]
Who among "the Soldiers of Christ" - ecclesiastic or layman - does not feel himself incited and spurred on to a greater vigilance, to a more determined resistance, by the sight of the ever-increasing host of Christ's enemies; as he perceives the spokesmen of these tendencies deny or in practice neglect the vivifying truths and the values inherent in belief in God and in Christ; as he perceives them wantonly break the Tables of God's Commandments to substitute other tables and other standards stripped of the ethical content of the Revelation on Sinai, standards in which the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount and of the Cross has no place?
Pius wrote of a persecuted church
[165]
and a time requiring "charity" for victims who had a "right" to compassion. Against the invasion of Poland and killing of civilians he wrote:
[158]
[This is an] "Hour of Darkness"... in which the spirit of violence and of discord brings indescribable suffering on mankind... The nations swept into the tragic whirlpool of war are perhaps as yet only at the "beginnings of sorrows"... but even now there reigns in thousands of families death and desolation, lamentation and misery. The blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants, raises a piteous dirge over a nation such as Our dear Poland, which, for its fidelity to the Church, for its services in the defense of Christian civilization, written in indelible characters in the annals of history, has a right to the generous and brotherly sympathy of the whole world, while it awaits, relying on the powerful intercession of Mary, Help of Christians, the hour of a resurrection in harmony with the principles of justice and true peace.
With Italy not yet an ally of Hitler in the war, Italians were called upon to remain faithful to the Catholic Church. Pius avoided explicit denunciations of
Hitlerism
or
Stalinism
, establishing the "impartial" public tone which would become controversial in later assessment of his pontificate: "A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations."
[166]
Invasion of Poland
[
edit
]
In
Summi Pontificatus
, Pius expressed dismay at the killing of non-combatants in the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland and expressed hope for the "resurrection" of that country. The Nazis and Soviets commenced a
persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland
. In April 1940, the Vatican advised the U.S. government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid.
[167]
Michael Phayer
, a critic of Pius XII, assesses his policy as having been to "refuse to censure" the
"German" invasion and annexation of Poland
. This, Phayer wrote, was regarded as a "betrayal" by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of
Hilarius Breitinger
as the apostolic administrator for the
Wartheland
in May 1942, an "implicit recognition" of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the
Volksdeutsche
, mostly German Catholic minorities living in occupied Poland, were more mixed.
[168]
Phayer argues that Pius XII—both before and during his papacy - consistently "deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland", and saw Germany—not Poland—as critical to "rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe".
[169]
In May 1942,
Kazimierz Papée
, Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Papée declared, "when something becomes notorious, proof is not required".
[170]
Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that
Cardinal Hlond
had banned German liturgical services in Poland.
[171]
There was a well-known case of Jewish rabbis who, seeking support against the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews in the
General Government
(Nazi-occupied Polish zone), complained to the representatives of the Catholic Church. The church's attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about
Nazi atrocities committed in Poland
by both officials of the Polish Church and the
Polish Underground
. Those intelligence materials were used by Pius XII on 11 March 1940 during a formal audience with
Joachim von Ribbentrop
(Hitler's foreign affairs adviser) when Pope was "listing the date, place, and precise details of each crime" as described by
Joseph L. Lichten
[172]
after others.
Early actions to end conflict
[
edit
]
With Poland overrun, but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Pius continued to hope for a negotiated peace to prevent the spread of the conflict. The similarly minded U.S. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a 70-year hiatus and dispatched
Myron C. Taylor
as his personal representative.
[173]
Pius warmly welcomed Roosevelt's envoy and peace initiative, calling it "an exemplary act of fraternal and hearty solidarity... in defence against the chilling breath of aggressive and deadly godless anti-Christian tendencies".
[174]
American correspondence spoke of "parallel endeavours for peace and the alleviation of suffering".
[175]
Despite the early collapse of peace hopes, the Taylor mission continued at the Vatican.
[173]
According to Hitler biographer
John Toland
, following the November 1939 assassination attempt by
Johann Georg Elser
, Hitler said Pius would have wanted the plot to succeed: "he's no friend of mine".
[176]
In the spring of 1940, a group of German generals seeking to overthrow Hitler and make peace with the British approached Pope Pius XII, who acted as an interlocutor between the British and the abortive plot.
[177]
According to Toland, Munich lawyer,
Joseph Muller
, made a clandestine trip to Rome in October 1939, met with Pius XII and found him willing to act as intermediary. The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals
Franz Halder
and
Walther von Brauchitsch
to act against Hitler.
[178]
Pius warned the Allies of the planned German invasion of the Low Countries in 1940.
[179]
In Rome in 1942, U.S. envoy Myron C. Taylor, thanked the Holy See for the "forthright and heroic expressions of indignation made by Pope Pius XII when Germany invaded the Low countries".
[180]
After Germany invaded the
Low Countries
during 1940, Pius XII sent expressions of sympathy to the
Queen of the Netherlands
, the
King of Belgium
, and the
Grand Duchess of Luxembourg
. When Mussolini learned of the warnings and the telegrams of sympathy, he took them as a personal affront and had his ambassador to the Vatican file an official protest, charging that Pius XII had taken sides against Italy's ally Germany. Mussolini's foreign minister claimed that Pius XII was "ready to let himself be deported to a concentration camp, rather than do anything against his conscience".
[181]
When, in 1940, the Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop led the only senior Nazi delegation permitted an audience with Pius XII and asked why the Pope had sided with the Allies, Pius replied with a list of recent Nazi atrocities and religious persecutions committed against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, leading the New York Times to headline its report "Jews Rights Defended" and write of "burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution".
[182]
During the meeting, Ribbentrop suggested an overall settlement between the Vatican and the Reich government in exchange for Pius XII instructing the German bishops to refrain from political criticism of the German government, but no agreement was reached.
[183]
The investments of
Bernardino Nogara
were critical to the financing of the papacy during World War II.
At a special mass at St Peters for the victims of the war, held in November 1940, soon after the commencement of the
London Blitz
bombing by the
Luftwaffe
, Pius preached in his homily: "may the whirlwinds, that in the light of day or the dark of night, scatter terror, fire, destruction, and slaughter on helpless folk cease. May justice and charity on one side and on the other be in perfect balance, so that all injustice be repaired, the reign of right restored".
[184]
Later he appealed to the Allies to spare Rome from aerial bombing, and visited wounded victims of the
Allied bombing of 19 July 1943
.
[185]
Widening conflict
[
edit
]
Pius attempted, unsuccessfully, to dissuade the Italian Dictator
Benito Mussolini
from joining Hitler in the war.
[186]
In April 1941, Pius XII granted a private audience to
Ante Pavelić
, the leader of the
newly proclaimed Croatian state
(rather than the diplomatic audience Pavelić had wanted).
[187]
Pius was criticised for his reception of Pavelić: an unattributed British
Foreign Office
memo on the subject described Pius as "the greatest moral coward of our age".
[188]
The Vatican did not officially recognise Pavelić's regime. While Pius XII did not publicly condemn the expulsions and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated on Serbs by Pavelić,
[189]
the Holy See did expressly repudiate the forced conversions in a memorandum dated 25 January 1942, from the Vatican Secretariat of State to the Yugoslavian Legation.
[190]
The pope was well informed of
Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše
regime, even possessing a list of clergymembers who had "joined in the slaughter", but decided against condemning the regime or taking action against the clergy involved, fearing that it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state.
[191]
Pius XII would elevate
Aloysius Stepinac
—a Croatian archbishop convicted of collaborating with the
Ustaše
by the newly established
Yugoslav Communist regime
—to the cardinalate in 1953.
[192]
Phayer agrees that Stepinac's was a "show trial", but states "the charge that he [Pius XII] supported the Ustaša regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew",
[193]
and that "if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican's support of the
genocidal
Pavelić".
[194]
Throughout 1942, the
Yugoslav government in exile
sent letters of protest to Pius XII asking him to use all possible means to stop the massacres against the
Serbs
in the
NDH
, however Pius XII did nothing.
[195]
In 1941, Pius XII interpreted
Divini Redemptoris
, an
encyclical
of Pope Pius XI, which forbade Catholics to help Communists, as not applying to military assistance to the
Soviet Union
. This interpretation assuaged American Catholics who had previously opposed
Lend-Lease
arrangements with the Soviet Union.

In March 1942, Pius XII established diplomatic relations with the
Japanese Empire
and received ambassador
Ken Harada
, who remained in that position until the end of the war.
[196]
[197]
In June 1942, diplomatic relations were established with the
Nationalist government
of China. This step was envisaged earlier, but delayed due to Japanese pressure to establish relations with the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei government. The first
Chinese Minister to the Vatican
, Hsieh Shou-kang, was only able to arrive at the Vatican in January 1943, due to difficulties of travel resulting from the war. He remained in that position until late 1946.
[198]
The Pope employed the new technology of
radio
and a series of Christmas messages to preach against selfish nationalism and the evils of modern warfare and offer sympathy to the victims of the war.
[185]
Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address
via
Vatican Radio
voiced concern at
human rights abuses
and the murder of innocents based on race. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society; at the very end of the speech, Pius XII mentioned "the hundreds of thousands of persons who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline".
[199]
According to Rittner, the speech remains a "lightning rod" in debates about Pius XII.
[200]
The Nazis themselves responded to the speech by stating that it was "one long attack on everything we stand for. ... He is clearly speaking on behalf of the Jews. ... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews, and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals." The New York Times wrote that "The voice of Pius XII is a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas. ... In calling for a 'real new order' based on 'liberty, justice and love', ... the pope put himself squarely against Hitlerism."
[201]
Historian Michael Phayer claims, however, that "it is still not clear
whose
genocide or
which
genocide he was referring to".
[202]
Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius's death in 2008, the German Pope
Benedict XVI
recalled that the Pope's voice had been "broken by emotion" as he "deplored the situation" with a "clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews".
[203]
Several authors have
alleged a plot to kidnap Pius XII
by the Nazis during their occupation of Rome in 1943 (Vatican City itself was not occupied); British historian
Owen Chadwick
and the Jesuit
ADSS
editor
Rev. Robert Graham
each concluded such claims were an intentional creation of the British
Political Warfare Executive
.
[204]
[205]
However, in 2007, subsequently to those accounts, Dan Kurzman published a work in which he establishes that the plot was a fact.
[206]
In 1944, Pius XII issued a Christmas message in which he warned against rule by the masses and against secular conceptions of liberty and equality.
[134]
Final stages
[

As the war was approaching its end in 1945, Pius advocated a lenient policy by the
Allied
leaders in an effort to prevent what he perceived to be the mistakes made at the end of World War I.
[207]
On 23 August 1944, he met British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
, who was visiting Rome. At their meeting, the Pope acknowledged the justice of punishing war criminals, but expressed a hope that the people of Italy would not be punished, preferring that they be made "full allies" in the remaining war effort.

Pope Pius XII by
Peter McIntyre
c.1943-1944
During the Second World War, after Nazi Germany commenced its mass-murder of Jews in occupied Soviet territory, Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid victims of the Holocaust and directed the church to provide discreet aid to Jews.
[209]
Upon his death in 1958, among many Jewish tributes, the Chief Rabbi of Rome
Elio Toaff
, said: "Jews will always remember what the Catholic Church did for them by order of the Pope during the Second World War. When the war was raging, Pius spoke out very often to condemn the false race theory."
[210]
This is disputed by commentator John Cornwell, who, in his book,
Hitler's Pope
, argues that the pope was weak and vacillating in his approach to Nazism. Cornwell asserts that the pope did little to challenge the progressing holocaust of the Jews out of fear of provoking the Nazis into invading Vatican City.
[211]
In his 1939
Summi Pontificatus
first papal encyclical, Pius reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and antisemitism and affirmed the ethical principles of the "
Revelation on Sinai
". At Christmas 1942, once evidence of the mass-murder of Jews had emerged, Pius XII
voiced concern
at the murder of "hundreds of thousands" of "faultless" people because of their "nationality or race" and intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. Upon his death in 1958, Pius was praised emphatically by the Israeli Foreign Minister, and other world leaders. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonored his policy of Vatican neutrality.
[212]
Hitler biographer John Toland, while scathing of Pius's cautious public comments in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, concluded that the Allies' own record of action against the Holocaust was "shameful", while "The Church, under the Pope's guidance, had already saved the lives of more Jews than all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined".
[178]
In 1939, the newly elected Pope Pius XII appointed several prominent Jewish scholars to posts at the Vatican after they had been dismissed from Italian universities under
Fascist
leader
Benito Mussolini
's racial laws.
[213]
In 1939, the Pope employed a Jewish cartographer, Roberto Almagia, to work on old maps in the Vatican library. Almagia had been at the
University of Rome
since 1915 but was dismissed after
Benito Mussolini
's antisemitic legislation of 1938. The Pope's appointment of two Jews to the Vatican Academy of Science as well as the hiring of Almagia were reported by
The New York Times
in the editions of 11 November 1939 and 10 January 1940.
[214]
Pius later engineered an agreement—formally approved on 23 June 1939—with Brazilian
President
Getúlio Vargas
to issue 3,000
visas
to "non-
Aryan
Catholics". However, over the next 18 months, Brazil's Conselho de Imigração e Colonização (CIC) continued to tighten the restrictions on their issuance, including requiring a
baptismal certificate
dated before 1933, a substantial monetary transfer to the
Banco do Brasil
, and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin.
[215]
The program was cancelled 14 months later, after fewer than 1,000 visas had been issued, amid suspicions of "improper conduct" (i.e., continuing to practice Judaism) among those who had received visas.
[58]
[216]
In April 1939, after the submission of
Charles Maurras
and the intervention of the Carmel of
Lisieux
, Pius XII ended his predecessor's ban on
Action Française
, a virulently
antisemitic
organization.
[217]
[218]
Following the German/Soviet invasion of Poland, the Pope's first encyclical,
Summi Pontificatus
reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and rejected antisemitism, quoting scripture singling out the "principle of equality"—with specific reference to Jews: "there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision" and direct affirmation of the Jewish
Revelation on Sinai
.
[219]
[220]
The forgetting of solidarity "imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men" was called "pernicious error".
[160]
Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer "compassion and help" to the victims of the war.
[161]
The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war.

The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.
[163]
Cardinal Secretary of State
Luigi Maglione received a request from
Chief Rabbi
of
Palestine
Isaac Herzog
in the spring of 1940 to intercede on behalf of
Lithuanian
Jews about to be deported to Germany.
[58]
Pius called
Ribbentrop
on 11 March, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews.
[218]
In 1940, Pius asked members of the clergy, on Vatican letterhead, to do whatever they could on behalf of interned Jews.
[222]
In 1941, Cardinal
Theodor Innitzer
of
Vienna
informed Pius of Jewish deportations in Vienna.
[223]
Later that year, when asked by French Marshal
Philippe Pétain
if the Vatican objected to antisemitic laws, Pius responded that the church condemned antisemitism, but would not comment on specific rules.
[223]
Similarly, when
Philippe Pétain
's regime adopted the "Jewish statutes", the
Vichy
ambassador to the Vatican,
Léon Bérard
(a French politician), was told that the legislation did not conflict with Catholic teachings.
[224]
Valerio Valeri
, the
nuncio
to France, was "embarrassed" when he learned of this publicly from Pétain
[225]
and personally checked the information with Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione
[226]
who confirmed the Vatican's position.
[227]
In June 1942, Pius XII personally protested against the mass deportations of Jews from France, ordering the papal nuncio to protest to Pétain against "the inhuman arrests and deportations of Jews".
[228]
In September 1941, Pius XII objected to a
Slovak
Jewish Code,
[229]
which, unlike the earlier Vichy codes, prohibited intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews.
[225]
In October 1941,
Harold Tittmann
, a U.S. delegate to the Vatican, asked the pope to condemn the atrocities against Jews; Pius replied that the Vatican wished to remain "neutral",
[230]
reiterating the neutrality policy that Pius had invoked as early as September 1940.
[224]
In 1942, the Slovak
chargé d'affaires
told Pius that
Slovak
Jews were being sent to concentration camps.
[223]
On 11 March 1942, several days before the first transport was due to leave, the chargé d'affaires in
Bratislava
reported to the Vatican: "I have been assured that this atrocious plan is the handwork of ... Prime Minister (
Tuka
), who confirmed the plan ... he dared to tell me—he who makes such a show of his Catholicism—that he saw nothing inhuman or un-Christian in it ... the deportation of 80,000 persons to Poland, is equivalent to condemning a great number of them to certain death." The Vatican protested to the Slovak government that it "deplore(s) these... measures which gravely hurt the natural human rights of persons, merely because of their race."
[231]
On 18 September 1942, Pius XII received a letter from Monsignor Montini (future
Pope Paul VI
), saying "the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms".
[223]
Later that month,
Myron Taylor
, U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's "moral prestige" was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning that was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil,
Uruguay
, Belgium, and Poland.
[232]
Myron C. Taylor passed a U.S. Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine, which said that Jews from across the
Nazi Empire
were being systematically "butchered". Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information that might "tend to confirm the reports", and, if so, what the Pope might be able to do to influence public opinion against the "barbarities".
[233]
Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to "verify their accuracy". Nevertheless, Maglione stated, "every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people".
[234]
According to
David Kertzer
's
The Pope at War
,
[235]
Monsignor
Domenico Tardini
"told the British envoy to the Vatican in mid-December [1942] that the pope couldn't speak out about Nazi atrocities because the Vatican hadn't been able to verify the information".
[236]
In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration "German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race", Maglione replied that the Vatican was "unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities".
[237]
Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.
[238]
On 14 December 1942, German Jesuit and
German resistance
activist
Lothar König
wrote to Reverend Robert Leiber, the Pope's private secretary and a liaison to the Resistance, to inform him that his sources had confirmed approximately 6,000 Polish and Jewish people were being killed every day in "
SS
-
furnaces
" located in an area of what was then
German-occupied Poland
and is now part of western Ukraine.
[239]
It also referenced the Nazi death camps at
Auschwitz
and
Dachau
.
[239]
Following the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland, Pius XII's
Summi Pontificatus
called for the sympathy of the whole world towards Poland, where "the blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants" was being spilled.
[163]
Pius never publicly condemned the Nazi massacre of 1,800,000-1,900,000 Poles, overwhelmingly Catholic (including 2,935 members of the Catholic clergy).
[240]
[241]
In late 1942, Pius XII advised German and Hungarian bishops to speak out against the massacres on the
Eastern Front
.
[242]
In his 1942 Christmas Eve message, he expressed concern for "those hundreds of thousands, who ... sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race, are marked down for death or progressive extinction.
[243]
On 7 April 1943, Msgr. Tardini, one of Pius XII's closest advisors, advised Pius XII that it would be politically advantageous after the war to take steps to help Slovak Jews.
[244]
In January 1943, Pius XII declined to denounce publicly the Nazi discrimination against the Jews, following requests to do so from
Władysław Raczkiewicz
, president of the Polish
government-in-exile
, and Bishop
Konrad von Preysing
of Berlin.
[245]
According to Toland, in June 1943, Pius XII addressed the issue of mistreatment of Jews at a conference of the
Sacred College of Cardinals
and said: "Every word We address to the competent authority on this subject, and all Our public utterances have to be carefully weighed and measured by Us in the interests of the victims themselves, lest, contrary to Our intentions, We make their situation worse and harder to bear".
[178]
On 26 September 1943, following the German occupation of northern Italy, Nazi officials gave Jewish leaders in Rome 36 hours to produce 50 kilograms (110 lb) of gold (or the equivalent), threatening to take 300 hostages. Then Chief Rabbi of Rome
Israel Zolli
recounts in his memoir that he was selected to go to the Vatican and seek help.
[246]
The Vatican offered to loan 15 kilos, but the offer proved unnecessary when the Jews received an extension.
[247]
Soon afterward, when deportations from Italy were imminent, 477 Jews were hidden in the Vatican itself and another 4,238 were protected in Roman monasteries and convents.
[248]
Eighty percent of Roman Jews were saved from deportation.
[249]
Phayer argues that the German diplomats in Rome were the "initiators of the effort to save the city's Jews", but holds that Pius XII "cooperated in this attempt at rescue", while agreeing with Zuccotti that the pope "did not give orders" for any Catholic institution to hide Jews.
[250]
On 30 April 1943, Pius XII wrote to Bishop
Graf von Preysing
of Berlin to say: "We give to the pastors who are working on the local level the duty of determining if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations ...
ad maiora mala vitanda
(to avoid worse) ... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of the reasons, why We impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see. ... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants."
[251]
On 28 October 1943,
Ernst von Weizsäcker
, the German Ambassador to the Vatican, telegraphed Berlin that "the Pope has not yet let himself be persuaded to make an official condemnation of the deportation of the Roman Jews. ... Since it is currently thought that the Germans will take no further steps against the Jews in Rome, the question of our relations with the Vatican may be considered closed."
[252]
[253]
In March 1944, through the papal nuncio in
Budapest
, Angelo Rotta, the pope urged the
Hungarian
government to moderate its treatment of the Jews.
[254]
The pope ordered Rotta and other papal legates to hide and shelter Jews.
[255]
These protests, along with others from the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, and Britain led to the cessation of deportations on 8 July 1944.
[256]
Also in 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept "emergency passports", although it also took the intervention of the U.S. State Department for those countries to honor the documents.
[257]
The
Kaltenbrunner
Report to Hitler, dated 29 November 1944, against the backdrop of the
20 July 1944 Plot to assassinate Hitler
, states that the Pope was somehow a conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), as being a party in the attempt.
[258]
Jewish orphans controversy
[
edit
]
Main article:
Jewish orphans controversy
In 2005,
Corriere della Sera
published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in war-time France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision "has been approved by the Holy Father". Nuncio
Angelo Roncalli
(who became Pope John XXIII, and was recognized by
Yad Vashem
as
Righteous Among the Nations
) ignored this directive.
[259]
Abe Foxman
, the national director of the
Anti-Defamation League
(ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had undergone a custody battle afterwards, called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant
Vatican Secret Archives
and baptismal records were opened.
[260]
Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine, although the reporting by the
Corriere della Sera
was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives who were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organizations.
[261]
Writings from released Vatican records revealed that Pius XII was personally but secretly involved in hiding the
Finaly children
from their Jewish family in an ultimately failed attempt to keep them Catholic after their secret baptism done against the wishes of their family. The French Catholic Church received very bad press from the affair, and several nuns and monks were jailed for the kidnapping before the children were discovered and spirited away to Israel. Only recently was the Pope's personal involvement revealed.

Bishop
Aloisius Joseph Muench
, Pius XII's post-war liaison to the
Office of Military Government, United States
After World War II, Pope Pius XII focused on material aid to war-torn Europe, an internal internationalization of the Catholic Church, and the development of its worldwide diplomatic relations. His encyclicals,
Evangelii praecones
and
Fidei donum
, issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.
[263]
[264]
Though his language retained old conceptions - Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked 'to forward her work among the heathen multitudes' - in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the 'non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence'.
[265]
In the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII
elevated a number
of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops
Joseph Frings
of Cologne,
Clemens von Galen
of Münster and
Konrad von Preysing
of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated
Nazi Empire
Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop
Johannes de Jong
; Hungarian Bishop
József Mindszenty
; Polish Archbishop
Adam Stefan Sapieha
; and French Archbishop
Jules-Géraud Saliège
. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals
Thomas Tien
of China and
Valerian Gracias
of India - the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the
College of Cardinals
.
[266]
Italian Papal diplomat
Angelo Roncalli
(later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop
Stefan Wyszyński
were others among those
elevated in 1953
.
A German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period - the German Jesuits
Robert Leiber
, Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop
Aloisius Muench
wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority - 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future'.
[267]
He was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's
Catholic Action
movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway.
[268]
Pius XII was rather distrustful of
Alcide de Gasperi
and
Italy's Christian Democrats
, considering the party indecisive and fractious - reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left - represented by the Sicilian priest
Luigi Sturzo
for example - he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against Communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance - an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the
Italian Social Movement
. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if "the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe."

Later life, illness and death

Late years of Pope Pius XII
[

]
Main article:
Late years of Pope Pius XII
A long illness in late 1954 caused the Pope to consider
abdication
. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician,
Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi
, who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.
[270]
Pius underwent three courses of
cellular rejuvenation
treatment administered by
Paul Niehans
, the most important in 1954 when Pius was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. "These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments."
[271]
Pius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as
Julius Döpfner
(35 years) and Karol Wojtyła (later
Pope John Paul II
, 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as "
worker-priests
", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of
Thomism
as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as
phenomenology
or
existentialism
.
[272]
Illness and death

]
Mother
Pascalina Lehnert
, Pius XII's housekeeper and confidant for 41 years, until his death
[17]
Photograph of Pius XII on his deathbed in Castel Gandolfo, taken on 10 October 1958.
With frequent absences from work, Pope Pius XII had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide
Domenico Tardini
, his speechwriter
Robert Leiber
, and his long-serving housekeeper
Sister Pascalina Lehnert
. The Pope still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications.
Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ
was his personal confessor. Sister Pascalina was for forty years his "housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion".
[273]
On Monday, 6 October 1958, at around 8:30 AM (07:30 GMT), he suffered a stroke, weakening him greatly in addition to his other maladies, after having taken ill the previous day after a series of meetings. He received the
Last rites
. However, his condition suitably improved until 8 October when he suffered a second stroke. By the mid-afternoon, his doctors had reported that Pius XII was suffering from a severe cardio-pulmonary collapse and by 3:00 PM (14:00 GMT) believed that his death was imminent. Just before sunset, Pius XII contracted pneumonia and doctors immediately moved to bring in oxygen and blood plasma. His last words were reportedly, "Pray. Pray that this regrettable situation for the church may end". When Pius XII was interred, the small crucifix and rosary that he held in his hands as he died were buried with him.
[274]
On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3:52 AM (02:52 GMT) on Thursday, 9 October, a Feast of Saint Denis of Paris, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute
heart failure
. Domenico Tardini prayed the
Magnificat Anima mea dominum
, the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: "The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself."
[275]
Spain
declared ten days of mourning;
[276]
Italy
declared three days of mourning and the closure of offices and schools as a sign of respect;
[277]
Cuba
declared three days of mourning.
[276]
The Testament of Pope Pius XII was published the month of his death.
[278]
Botched embalming
[
edit
]
The Pope of Mary
: A
Madonna and Child
, added by John Paul II in 1982, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.
Pius XII's physician,
Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi
, reported that the pontiff's body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Oreste Nuzzi.
[279]
Pope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead that it be kept in the same condition "in which God created it".
[280]
According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Nuzzi, an embalmer from
Naples
, used an atypical approach with the embalming procedure.
[280]
In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming of the body of the late pontiff. He claimed to have used the same system of oils and resins with which the body of Jesus Christ was preserved.
[280]
[
clarification needed
]
Galeazzi-Lisi asserted that the new process would "preserve the body indefinitely in its natural state".
[279]
However, whatever chance the new embalming process had of efficaciously preserving the body was obliterated by intense heat in Castel Gandolfo during the embalming process. As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly.
[281]
Galeazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation.
[280]
Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII's body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.
[279]
Funeral
[
edit
]
His funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned "their" pope, who was born in their own city, especially as a hero in the time of war.
[282]
Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later to be
Pope John XXIII
) wrote in his diary on Saturday, 11 October 1958 that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of the late Pius XII.

Canonization of Pope Pius XII
Pope Pius XII's
cause of canonization
was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the
Second Vatican Council
. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared
Venerable
.
[284]
Pope Benedict XVI
did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.
[7]
For Venerable status, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints certifies the "heroic virtues" of the candidate. Making Pius XII as Venerable met with various responses, most centered on the papal words and actions during World War II. Benedict's signature on the decree of heroic virtue was regarded by some as a public relations blunder, though acceptance of Pius XII as a saviour of Europe's Jews is regarded as 'proof of fidelity to the Church, the
pope
and the Tradition' by neoconservative Catholic groups.
[285]
On the other hand, Rabbi
Marvin Hier
, founder and dean at the
Simon Wiesenthal Center
said "there would be a great distortion of history" if Pius XII were canonized.
[286]
Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence, the head of
Sydney's Great Synagogue
, said: "How can one venerate a man who ... seemed to give his passive permission to the Nazis as the Jews were prised from his doorstep in Rome?"
[287]
On 1 August 2013, an anonymous "source who works for the
Congregation for the Causes of Saints
" said
Pope Francis
is considering canonization without a miracle, "us[ing] the formula of
scientia certa
".
[288]
Pope Francis also announced his intention in January 2014 to open the
Vatican Secret Archives
to scholars so that an evaluation of the late pontiff's role in the war can be determined before canonization. This has been met with praise by the Jewish community. However, it was said that it could take up to a year to gather all the documents and then analyze them.
[289]
[290]
[291]
On 26 May 2014 on his way back from the
Holy Land
to
Vatican City
, Pope Francis stated that the late pope would not be beatified because the cause has stalled. Pope Francis stated that he checked the progress of the cause for Pius XII and said that there were no miracles attributed to his intercession, which was the main reason that the cause had halted.
[292]
Father Peter Gumpel stated, on a 12 January 2016 documentary on the late pope, that there was consultation of the Vatican Secret Archives which were carried out in secret; in short it means that there are no controversies surrounding the late pontiff that could impede the potential beatification.
[293]
In that same documentary, the cause's vice-postulator Marc Lindeijer stated that several miracles attributed to the late pope are reported to the postulation every year but the individuals related to the healings do not come forward to enact diocesan proceedings of investigation. Lindeijer explained that this was the reason that the cause has stalled in the past as none have come forward to assist the postulation in their investigations.
[294]
Potential miracle
[
edit
]
Reports from 2014 indicate a potential miracle from the
United States
attributed to the intercession of the late pope that was reported to the postulation. The miracle pertains to a male plagued with severe influenza and pneumonia that could have proven to be fatal; the individual was said to have been healed in full after a novena to Pius XII.

During the war,
Time
credited Pius XII and the Catholic Church for "fighting
totalitarianism
more knowingly, devoutly and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organised power".
[297]
During the war he was also praised editorially by
The New York Times
for opposing Nazi anti-Semitism and aggression.
[298]
According to Paul O'Shea, "The Nazis demonised the Pope as the agent of international Jewry; the Americans and British were continually frustrated because he would not condemn Nazi aggression; and the Russians accused him of being an agent of Fascism and the Nazis."
[299]
On 21 September 1945, the general secretary of the World Jewish Council, Leon Kubowitzky, presented an amount of money to the pope, "in recognition of the work of the Holy See in rescuing Jews from Fascist and Nazi persecutions."
[300]
After the war, in the autumn of 1945, Harry Greenstein from
Baltimore
, a close friend of Chief Rabbi Herzog of
Jerusalem
, told Pius XII how grateful Jews were for all he had done for them. "My only regret", the pope replied, "is not to have been able to save a greater number of Jews".
[301]
Pius XII was also criticised during his lifetime.
Leon Poliakov
wrote in 1950 that Pius XII had been a tacit supporter of
Vichy France
's anti-Semitic laws, calling him "less forthright" than
Pope Pius XI
either out of "Germanophilia" or the hope that Hitler would defeat Communist Russia.
[302]
After Pius XII's death on 9 October 1958 many Jewish organisations and newspapers around the world paid tribute to his legacy. At the
United Nations
,
Golda Meir
, Israel's Foreign Minister, said, "When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict."
[303]
The Jewish Chronicle
(London) stated on 10 October, "Adherents of all creeds and parties will recall how Pius XII faced the responsibilities of his exalted office with courage and devotion. Before, during, and after the Second World War, he constantly preached the message of peace. Confronted by the monstrous cruelties of
Nazism
,
Fascism
and Communism, he repeatedly proclaimed the virtues of humanity and compassion."
[303]
In the Canadian Jewish Chronicle (17 October), Rabbi J. Stern stated that Pius XII "made it possible for thousands of Jewish victims of Nazism and Fascism to be hidden away..."
[303]
In 6 November edition of the Jewish Post in
Winnipeg
, William Zukerman, the former American Hebrew columnist, wrote that no other leader "did more to help the Jews in their hour of greatest tragedy, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, than the late Pope".
[303]
Other prominent Jewish figures, such as Israeli Prime Minister
Moshe Sharett
and Chief Rabbi
Isaac Herzog
expressed their public gratitude to Pius XII.
[304]
Early historical accounts
[
edit
]
Some early works echoed the favourable sentiments of the war period, including Polish historian
Oskar Halecki
's
Pius XII: Eugenio Pacelli: Pope of peace
(1954) and Nazareno Padellaro's
Portrait of Pius XII
(1949).
Pinchas Lapide
, a Jewish theologian and
Israeli
diplomat to
Milan
in the 1960s, estimated controversially in
Three Popes and the Jews
that Pius "was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands".
[305]
Some historians have questioned this
[306]
often cited number, which Lapide reached by "deducting all reasonable claims of rescue" by non-Catholics from the total number of European Jews surviving the
Holocaust
.
[307]
A Catholic scholar, Kevin Madigan, has interpreted this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including that offered by Meir, as less than sincere, an attempt to secure Vatican
recognition of the State of Israel
.

The Deputy
A rare 1899 handwriting of Eugenio Pacelli with text in
Latin
In 1963,
Rolf Hochhuth
's controversial drama
Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel
(
The Deputy, a Christian tragedy
, released in English in 1964) portrayed Pope Pius XII as a hypocrite who remained silent about the Holocaust. The depiction is described as lacking "credible substantiation" by the
Encyclopædia Britannica
.
[309]
Books such as Joseph Lichten's
A Question of Judgment
(1963), written in response to
The Deputy
, defended Pius XII's actions during the war. Lichten labelled any criticism of the pope's actions during World War II as "a stupefying paradox" and said, "no one who reads the record of Pius XII's actions on behalf of Jews can subscribe to Hochhuth's accusation".
[310]
Critical scholarly works like
Guenter Lewy
's controversial
The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany
(1964) also followed the publication of
The Deputy
. Lewy's conclusion was that "the Pope and his advisers—influenced by the long tradition of moderate anti-Semitism so widely accepted in Vatican circles—did not view the plight of the Jews with a real sense of urgency and moral outrage. For this assertion no documentation is possible, but it is a conclusion difficult to avoid".
[311]
In 2002 the play was adapted into the film,
Amen.
. An article on
La Civilità Cattolica
in March 2009 indicated the accusations that Hochhuth's play made widely known originated not among Jews but in the
Communist bloc
. It was on Moscow Radio, on 2 June 1945, that the first accusation directly against Pius XII of refusing to speak out against the exterminations in Nazi concentration camps. It was also the first medium to call him "Hitler's Pope".
[312]
The former high-ranking
Securitate
General
Ion Mihai Pacepa
alleged in 2007 that Hochhuth's play and numerous publications attacking Pius XII as a Nazi sympathizer were fabrications that were part of a
KGB
and Eastern bloc secret services
disinformation
campaign, named
Seat 12
, to discredit the
moral authority
of the church and Christianity in the west.
[313]
Pacepa indicated that he was involved in contacting eastern bloc agents close the Vatican in order to fabricate the story to be used for the attack against the wartime pope.

Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale
In the aftermath of the controversy surrounding
The Deputy
, in 1964,
Pope Paul VI
authorized Jesuit scholars to access the Vatican State Department Archives, which are normally not opened for seventy-five years. Original documents in French and Italian,
Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale
, were published in eleven volumes between 1965 and 1981.
[215]
Pierre Blet also published a summary of the eleven volumes.

Hitler's Pope
and
The Myth of Hitler's Pope
[

Main articles:
Hitler's Pope
and
The Myth of Hitler's Pope
In 1999, British author
John Cornwell
's
Hitler's Pope
criticised Pius XII for his actions and inactions during the Holocaust. Cornwell argued that Pius XII subordinated opposition to the Nazis to his goal of increasing and centralising the power of the Papacy. Further, Cornwell accused Pius XII of anti-Semitism.
[315]
The
Encyclopædia Britannica
described Cornwell's depiction of Pius XII as anti-Semitic as lacking "credible substantiation".
[316]
Kenneth L. Woodward
stated in his review in
Newsweek
that "errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page".
[317]
Paul O'Shea summarized the work by saying it was "disappointing because of its many inaccuracies, selective use of sources, and claims that do not bear any scrutiny. However, [Cornwell] has rendered a service by insisting Pacelli be re-examined thoroughly and placed firmly within the context of his times".
[318]
Five years after the publication of
Hitler's Pope
, Cornwell stated: "I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following
Hitler's Pope
, that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany".
[319]
[320]
[321]
Cornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius XII's
beatification
process as well as to many documents from Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the 75-year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives.
[322]
Susan Zuccotti
's
Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy
(2000) and
Michael Phayer
's
The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930-1965
(2000) and
Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War
(2008) provided further critical, though more scholarly analysis of Pius's legacy.
[323]
Daniel Goldhagen
's
A Moral Reckoning
and
David Kertzer
's
The Pope Against the Jews
denounced Pius, while Ralph McInery and José Sanchez wrote less critical assessments of Pius XII's pontificate.
[324]
In specific riposte to Cornwell's criticism, American Rabbi and historian
David Dalin
published
The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis
in 2005. He reaffirmed previous accounts of Pius having been a saviour of thousands of Europe's Jews. In a review of the book, another Jewish scholar—Churchill biographer,
Martin Gilbert
—wrote that Dalin's work was "an essential contribution to our understanding of the reality of Pope Pius XII's support for Jews at their time of greatest danger. Hopefully, his account will replace the divisively harmful version of papal neglect, and even collaboration, that has held the field for far too long".
[325]
Dalin's book also argued that Cornwell and others were liberal Catholics and ex-Catholics who "exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today" and that Pius XII was responsible for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews.
[326]
A number of other scholars replied with favourable accounts of Pius XII, including
Margherita Marchione
's
Yours Is a Precious Witness
: Memoirs of Jews and Catholics in Wartime Italy
(1997),
Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace
(2000) and
Consensus and Controversy: Defending Pope Pius XII
(2002);
Pierre Blet
's
Pius XII and the Second World War, According to the Archives of the Vatican
(1999); and
Ronald J. Rychlak
's
Hitler, the War and the Pope
(2000).
[323]
[327]
Ecclesiastical historian William Doino (author of
The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII
), concluded that Pius was "emphatically
not
silent".
[328]
Other important works challenging the negative characterization of Pius's legacy were written by
Eamon Duffy
,
Clifford Longley
,
Cardinal Winning
,
Michael Burleigh
, Paul Johnson, and
Denis Mack Smith
.
[324]
In his 2003 book
A Moral Reckoning
,
Daniel Goldhagen
asserted that Pius XII "chose again and again not to mention the Jews publicly.... [In] public statements by Pius XII ... any mention of the Jews is conspicuously absent." In a review of Goldhagen's book,
Mark Riebling
counters that Pius used the word "Jew" in his first encyclical,
Summi Pontificatus
, published on 20 October 1939. "There Pius insisted that all human beings be treated charitably—for, as
Paul
had written to the
Colossians
, in God's eyes "there is neither Gentile nor Jew". In saying this, the Pope affirmed that Jews were full members of the human community—which is Goldhagen's own criterion for establishing 'dissent from the anti-Semitic creed'."
[329]
In
Pius XII, the Hound of Hitler
, Catholic journalist
Gerard Noel
dismissed accusations that Pius was "anti-semitic" or "pro-Nazi", but accused him of "silence" based on fear of retaliation and wrote that "Hitler played the Pope with consummate expertise".
[324]
Ian Kershaw
came to a similar conclusion about Pius's motives.
[330]
He suggested that besides seeking to protect his own church and parishioners, Pius feared that speaking out would worsen the plight of the Jews, though he could have hardly made it worse after 1942. Kershaw called the 1942 Christmas message "a missed opportunity", adding: "Having decided to refer to the genocide, Pius ought to have followed this with a condemnation that was loud, plain and unequivocal." However, he doubted that condemnation from the Pope would have led to Nazi Germany changing course.
[330]
Gerald Steinacher
's
Nazis on the Run
accused Pius of turning a blind eye to the activities of Vatican priests assisting "denazification through conversion", which he said helped ex-Nazi anti-communists to escape justice.
[331]
[332]
A Berlin Jewish couple, Mr. and Mrs. Wolfsson, argued in defense of the pope: "None of us wanted the Pope to take an open stand. We were all fugitives, and fugitives do not wish to be pointed at. The Gestapo would have become more excited and would have intensified its inquisitions. If the Pope had protested, Rome would have become the center of attention. It was better that the Pope said nothing. We all shared this opinion at the time, and this is still our conviction today." There were examples when the Catholic Church reaction to Nazi brutality only intensified SS persecutions of both Jews and the church.
[333]
International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission
[
edit
]
Main article:
International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission
In 1999, in an attempt to address some of this controversy, the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission (Historical Commission), a group of three Catholic and three Jewish scholars was appointed, respectively, by the
Holy See
's Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews (Holy See's Commission) and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC), to whom a preliminary report was issued in October 2000.
[334]
The Commission did not discover any documents, but had the agreed-upon task to review the existing Vatican volumes, that make up the
Actes et Documents du Saint Siège (ADSS)
[335]
The commission was internally divided over the question of access to additional documents from the Holy See, access to the news media by individual commission members, and, questions to be raised in the preliminary report. It was agreed to include all 47 individual questions by the six members, and use them as Preliminary Report.
[336]
In addition to the 47 questions, the commission issued no findings of its own. It stated that it was not their task to sit in judgment of the Pope and his advisors but to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the papacy during the Holocaust.
[337]
The 47 questions by the six scholars were grouped into three parts: (a) 27 specific questions on existing documents,
[338]
mostly asking for background and additional information such as drafts of the encyclical
Mit brennender Sorge
, which was largely written by Eugenio Pacelli.
[339]
(b) Fourteen questions dealt with themes of individual volumes,
[340]
such as the question how Pius viewed the role of the church during the war.
[341]
(c) Six general questions,
[342]
such as the absence of any anti-communist sentiments in the documents.
[343]
The disagreement between members over additional documents locked up under the Holy See's 70-year rule resulted in a discontinuation of the commission in 2001 on friendly terms.
[336]
Unsatisfied with the findings, Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the commission, said the commission "ran up against a brick wall .... It would have been really helpful to have had support from the Holy See on this issue."
[344]
Peter Stanford
, a Catholic journalist and writer, wrote, regarding
Fatal Silence: The Pope, the Resistance and the German Occupation of Rome
(written by Robert Katz; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003):
[The Vatican] still refuses to open all its files from the period—which seems to me to be a conclusive admission of guilt—but Katz has winkled various papers out of God's business address on earth to add to the stash of new information he has uncovered in America in the archives of the Office of Strategic Services. From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised—that is to say, he would be safe—or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him. Far from being a saint, then, he was at best a fool, perhaps an anti-Semite and probably a coward.
[345]
Katz's book also discusses how the Pope's view of the anti-Nazi resistance—as harbingers of Communism—meant he chose not to intervene in the
Ardeatine Caves Massacre
.
[346]
Recent developments
[
edit
]
In
The Real Odessa: How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina
(2002), the Argentine journalist
Uki Goñi
described how the Argentinian government dealt with war criminals who entered Argentina. However, during his research Goñi accidentally stumbled on British Foreign Office documents relating to the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called
post-war "ratlines"
. Goñi found out that the British Envoy
D'Arcy Osborne
had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered "that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators".
[347]
Suzanne Brown-Fleming's
The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience: Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany
(2006) underlines Goñi's findings. Brown-Fleming stated how Pius XII allegedly intervened on behalf of German war criminals (e.g.
Otto Ohlendorf
). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany,
Cardinal Aloisius Muench
.
[348]
Then, Phayer's
Pius XII, the Holocaust, and the Cold War
(2008) utilized documents that were released via
Bill Clinton
's 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the
US National Archives
and
Holocaust Memorial Museum
. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the
Argentine government
and the British Foreign Office. Other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop
Hurley
. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the
Ustaše
regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.
[349]
According to Phayer, "the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions".
[350]
On 19 September 2008, Pope
Benedict XVI
held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war.
[351]
A second conference was held from 6-8 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.
[352]
On 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory. Shortly before and after the Mass, dialectics continued between the Jewish hierarchy and the Vatican as Rabbi Shear Yeshuv Cohen of
Haifa
addressed the Synod of Bishops and expressed his disappointment towards Pius XII's "silence" during the war.
[353]
On 16 June 2009, the
Pave the Way Foundation
announced that it would release 2,300 pages of documents in
Avellino
,
Italy
, dating from 1940 to 1945, which the organisation claims show that Pius XII "worked diligently to save Jews from Nazi tyranny"; the organisation's founder, Krupp, has accused historians of harbouring "private agendas" and having "let down" the public.
[354]
The foundation's research led to the publication of the book
Pope Pius XII and World War II: the documented truth
, authored by Krupp; the book reproduces 225 pages of the new documents produced by the foundation's research.
Mark Riebling
argued in his 2015 book
Church of Spies
that Pius XII was involved in plots to overthrow Hitler from mid-October 1939 and was prepared to mediate a peace between the Allies and the Axis in the event of a regime change in Germany. The courier between the resistance group under
Admiral Canaris
and the Pope was the Bavarian lawyer and Catholic politician
Joseph Müller
.
[355]
Opening of the Vatican Secret Archives
[
edit
]
On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the
appointment
of Pius XII as
Bishop of Rome
,
Pope Francis
announced during an audience for staff of the Vatican Secret Archives on 4 March 2019 that Vatican archival materials pertaining to Pius XII's pontificate will be accessible to scholars beginning on 2 March 2020.
[356]
[357]
While this announcement was welcome by researchers, much of it has been clouded by the role of Pope Pius XII with regard to the Holocaust. However, archival research of this period should inform a much broader shift within global Christianity, from Europe to the global South.
[358]
The Vatican archives have provided many millions of pages and it is expected to take many years to process the findings. As of May 2021, the study of the archive has been inconclusive.
[359]
In January 2022, historian
Michael Feldkamp
announced that he had discovered in the Vatican archives evidence that Pius XII had personally saved at least 15,000 Jews from extermination, and that he had sent a report on the Holocaust to the American government shortly after the
Wannsee Conference
, although they did not believe the pope.
[360]
In June 2022,
David Kertzer
, one of the first historians to have analyzed the archives, published his book
The Pope at War
.
[361]
Kertzer, with the support of thousands of unpublished documents, uncovered the existence of secret negotiations between Hitler and Pius XII already a few weeks after the end of the
conclave
, promoted by Hitler himself with the intention of improving his relations with the Vatican. For his part, Pius XII concentrated his efforts on protecting and improving the situation of the Church in Germany in the face of the
anti-Catholic
policies of the Nazis, although no agreement was reached.
[362]
In September 2023,
Corriere della Sera
published a newly discovered documentation from the Vatican Secret Archive showing that a German Jesuit had informed the pope of
the Holocaust
.

) represents
Sweden
in international
basketball
competition. The national team is controlled by the
Swedish Basketball Federation
.
Sweden has qualified for the
EuroBasket
ten times throughout their history. Their best tournament result was the 11th place finish at the
1995 edition
. The Scandinavian squad has also qualified for the
Olympic Games
once, in
1980
, finishing in 10th place. However, Sweden still seeks qualification for their first appearance to the
FIBA World Cup
.
History
[
edit
]
EuroBasket 1953
[
edit
]
Sweden's
European Basketball Championship
debut came at
EuroBasket 1953
in
Moscow
. Although the Swedes did not fare well in their first tournament appearance. As they lost all seven of their matches to finish in last place in the 17 team tournament.
EuroBasket 1955
[
edit
]
Sweden's second appearance on the continental level came at
EuroBasket 1955
in
Budapest
. The team got off to an demoralizing start by losing to
Switzerland
in their first match. Although Sweden would achieve their first ever win at the EuroBasket against
Luxembourg
in their second match of the preliminary phase. However, they followed it by losing their next two matches in the round as well to
Romania
, and the
Soviet Union
. They finished 4th out of the 5 teams in the group with an (1-3) record, and found themselves in the classification rounds. There, the team once again finished with an (1-3) record in their pool, with their only victory coming against
Denmark
. Two losses in the classification 13th-16th place semifinals and the 15th/16th place final (a rematch against Luxembourg) put Sweden at 16th place of the 18 teams.
Later years
[
edit
]
Sweden qualified for the
EuroBasket
eight more times with their three best finishes coming in
1969
,
1983
and
1995
. They also made their lone
Summer Olympics
appearance in
1980
. But overall the national team has struggled to reach an elite level of consistency to become a serious medal contender at major international tournaments. At some events, however, the team displayed potential. E.g. at the
EuroBasket 2013
they beat the heavily favored former champion
Russia
81-62.

Tridymite
is a high-temperature
polymorph
of
silica
and usually occurs as minute tabular white or colorless pseudo-hexagonal crystals, or scales, in cavities in
felsic
volcanic rocks
. Its
chemical formula
is
Si
O
2
. Tridymite was first described in 1868 and the
type location
is in Hidalgo,
Mexico
. The name is from the
Greek
tridymos
for
triplet
as tridymite commonly occurs as
twinned
crystal
trillings
[2]
(compound crystals comprising three twinned crystal components).
Structure
[
edit
]
Crystal structure of α-tridymite
β-tridymite
Tridymite can occur in seven crystalline forms. Two of the most common at standard pressure are known as α and β. The α-tridymite phase is favored at elevated temperatures (above 870 °C) and it converts to β-
cristobalite
at 1,470 °C.
[4]
[5]
However, tridymite does usually not form from pure β-quartz, one needs to add trace amounts of certain compounds to achieve this.
[6]
Otherwise the β-quartz-tridymite transition is skipped and β-quartz transitions directly to cristobalite at 1,050 °C without occurrence of the tridymite phase.

[5]
Mineralogy handbooks often arbitrarily assign tridymite to the
triclinic
crystal system, yet use hexagonal
Miller indices
because of the hexagonal crystal shape (see image).
[2]
Mars
[
edit
]
In December 2015
, the team behind
NASA
's
Mars Science Laboratory
announced the discovery of large amounts of tridymite in Marias Pass on the slope of
Aeolis Mons
, popularly known as Mount Sharp, on the planet
Mars
.
[7]
This discovery was unexpected given the rarity of the mineral on Earth and the apparent lack of volcanic activity where it was discovered, and at the time of discovery no explanation for how it was formed was forthcoming. Its discovery was serendipitous: two teams, responsible for two different instruments on the
Curiosity
rover
, both happened to report what in isolation were relatively uninteresting findings related to their instruments: the
ChemCam
team reported a region of high silica while the
DAN
team reported high neutron readings in what turned out to be the same area. Neither team would have been aware of the other's findings had it not been for a fortuitous Mars
conjunction
in July 2015, during which the various international teams took advantage of the downtime to meet in
Paris
and discuss their scientific findings.
DAN's high neutron readings would normally have been interpreted as meaning the region was hydrogen-rich, and ChemCam's high-silica readings were not surprising given the ubiquity of silica-rich deposits on Mars, but taken together it was clear that further study of the region was needed. Following conjunction, NASA directed the
Curiosity
rover back to the area where the readings had been taken and discovered that large amounts of tridymite were present. How they were formed remains a mystery.

Onkaparinga River Recreation Park
is a
protected area
occupying land in the estuary of the
Onkaparinga River
in
South Australia
. The recreation park which was established in 1985 is approximately 32 km (20 mi) from
Adelaide city centre
. It is the venue for recreational activities such as
walking
,
canoeing
,
kayaking
,
recreational fishing
and
picnics
.
Description
[
edit
]
The recreation park occupies the majority of the portion of the river's catchment area between
Main South Road
near
Old Noarlunga
in the east and Commercial and Saltfleet Roads at
Port Noarlunga
in the west.
[4]
The occupied land is located within the following suburbs in the
City of Onkaparinga
:
Noarlunga Downs
,
Port Noarlunga South
and
Seaford Meadows
.
[5]
A combined pedestrian/cycle track known as the
Coast to Vines Rail Trail
has an
easement
that passes through the recreation park on its east side following the alignment of the former
Willunga railway line
.
[6]
[7]
The
Seaford railway line
passes over the recreation park on a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) elevated bridge (known as the Onkaparinga Valley Bridge) which was built between 2011 and 2014.
[8]
It is classified as an
IUCN
Category III protected area
.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
Most of the land now dedicated to the recreation park was purchased in the period 1973 to 1977 by a former
SA government
agency, the State Planning Authority. The purpose of the land acquisition which included land along the full length of Onkaparinga River was threefold. Firstly, it was ‘to provide open space for recreational purposes’, secondly, ‘to preserve the natural character of the landscape, including the native flora and fauna’ and thirdly, ‘to function as a buffer between areas of urban and rural land.’ In 1982, the majority of the land was transferred to the then Department for Environment and Heritage which established the recreation park in 1985. In 1993, all of the land east of Main South Road (known as the gorge section’) was reclassified as the
Onkaparinga River National Park
. For managerial and administrative purposes, the recreation park and the national park are known collectively as the ‘Onkaparinga River Reserve’.

sites in the river's estuary suggest continuous use of the land prior to European colonisation for as long ago as 7,500 years
BP
.
[9]
European use
[
edit
]
Land in the locality including the Onkaparinga floodplain was surveyed and became available for
selection
in February 1839. Most of the land in the recreation park was a farm originally purchased about 1861 by John Jared, an immigrant who arrived from
Lincolnshire
,
England
. The original purchase of 240 acres (97 ha) was expanded to 400 acres (160 ha). Jared named the farm ‘Clear Farm’ and built a house on the property in 1862. Jared was succeeded in 1871 by his son, John William, who renamed the property ‘Pringle Farm’. The property remained in the Jared family until the 1970s when it was purchased by the State Planning Authority. The remains of Pringle Farm which was listed on the
South Australian Heritage Register
on 11 April 1996 are conserved within the recreation park.
[9]
[10]
Recreational uses
[
edit
]
The recreation park features a system of
walking tracks
. Two are named and signposted: the Wetlands Walk on the north side of the river and the Pringle Farm Walk on the south side of the river. Canoeing, kayaking and recreational fishing is permitted in the waters of the Onkaparinga River within the recreation park's boundaries.
Dogs
are permitted in the recreation park, but must be kept on a
leash
at all times.
Vehicle parking areas
,
toilets
and a
picnic ground
are provided both within the recreation park and just outside its boundaries.
[7]
A recreational
airfield
of 900 m (3,000 ft) length which is known as the Old Noarlunga Airfield is located in the south east corner of the recreation park. It is leased by two organisations, the South Coast Flying Club Inc and the Noarlunga Model Aero Sports Inc, for flying respectively
vintage aircraft
and
model aircraft
.
[11]
[12]
Associated protected areas
[
edit
]
The full extent of the River Onkaparinga from the recreational park's eastern boundary at Old Noarlunga to its western boundary at Port Noarlunga is part of both the
Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve
and the
Encounter Marine Park
. With respect to the aquatic reserve, the only permitted fishing activity is ‘
line fishing
and hand net fishing for bait shrimp only’.

Beverage of iced tea and lemonade, named after the American golfer
Arnold Palmer
Ingredients
Iced tea
,
lemonade
The
Arnold Palmer
is a non-alcoholic beverage that combines
iced tea
and
lemonade
. The name refers to the professional American golfer
Arnold Palmer
, who was known to often request and drink this beverage combination; some attribute the invention of the beverage to the golfer.
[1]
[2]
[3]
An alcoholic version of the beverage (generally made with vodka) is often referred to as a
John Daly
.
[4]
However,
MillerCoors
began marketing and distributing a commercially available malt-based version of the beverage under the Arnold Palmer Spiked name in early 2018.
[5]
History
[
edit
]
In 2012, an ESPN
30 for 30 Shorts
documentary was produced on the drink, featuring Palmer, beverage experts, a group of
PGA
golfers and comedian
Will Arnett
discussing the drink's history and popularity.
[6]
In the film, Palmer attributes the spreading of the drink's name to an incident in which a woman copied his ordering the drink at lunch after a long day of designing a golf course in
Palm Springs, California
during the late 1960s, saying "I'll have that Arnold Palmer drink, too."
[7]
Palmer preferred three parts unsweetened tea, to one part lemonade, but when mixed equal parts tea and lemonade, the drink is sometimes called a
Half & Half
.
[8]
[9]
According to a waitress at
Augusta National Golf Club
, Palmer ordered his namesake beverage by saying, "I'll have a Mr. Palmer."
[10]
When Palmer visited the
Latrobe Country Club
in his hometown, the staff at the snack shack served the beverage to him or his wife, Kit, without prompting. "Mr. Palmer should never have to order the drink named after him," wrote a former snack shack employee about the club's rules.
[11]
The first mention of the beverage nationally was in the
Rolling Stone
1997 "Hot Issue." Screenwriter Scott Alexander said it was the new "hot drink" and called it the "Half-and-Half." Alexander wrote, "It's half-iced tea and half-lemonade. At any Hollywood lunch, everyone orders it."
[12]
Mass-produced versions
[
edit
]
The drink has been sold under the Arnold Palmer trademark via a licensing arrangement with Innovative Flavors since 2001.
Arizona Beverage Company
began marketing and selling the beverage with Palmer's picture and signature on the bottle in 2002 and has handled distribution ever since.
[13]
The line has expanded to include various flavors including Green Tea, Southern Style Sweet Tea and Pink Lemonade, Zero Calorie, Strawberry, Peach, Mango and Natural Energy. Lemonade combined with iced tea is also sold without the Arnold Palmer trademark by other companies, such as
Nestea
,
[14]
Lipton Brisk
,
Honest Tea
(as Half and Half),
Nantucket Nectars
(as Half and Half),
Country Time
,
[15]
Sweet Leaf
,
[16]
XINGtea,
[17]
Snapple
,
[18]
and
Peace Iced Tea
(as Caddyshack). It has 43 mg of caffeine per 23 oz drink.

Recently, as of April 26, 2021, Chick-fil-A began selling its own version marketed as "Sunjoy."

Australian former professional surfer (born 1963)
Barton Lynch
(born 9 August 1963) is an Australian former professional surfer known for his competitive prowess and style. In 1988, he was crowned
ASP World Tour
Champion. He also won the 1991
Rip Curl Pro
. In 1998, he was inducted into the Australian Surfing Hall of Fame, and in 2000, he was inducted into the Australian Sporting Hall of Fame.
Life and career
[
edit
]
Lynch was born in
Manly
,
New South Wales
on 9 August 1963 and was raised in the nearby
Sydney
suburb of
Whale Beach
.
[1]
The son of a policeman, he started surfing when he was 8 years old. He quickly mastered the tricky, powerful sandbars, which proved to be a training ground for the world stage; the same waves nourished the talents of
Stuart Entwistle
,
Layne Beachley
and
Pam Burridge
.
Lynch emerged from the beach break of Manly with a flexible and gymnastic style and unflappable competitive drive that helped him to a successful junior career, including victories in the Pro Junior, the JJJ Junior and the ASPA ratings. He refined his competitive act into a fluid routine of vertical maneuvers that brought him immediate success on the
ASP World Tour
. He spent 13 consecutive years in the  top 16, earning a reputation as a brilliant tactical competitor as well as a forthright and articulate spokesman for the sport. His greatest competitive moment came in
Hawaii
, where he won both the 1988
Billabong Pro
and the 1988
ASP World Tour
title.
Over the course of his 15-year pro career, Lynch would place in the top 4 a total of 8 times, win 17 world tour events (which included the Op Pro and
Rip Curl Pro
). In 1993, Lynch won the highly competitive ranks of the World Qualifying Series Tour, and in 1995, at the age of 32 won the Rio Surf Pro. Lynch remained competitive until his retirement in 1998.
Post surfing
[
edit
]
After retiring, he added
big wave tow surfing
to his repertoire. In 2006, he teamed up with former rival
Tom Carroll
to tow an historically massive swell that hit Sydney. He created the Surfers Group (a multi-faceted consultancy firm) and was chosen to coach Team Australia for the ISA Surfing Games. In explaining his experience prior to coaching the Games, Lynch said, "I love coaching young Aussies and trying to inject the passion I have to maintain our position as the premier surfing nation". Lynch currently works as an analyst on the commentary team for the World Surf League Championship Tour coverage.
Personal life
[
edit
]
He currently lives in the Sydney suburb of
Avalon
with his wife Holly. He also organizes BL's Blast Off (a pre-junior's surf event held at Sydney's
Palm Beach
).

Allhusen v Whitell
(1867) LR 4 Eq 295 is an
English trusts law
case which lays down a rule of
equity
which requires the
trustee
of a
trust
to strike a fair balance between the
beneficiaries
who are
tenants for life
and those who are
remaindermen
in respect of payment of the debts of an estate.  The life tenant under a
will
is entitled to income earned after the
testator
's
death
, but it often takes some time to ascertain and settle all of those debts.  In the meantime the assets of the estate are earning income for tenant for life, whereas the life tenant should only receive income from the estate net of the debts; the rule in
Allhusen v White
requires the life tenant to make a contribution.

Judgment
[

Page-Wood VC.
The judgment of the Court was given by the Vice Chancellor, Sir
William Page Wood
.
The rule
[
edit
]
The rule was summarised by
Romer LJ
in
Corbett v Commissioners of Inland Revenue
[1938] 1 KB 567 as follows:
For the purposes of adjusting rights as between the tenant for life and the remainderman of a residuary estate, debts, legacies, estate duties, probate duties and so forth, are to be deemed to have been paid out of such capital as the testator's estate as will be sufficient for that purpose, when to that capital is added interest on that capital from the date of the testator's death to the date of payment of the legacy or debt, or whatever it may have been interest, interest being calculated at the average rate of interest
[1]
earned by the testator's estate during the relevant period.
The rule may be excluded by an expression of contrary intent, or where its application would not be appropriate.
[2]
The rule has been described as "complex, fiddlesome and resulting in a disproportionate amount of work and expense"
[3]
and the rule is often either excluded under a well drafted will, or simply ignored.
The Law Commission of England & Wales has consulted on the rule's abolition.

Gordon C. Faber
(April 2, 1931 - August 18, 2014) was an American politician and businessman in the U.S. state of
Oregon
. A native of
Pennsylvania
, he grew up in
Hillsboro, Oregon
. He joined the
U.S. Air Force
during the
Korean War
and was a small business owner before becoming a real estate agent and entering politics. He served on Hillsboro's budget committee and
city council
before serving two terms as mayor from 1993 to 2001.  The Gordon Faber Recreation Complex in the city's northeast corner is named in his honor.
Early life
[
edit
]
Gordon Faber was born on April 2, 1931,
[1]
in
Greensburg, Pennsylvania
to Ben Faber.
[2]
The family moved to Hillsboro, Oregon, in 1934 where he grew up.
[2]
As a boy he was a member of the
Boy Scouts
, but since Hillsboro did not have a city pool he was unable to earn his
swimming merit badge
.
[3]
He attended the local schools and graduated from
Hillsboro High School
in 1949
[4]
before enrolling at
Lewis & Clark College
in neighboring
Portland
.
[2]
Faber attended the school for a year and a half and then joined the
United States Air Force
when the
Korean War
began.
[2]
In the Air Force he was assigned to the Armed Forces Special Weapons project and spent nearly four years with the unit.
[2]
He married Barbara Loftin in 1951,
[5]
and in time the couple had three children (Mark, Rod, and Bob).
[2]
Following his military service he returned to Oregon and college.
[2]
Faber entered
Willamette University
in
Salem
, where he graduated with a degree in economics in 1956.
[2]
He then returned to Hillsboro and worked for his father in the family's plumbing and electrical business that included a retail appliance store.
[2]
[6]
Later he bought out his brother and then father from the business, but sold it in 1985.
[2]
[6]
Faber then worked as a car salesman before entering the real estate field as a sales agent for Barbara Sue Seal Properties.
[2]
He was also a member of Hillsboro's
Rotary International
club, including serving as president from 1984 to 1985.
[7]
Political career
[
edit
]
Faber's political career began when he served on Hillsboro's budget committee.
[2]
In 1981, he joined the city council where he served a four-year term ending in 1985 alongside later mayor
Shirley Huffman
.
[8]
After a two-year absence he returned for a second four-year term in 1987, followed by another term that would have run until 1995.
[2]
[8]
In July 1992, Faber announced he would run for mayor of Hillsboro to replace Huffman, who could not run again due to term limits.
[9]
During the campaign season he openly opposed the
Oregon Citizens Alliance
’s
ballot measure
that was seen as anti-gay rights.
[2]
He ran unopposed and won the election that November, while the ballot measure was defeated.
[2]
Faber took office in 1993, and left the city council at that time after spending ten years on the council.
[10]
Mayor
[
edit

MAX Light Rail in downtown Hillsboro
The Gordon Faber Recreation Complex
As mayor in April 1995, he cast the tie-breaking vote that allowed for the construction of an apartment complex in the Jackson School neighborhood that was opposed by the neighborhood, but allowed by the existing zoning of the property.
[11]
Hillsboro mayors do not hold a vote on the city council, but do break ties. Later state legislators Jim Hill and
Bruce Starr
also voted in favor of allowing the complex, while later mayor Jerry Willey voted against the complex.
[11]
After the vote Faber announced he would not seek a second term as mayor,
[11]
but changed his mind and announced he would run for a second term in July 1996.
[12]
He presided over the ribbon cutting at the apartment complex when it opened in August 1996,
[13]
and later called the vote the toughest decision he had to make as mayor.
[14]
In the November 1996 election he defeated retired sheet metal worker Gordon B. Sherman, winning 84% of the vote.
[14]
[15]
He advocated for the expansion of the
urban growth boundary
, including bringing in the South Hillsboro Reserve area.
[15]
"I view the city as a living, breathing thing. And if it doesn't grow, it dies. I think growth was necessary to keep the town alive and healthy."
[4]
Faber worked to defeat a proposal to site a new women's prison in Hillsboro in 1997. Oregon governor
John Kitzhaber
insisted a prison be built in the
Portland metropolitan area
in either Hillsboro or at the site of the former
Dammasch State Hospital
in
Wilsonville
.
[16]
The Wilsonville location was selected in May 1997,
[17]
though the prison (
Coffee Creek Correctional Facility
) was later built north of the former state hospital.
[18]
Faber joined Kitzhaber in 2000 on a visit to
Japan
, where Faber visited Hillsboro's sister city of
Fukuroi
as well as the headquarters of many of the Japanese-based companies with facilities in Hillsboro.
[19]
On January 2, 2001, he left office and was succeeded by
Tom Hughes
.
[20]
While Faber was mayor, the city grew from approximately 40,000 residents to 72,630 and became the fifth most populous in the state.
[20]
During his tenure the
MAX Light Rail
’s Blue Line opened to Hillsboro, the city created the Ronler Acres urban renewal district that led to a new campus in the city from
Intel
as well as the construction of
Hillsboro Stadium
, and the Hillsboro 2020 Vision plan was created.
[20]
The Gordon Faber Recreation Complex includes the stadium, and is named in his honor.
Later life and family
[
edit
]
After leaving office he planned to learn to play a musical instrument, learn to use a computer, and take some college level history classes.
[20]
Faber suffered a heart attack a few years after leaving office, but survived.
[21]
His marriage to his first wife, Barbara, having ended, Faber remarried in 1990 to B. J. Jeddeloh (also Barbara).
[2]
Faber was known for his sense of humor, which included an episode where he carried an axe while wearing an executioner's hood to the performance review of the city's manager.
[2]
A scholarship is given in his name by the Hillsboro Community Foundation for local students pursuing nursing careers.
[22]
In 2014, he began receiving hospice care at home due to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
.
[23]
Gordon Faber died on August 18, 2014, at home at the age of 83 due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

TuS Koblenz
is a
German association football club
, located in
Koblenz
,
Rhineland-Palatinate
. Fussball Club Deutschland Neuendorf, which was formed in 1911, is viewed as the foundation of the modern club.
History
[
edit
]
Nazi era (1933-1945)
[
edit
]
Logo of predecessor side FV Neuendorf ca. 1931.
The original club was lost in 1917, but in 1919 the successor side Fussball Verein 1911 Neuendorf was assembled out of the former memberships of FCD, Fussball Club Concordia 1910 Neuendorf, and Fussball Club Alemania 1912 Neuendorf, both of which had folded in 1914.
In 1933, FV joined the
Gauliga Mittelrhein
, one of sixteen top flight divisions established with the re-organization of German football in
Nazi Germany
that year. The club was immediately relegated, and in 1934 was joined by Turnverein 1864 Neuendorf, Arbeitersportverein Neuendorf and DJK Neuendorf, to create Turn- und Spielvereinigung Neuendorf. Both ASV and DJK were forced into the merger through the policies of the
Nazi
regime which regarded worker's and church-sponsored clubs as politically undesirable. TuS Neuendorf returned to first division play in 1935 and was in and out of the Gauliga over the next several seasons.
In 1941, the
Gauliga Mittelrhein
was divided into two new divisions: the
Gauliga Köln-Aachen
and the
Gauliga Moselland
. TuS again returned to first division football in the Gauliga Moselland (Gruppe Ost) and this time earned much better results, finishing second in 1942 and then winning their group in 1943 and 1944 before decisively taking the division in single game playoffs in each of these seasons. That put the club into the national playoffs, where they were eliminated in the early going in both appearances. As World War II progressed and Allied armies advanced into Germany, the Gauliga Moselland played progressively shorter schedules until the league finally collapsed and did not play the 1944-45 season.
Postwar
[
edit
]
Historical chart of Koblenz league performance
In the immediate post-war period, the club returned to tier I football in the
Oberliga Südwest
(Gruppe Nord) in 1946 as SpVgg Neuendorf. Resuming their old identity as TuS, they re-appeared in the national playoffs in 1948 even though they had managed only a third-place finish in their division.
1. FC Saarbrücken
had taken second place by finishing three points ahead of TuS and so were entitled to a playoff spot. However, Saarbrücken was one of several teams in the French-occupied
Saarland
which the French were actively working to establish as an independent state or make part of France. This led to Saarland-based German teams being refused permission to play the German national playoffs, and even the participation of a
Saarland national side
in the
1954 World Cup
preliminaries. TuS earned its place that season through politics and advanced as far as the semi-finals before being put out 1-5 by
1. FC Kaiserslautern
.
The club continued to play well through the early and mid-50s, earning additional turns in the national playoffs in 1950 and 1956, but was once again eliminated in both appearances in the early going. By the end of the decade their performance began to slip and in 1959 they were relegated. They returned to the Oberliga Südwest (I) in 1961 but could not now escape the lower half of the table.
Formation of the Bundesliga
[
edit
]
With the formation of the
Bundesliga
in 1963, TuS found itself placed in the second division
Regionalliga Südwest
. In both 1968 and 1969, the club played well enough to participate in the playoff for a Bundesliga spot, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. By the 1970s, they were a third division side, playing in the
Amateurliga Rheinland
, missing opportunities for promotion to the
2. Bundesliga
in playoff rounds in both 1977 and 1978. By 1981, the club had crashed below the third division where they were mired for nearly a decade-and-a-half.
TuS Koblenz
[
edit
]
In 1982, the club adopted the name TuS Koblenz, but the change did little to help their performance, as they lingered in the
Verbandsliga Rheinland
(V). The fortunes of the club improved with their ascent to the fourth division
Oberliga Südwest
(IV) in 1994 where they remained for a decade. An Oberliga Südwest championship in 2004 was followed by a quick ascent through the
Regionalliga Süd
(III) where a second-place finish in 2005-06 earned the club a spot in the
2. Bundesliga
. Their 2006-07 campaign ended with TuS finishing ahead of expectations in 12th place, meriting an unexpected stay on the second level.
Any hopes of further improvement ended in the late stages of the 2007-08 season when TuS was penalized by the deduction of eight points for not providing contracts for
Marko Lomić
and
Branimir Bajić
,
[1]
turning a potential upper table finish into a lesser result. This was later reduced to six points for the actual season and three points for the following season 2008-09.
The club suffered relegation from the 2. Bundesliga in 2009-10 and played for a season in the 3. Liga before withdrawing to the level below for financial reasons.
In 2010 the player
Michael Stahl
scored a goal from 61.5 metres in the
DFB-Pokal
against
Hertha BSC
. His goal was elected to ARD Goal Of The Year 2010. After the 2011-12 season in the
Regionalliga West
TuS
became part of the new
Regionalliga Südwest
for the following year but was relegated from the league in 2015, dropping to the tier five
Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar
. Koblenz won the Oberliga in 2015-16 and made an immediate return to the Regionalliga, but were relegated again at the end of the 2017-18 season.

Railroad tracks in Salchendorf, the HQ of SSI Schaefer is visible on the left side.
The
Schaefer Group
consists of three independent, international companies, that started operations in
Salchendorf
[
de
]
(
Neunkirchen
) in the district
Siegen-Wittgenstein
of
North Rhine-Westphalia
,
Germany
.
The Schaefer Group was the successor of the company Fritz Schaefer GmbH, which was established in 1937. Today, the entrepreneur's sons are in control of these companies, including 16 production facilities on 3 continents and numerous subsidiaries with more than 8,000 employees.
[1]
In February 2020, SSI Scheafer Group named Steffen Bersch as the new CEO. Bersch will join the company on March 1 for a transition period before succeeding current interim CEO Helmut Limberg on April 1.

SSI SCHAEFER - Fritz Schaefer GmbH
[
edit
]
Headquarter of SSI Schaefer
In 1937, Fritz Schaefer started a small company in his garage and produced a selection of sheet metal products. After switching to the serial production of transport boxes and containers, the company was able to expand its business and had to set up a larger facility in Neunkirchen-Salchendorf in 1948. With the death of Fritz Schaefer, his four sons - Hans, Gerhard, Manfred and Theo - took over. After producing boxes for bottled milk for a while, the company then developed fixed storage boxes in 1953, which were originally made from sheet metal, but are now also available in a
plastic
version. This marked the beginning of the company's rapid ascent. The production of shelves started in 1958. In 2000 the company bought SSI Schaefer Noell GmbH (
Giebelstadt
), a supplier of solutions
[
buzzword
]
for intralogistics. SSI Schaefer Peem GmbH (
Graz
,
Austria
), a provider of
order picking
technology, was acquired in 2001. Finally, SSI Schaefer took over Salomon Automation GmbH (
Friesach
near Graz) in 2008, to add logistics software to the portfolio.
Products
[
edit
]
The range of products of SSI Schaefer GmbH can be divided into 5 groups:
Logistics software
: software to control and monitor warehouse operations
Storage and conveyor technology
: High rise racking; platforms; storage and retrieval devices, boxes and containers
Workstation systems
: office-, workshop and business equipment
Logistics systems
: automated storage, conveying and picking systems
Waste management
: waste containers; waste disposal solutions

Schaefer Werke GmbH
[
edit
]
When the mine "Pfannenberger Einigkeit" was closed down in April 1962, the premises were sold to Theo and Manfred Schaefer, sons of the entrepreneur Fritz Schaefer. They established the
Pfannenberg GmbH
, which started producing workbenches. Soon thereafter, the company was renamed
Schäfer Werke KG
and began manufacturing radiators and boilers.
In the early 1970s, a new facility was set up in
Betzdorf
called „Schaefer Ausstattungssysteme“ (Schaefer equipment systems). Here, the company developed and produced cabinets, workbenches and other workplace equipment. Today, this also includes IT-system equipment such as server cabinets and network racks.
In addition to heating technology, a
polyurethane
-covered
keg
was developed in the following of a crisis in 1978. Perforated plates further broadened the range of products. The sales of heating products spiked in 1994, since they were in high demand in Eastern Germany after the fall of the
Berlin Wall
. Another facility was established in Ledec nad Sázavou in the
Czech Republic
in 1995. Since then, Schaefer Sudex is producing containers for beverages and chemicals there. The company set up a fourth facility in
Dresden
in 1995, and rebuilt it in 2002. Finally, in 2005 the company decided to sell the entire heating division to the Turkish company Demir Döküm. The facility in Dresden was taken over by its former manager Christian Michel in 2009 and subsequently renamed Cooolcase GmbH. Today, Schaefer Werke GmbH (including EMW) employs around 700 people at its 3 remaining sites.

Storm Seeker
is the debut album by Norwegian musician
ICS Vortex
, released on 22 August 2011 in Europe and 23 August 2011 in North America.
Album information
[
edit
]
ICS Vortex describes "Storm Seeker" as "a tribute to the fall and rise of my kind. A generation of misfits, born of hippies and raised by Satan."
Regarding the influences that went into the making of the album, ICS Vortex said, "Inspiration is usually drawn from the things that are close to me. I always write in code, it's often doom related, but never ever whiny. The power of the elements, obscure beauty, religion, death and junk are a few favorites. Knowing I am drawn to the power of the dark side, I decided to include lighter topics into the mix this time to separate 'Storm Seeker' from '
Sideshow Symphonies
': 'The Blackmobile' about
Mopar
and 'Aces' about gambling are the result. Love songs, really."
Commented ICS Vortex: "This song [The Blackmobile] was written way back when I still felt black metal was dangerous. Now, totally untrue to all that, it's a tribute to the only beast I ever loved."
[2]
"Storm Seeker" will be released in Europe as initial limited-edition digipak, 180-gram LP and as a digital download. According to a press release, the CD "takes the musical elements from ICS Vortex's 10-plus years of experience with
Dimmu Borgir
as well as the legacy of the classic bands with whom he is still active (
Borknagar
,
Arcturus
, and Lamented Souls), topping things off with his signature clean vocals in order to make 'Storm Seeker' become a perfectly balanced axe, whether a song is cutting fast, or dicing slow."
"Storm Seeker" features appearances by ICS Vortex's former Borknagar bandmate
Asgeir Mickelson
on drums and
Terje "Cyrus" Andersen
(
Susperia
,
Dimmu Borgir
) on some guitar solos. The CD was recorded at Toproom Studio (
Mayhem
,
Tristania
,
Borknagar
) with engineer Børge Finstad and mastered by Peter in de Betou at Tailor Maid Studio (
Arch Enemy
,
Dark Tranquility
,
Dimmu Borgir
) in Sweden.

Halo
and
Metroid
series. The player can use eight weapons that resemble futuristic versions of weapons found in one of Gameloft's previous works,
Modern Combat: Sandstorm
.

Plot
[
edit
]
In the distant future, Earth is no longer able to sustain life, and humans live on artificial satellites called near-orbitals. To protect themselves, the near-orbitals jointly formed a military organization known as the Near Orbital Vanguard Alliance (NOVA).
The protagonist of this story is Captain Kal Wardin, a retired soldier who is forcefully returned to active duty to investigate a missing transport. He is supported by Yelena, a newly created artificial intelligence, and later a starship AI known as Prometheus. He battles against an alien army simply referred to as the xenos, who begin to attack military facilities of NOVA across the planet New Ceres. After multiple occasions of Kal not following orders, the leaders of NOVA delete Yelena and attempt to kill Kal with a hit team, but Kal escapes through a portal to the xenos homeworld to end the invasion.
Upon reaching the planet, Kal learns that the xenos are actually caretakers of an omniscient race of aliens known as the Judgers, whose leader, the Controller, deemed the human race as a threat when the sister ship of the transport vessel entered a portal and crashed into the world below. Kal defeats the controller and confronts the Judgers, who judge him based on the player's actions.
If Kal is committed to saving others, Yelena is restored to life, Prometheus becomes the guardian of mankind and the Judgers' messenger between the two races, and the NOVA leaders are erased from existence for their actions to save themselves rather than the rest of their race.
If Kal doesn't commit to saving others, he is haunted by those he would not save but impresses the Judgers to let him and the rest of humanity live by showing the courage to save others. He is given the title of "Hero of Sagittarius" for his heroics but retires soon after.

is a set of
free and open-source
build tools
for
managed code
under the
Common Language Infrastructure
as well as native
C
and
C++
code. It was first released in 2003 and was a part of
.NET Framework
. MSBuild is included with
Visual Studio
, but can also be run independently through MSBuild's
command-line interface
.
[4]
Overview
[
edit
]
MSBuild is a
build tool
that helps automate the process of creating a software product, including
compiling
the
source code
,
packaging
, testing,
deployment
and creating documentations. With MSBuild, it is possible to build Visual Studio projects and solutions without the Visual Studio
IDE
installed. MSBuild is
free and open-source
.
[5]
MSBuild was previously bundled with
.NET Framework
; starting with
Visual Studio 2013
, however, it is bundled with Visual Studio instead.
[6]
MSBuild is a functional replacement for the
nmake
utility, which remains in use in projects that originated in older Visual Studio releases.
MSBuild acts on MSBuild project files which have a similar
XML
syntax to
Apache Ant
or
NAnt
. Even though the syntax is based upon well-defined
XML schema
, the fundamental structure and operation is comparable to the traditional Unix
make
utility: the user specifies what will be used (typically source code files) and what the result should be (typically a static library, DLL or an executable application), but the utility itself decides what to do and the order in which to carry out the build.
MSBuild can build a project against a supported .NET Framework version of choice. This feature is called "multitargeting". Any given build of a project, however, can only target one version of the framework at a time.
[7]
History
[
edit
]
MSBuild was first created in 2003 targeting
.NET Framework 2.0
for use in
Visual Studio 2005
(codenamed Whidbey)
[8]
and
Windows Vista
(codenamed Longhorn).

This section
may be
confusing or unclear
to readers
. In particular, it is unclear what this section is talking about and what is the nature of, say, a "Target" or "Task". Examples would help.

Target
A
Target
contains a set of tasks for MSBuild to execute. The focus of MSBuild is the result
Target
specified when invoking MSBuild with the project file. This is because a
Project
may contain several
Target
entries, each executed sequentially (and conditionally). Subsequent dependent Targets are executed before the requested Target. The execution flow of the current
Target
can be directed using the following attributes: Condition, BeforeTargets, AfterTargets, & DependsOnTargets. Each Target may be self-contained with the necessary Tasks to complete itself. A Target is typically an action executed on a file, set of files or directory.
Task
A
Task
is a command which is executed in order to complete a Target.
Tasks
are used to group and execute any number of actions during the build process. They are typically implemented in a .NET assembly as a class which inherits from the Task class or implements the ITask interface. Many basic tasks are shipped as part of the .NET Framework,
[14]
and community developed tasks are freely available. Some examples of
Tasks
include copying files, creating directories, or parsing XML.
Properties and Items
MSBuild provides
Properties
and
Items
, which are conceptually equivalent to
make's
macros
. Properties specify static values, whereas Items are usually used to define sets of files or folders on which to perform Tasks. Specifying files on Items is made easy by the support of wildcards.

[1]
is sometimes referred to as the
God of Fire
.
[2]
Prometheus is best known for defying the Olympian gods by
stealing fire
from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge, and more generally,
civilization
.
In some versions of the
myth
, he is also credited with the
creation of humanity from clay
.
[3]
Prometheus is known for his intelligence and for being a
champion
of mankind,
[4]
and is also generally seen as the author of the human arts and sciences.
[5]
He is sometimes presented as the father of
Deucalion
, the hero of the
flood story
.

[8]
The punishment of Prometheus for stealing
fire
from Olympus and giving it to humans is a subject of both ancient and
modern culture
.
Zeus
, king of the
Olympian gods
, condemned Prometheus to eternal torment for his transgression. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle—the emblem of Zeus—was sent to eat his liver (in ancient Greece, the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions). His liver would then
grow back
overnight, only to be eaten again the next day in an ongoing cycle. According to several major versions of the myth, most notably that of
Hesiod
, Prometheus was eventually freed by the
hero
Heracles
.
[9]
[10]
In yet more symbolism, the struggle of Prometheus is located by some at
Mount Elbrus
or at
Mount Kazbek
, two volcanic promontories in the
Caucasus Mountains
beyond which for the ancient Greeks lay the realm of the
barbarii
.
[11]
In another myth, Prometheus establishes the form of
animal sacrifice
practiced in
ancient Greek religion
.
[12]
Evidence of a
cult
to Prometheus himself is not widespread. He was a focus of religious activity mainly at
Athens
, where he was linked to
Athena
and
Hephaestus
, who were the Greek deities of creative skills and technology.
[13]
[14]
In the
Western
classical tradition
, Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving (particularly the quest for scientific knowledge) and the risk of overreaching or
unintended consequences
. In particular, he was regarded in the
Romantic era
as embodying the lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence could also result in tragedy:
Mary Shelley
, for instance, gave
The Modern Prometheus
as the subtitle to her novel
Frankenstein
(1818).
Etymology
[
edit
]
The etymology of the
theonym
prometheus
is debated. The usual view is that it signifies "forethought", as that of his brother
Epimetheus
denotes "afterthought".
[1]
Hesychius of Alexandria
gives Prometheus the variant name of Ithas, and adds "whom others call Ithax", and describes him as the
Herald
of the Titans.
[15]
Kerényi
remarks that these names are "not transparent", and may be different readings of the same name, while the name "Prometheus" is descriptive.
[16]
It has also been theorised that it derives from the
Proto-Indo-European root
that also produces the
Vedic
pra math
, "to steal", hence
pramathyu-s
, "thief",
cognate
with "Prometheus", the thief of fire. The
Vedic myth
of fire's theft by
Mātariśvan
is an analogue to the Greek account.
[17]
Pramant
was the fire-drill, the tool used to create fire.
[18]
The suggestion that Prometheus was in origin the human "inventor of the fire-sticks, from which fire is kindled" goes back to
Diodorus Siculus
in the first century BC. The reference is again to the "fire-drill", a worldwide primitive method of
fire making
using a vertical and a horizontal piece of wood to produce fire by friction.

The Torture of Prometheus
, painting by
Salvator Rosa
(1646-1648)
The oldest record of Prometheus is in
Hesiod
, but stories of
theft of fire
by a trickster figure are widespread around the world. Some other aspects of the story resemble the Sumerian myth of
Enki
(or Ea in later Babylonian mythology), who was also a bringer of civilization who protected humanity against the other gods, including during the great flood,
[20]
as well as created man from clay. While the theory lost favour in the 20th century that Prometheus descends from the Vedic fire bringer
Mātariśvan
, it was suggested in the 19th century and is still supported by some.

Theogony
[

Prometheus depicted in a sculpture by
Nicolas-Sébastien Adam
, 1762 (
Louvre
)
The first recorded account of the Prometheus myth appeared in the late 8th-century BC
Greek
epic poet
Hesiod
's
Theogony
(
). In that account, Prometheus was a son of the
Titan
Iapetus
by
Clymene
or
Asia
, one of the
Oceanids
. He was brother to
Menoetius
,
Atlas
, and
Epimetheus
. Hesiod, in
Theogony
, introduces Prometheus as a lowly challenger to
Zeus
's omniscience and omnipotence.
In the
trick at Mecone
(
), a sacrificial meal marking the "settling of accounts" between mortals and immortals, Prometheus played a trick against Zeus. He placed two
sacrificial
offerings before the Olympian: a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped completely in "glistening fat" (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter, setting a precedent for future sacrifices (
). Henceforth, humans would keep that meat for themselves and burn the bones wrapped in fat as an offering to the gods. This angered Zeus, who hid fire from humans in retribution. In this version of the myth, the use of fire was already known to humans, but withdrawn by Zeus.
[21]
Prometheus stole fire back from Zeus in a
fennel
stalk and restored it to humanity (
). This further enraged Zeus, who sent the first woman to live with humanity (
Pandora
, not explicitly mentioned). The woman, a "shy maiden", was fashioned by
Hephaestus
out of clay and Athena helped to adorn her properly (
). Hesiod writes, "From her is the race of women and female kind: of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no
helpmeets
in hateful poverty, but only in wealth" (
). For his crimes, Prometheus was punished by Zeus, who bound him with chains and sent an eagle to eat Prometheus' immortal liver every day, which then grew back every night. Years later, the Greek hero
Heracles
, with Zeus' permission, killed the eagle and freed Prometheus from this torment (
).
Prometheus Brings Fire
by
Heinrich Friedrich Füger
. Prometheus brings fire to mankind as told by Hesiod, with its having been hidden as revenge for the trick at Mecone.
Works and Days
[
edit
]
Hesiod revisits the story of Prometheus and the theft of fire in
Works and Days
(
). In it the poet expands upon Zeus's reaction to Prometheus' deception. Not only does Zeus withhold fire from humanity, but "the means of life" as well (
). Had Prometheus not provoked Zeus's wrath, "you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste" (
).
Hesiod also adds more information to
Theogony
'
s story of the first woman, a maiden crafted from earth and water by Hephaestus now explicitly called Pandora ("
all gifts
") (
). Zeus in this case gets the help of Athena, Aphrodite, Hermes, the
Graces
and the
Hours
(
). After Prometheus steals the fire, Zeus sends Pandora in retaliation. Despite Prometheus' warning, Epimetheus accepts this "gift" from the gods (
).
Pandora carried a jar with her
from which were released mischief and sorrow, plague and diseases (
). Pandora shuts the lid of the jar too late to contain all the evil plights that escaped, but Hope is left trapped in the jar because Zeus forces Pandora to seal it up before Hope can escape (
).
Interpretation
[
edit
]
Casanova (1979),
[22]
[23]
finds in Prometheus a reflection of an ancient, pre-Hesiodic
trickster
-figure, who served to account for the mixture of good and bad in human life, and whose fashioning of humanity from clay was an Eastern motif familiar in
Enuma Elish
. As an opponent of Zeus, the titan Prometheus can be seen as characteristic of the
titans
in general, and like other titans, was punished for his opposition. As an advocate for humanity he gains semi-divine status at Athens, where the episode in
Theogony
in which he is liberated
[24]
is interpreted by Casanova as a post-Hesiodic interpolation.
[a]
[22]
According to the German classicist
Karl-Martin Dietz
, in Hesiod's scriptures, Prometheus represents the "descent of mankind from the communion with the gods into the present troublesome life".
[25]
The Lost Titanomachy
[
edit
]
The
Titanomachy
is a lost epic of the cosmological struggle between the Greek gods and their parents, the Titans, and is a probable source of the Prometheus myth.
[26]
along with the works of
Hesiod
. Its reputed author was anciently supposed to have lived in the 8th century BC, but
M. L. West
has argued that it can't be earlier than the late 7th century BC.
[27]
Presumably included in the Titanomachy is the story of Prometheus, himself a Titan, who managed to avoid being in the direct confrontational cosmic battle between Zeus and the other
Olympians
against
Cronus
and the other Titans
[28]
(although there is no direct evidence of Prometheus' inclusion in the epic).
[20]
M. L. West notes that surviving references suggest that there may have been significant differences between the Titanomachy epic and the account of events in Hesiod; and that the Titanomachy may be the source of later variants of the Prometheus myth not found in Hesiod, notably the non-Hesiodic material found in the
Prometheus Bound
of
Aeschylus
.
[29]
Athenian tradition
[
edit
]
The two major authors to have an influence on the development of the myths and legends surrounding the Titan Prometheus during the Socratic era of greater Athens were
Aeschylus
and
Plato
. The two men wrote in highly distinctive forms of expression which for Aeschylus centered on his mastery of the literary form of Greek tragedy, while for Plato this centered on the philosophical expression of his thought in the form of the various dialogues he wrote during his lifetime.
Aeschylus and the ancient literary tradition
[
edit
]
Prometheus Bound
, perhaps the most famous treatment of the myth to be found among the
Greek tragedies
, is traditionally attributed to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian
Aeschylus
.
[30]
At the centre of the drama are the results of Prometheus' theft of fire and his current punishment by
Zeus
. The playwright's dependence on the Hesiodic source material is clear, though
Prometheus Bound
also includes a number of changes to the received tradition.
[b]
It has been suggested by
M.L. West
that these changes may derive from the now lost epic
Titanomachy
.
[29]
Before his theft of fire, Prometheus played a decisive role in the
Titanomachy
, securing victory for Zeus and the other Olympians. Zeus' torture of Prometheus thus becomes a particularly harsh betrayal. The scope and character of Prometheus' transgressions against Zeus are also widened. In addition to giving humanity fire, Prometheus claims to have taught them the arts of civilisation, such as writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science. The Titan's greatest benefaction for humanity seems to have been saving them from complete destruction. In an apparent twist on the myth of the so-called Five
Ages of Man
found in Hesiod's
Works and Days
(wherein Cronus and, later, Zeus created and destroyed five successive races of humanity), Prometheus asserts that Zeus had wanted to obliterate the human race, but that he somehow stopped him.
[31]
Heracles freeing Prometheus from his torment by the eagle (
Attic
black-figure
cup, c. 500 BC)
Moreover, Aeschylus anachronistically and artificially injects
Io
, another victim of Zeus's violence and ancestor of Heracles, into Prometheus' story. Finally, just as Aeschylus gave Prometheus a key role in bringing Zeus to power, he also attributed to him secret knowledge that could lead to Zeus's downfall: Prometheus had been told by his mother
Themis
, who in the play is identified with
Gaia
(Earth), of a potential marriage that would produce a son who would overthrow Zeus. Fragmentary evidence indicates that Heracles, as in Hesiod, frees the Titan in the trilogy's second play,
Prometheus Unbound
. It is apparently not until Prometheus reveals this secret of Zeus's potential downfall that the two reconcile in the final play,
Prometheus the Fire-Bringer
or
Prometheus Pyrphoros
, a lost tragedy by Aeschylus.
Prometheus Bound
also includes two mythic innovations of omission. The first is the absence of
Pandora
's story in connection with Prometheus' own. Instead, Aeschylus includes this one oblique allusion to Pandora and her jar that contained Hope (252): "[Prometheus] caused blind hopes to live in the hearts of men." Second, Aeschylus makes no mention of the sacrifice-trick played against Zeus in the
Theogony
.
[30]
The four tragedies of Prometheus attributed to Aeschylus, most of which are lost to the passages of time into antiquity, are
Prometheus Bound
(
Prometheus Desmotes
),
Prometheus Unbound
(
Lyomenos
),
Prometheus the Fire Bringer
(
Pyrphoros
), and
Prometheus the Fire Kindler
(
Pyrkaeus
).
The larger scope of Aeschylus as a dramatist revisiting the myth of Prometheus in the age of Athenian prominence has been discussed by William Lynch.
[32]
Lynch's general thesis concerns the rise of humanist and secular tendencies in Athenian culture and society which required the growth and expansion of the mythological and religious tradition as acquired from the most ancient sources of the myth stemming from Hesiod. For Lynch, modern scholarship is hampered by not having the full trilogy of Prometheus by Aeschylus, the last two parts of which have been lost to antiquity. Significantly, Lynch further comments that although the Prometheus trilogy is not available, the
Orestia
trilogy by Aeschylus remains available and may be assumed to provide significant insight into the overall structural intentions which may be ascribed to the Prometheus trilogy by Aeschylus as an author of significant consistency and exemplary dramatic erudition.
[33]
Harold Bloom
, in his research guide for Aeschylus, has summarised some of the critical attention that has been applied to Aeschylus concerning his general philosophical import in Athens.
[34]
As Bloom states, "Much critical attention has been paid to the question of theodicy in Aeschylus. For generations, scholars warred incessantly over 'the justice of Zeus,' unintentionally blurring it with a monotheism imported from Judeo-Christian thought. The playwright undoubtedly had religious concerns; for instance,
Jacqueline de Romilly
[35]
suggests that his treatment of time flows directly out of his belief in divine justice. But it would be an error to think of Aeschylus as sermonising. His Zeus does not arrive at decisions which he then enacts in the mortal world; rather, human events are themselves an enactment of divine will."
[36]
According to
Thomas Rosenmeyer
, regarding the religious import of Aeschylus, "In Aeschylus, as in Homer, the two levels of causation, the supernatural and the human, are co-existent and simultaneous, two ways of describing the same event." Rosenmeyer insists that ascribing portrayed characters in Aeschylus should not conclude them to be either victims or agents of theological or religious activity too quickly. As Rosenmeyer states: "[T]he text defines their being. For a critic to construct an Aeschylean theology would be as quixotic as designing a typology of Aeschylean man. The needs of the drama prevail."
[37]
In a rare comparison of Prometheus in Aeschylus with Oedipus in Sophocles, Harold Bloom states that "Freud called
Oedipus
an 'immoral play,' since the gods ordained incest and parricide. Oedipus therefore participates in our universal unconscious sense of guilt, but on this reading so do the gods" [...] "I sometimes wish that Freud had turned to Aeschylus instead, and given us the Prometheus complex rather than the Oedipus complex."
[38]
Karl-Martin Dietz
states that in contrast to Hesiod's, in Aeschylus' oeuvre, Prometheus stands for the "Ascent of humanity from primitive beginnings to the present level of civilisation."
[25]
Plato and philosophy
[
edit
]
Olga Raggio
, in her study "The Myth of Prometheus", attributes Plato in the
Protagoras
as an important contributor to the early development of the Prometheus myth.
[39]
Raggio indicates that many of the more challenging and dramatic assertions which Aeschylean tragedy explores are absent from Plato's writings about Prometheus.
[40]
As summarised by Raggio,
After the gods have moulded men and other living creatures with a mixture of clay and fire, the two brothers Epimetheus and Prometheus are called to complete the task and distribute among the newly born creatures all sorts of natural qualities. Epimetheus sets to work but, being unwise, distributes all the gifts of nature among the animals, leaving men naked and unprotected, unable to defend themselves and to survive in a hostile world. Prometheus then steals the fire of creative power from the workshop of
Athena
and Hephaistos and gives it to mankind.
Raggio then goes on to point out Plato's distinction of creative power (
techne
), which is presented as superior to merely natural instincts (
physis
).
For Plato, only the virtues of "reverence and justice can provide for the maintenance of a civilised society - and these virtues are the highest gift finally bestowed on men in equal measure."
[41]
The ancients by way of Plato believed that the name
Prometheus
derived from the Greek
prefix
pro
- (before) +
manthano
(intelligence) and the
agent suffix
-
eus
, thus meaning "Forethinker".
In his dialogue titled
Protagoras
,
Plato
contrasts Prometheus with his dull-witted brother
Epimetheus
, "Afterthinker".
[42]
[43]
In Plato's dialogue
Protagoras
, Protagoras asserts that the gods created humans and all the other animals, but it was left to Prometheus and his brother
Epimetheus
to give defining attributes to each. As no physical traits were left when the pair came to humans, Prometheus decided to give them fire and other civilising arts.
[44]
Athenian religious dedication and observance
[
edit
]
It is understandable that since Prometheus was considered a Titan (distinct from an Olympian) that there would be an absence of evidence, with the exception of Athens, for the direct religious devotion to his worship. Despite his importance to the myths and imaginative literature of ancient Greece, the religious cult of Prometheus during the
Archaic
and
Classical periods
seems to have been limited.
[45]
Writing in the 2nd century AD, the satirist
Lucian
points out that while temples for the major Olympians were everywhere, none for Prometheus is to be seen.
[46]
Heracles freeing Prometheus, relief from the Temple of Aphrodite at
Aphrodisias
Athens was the exception; here Prometheus was worshipped alongside
Athena
and
Hephaestus
.
[47]
The altar of Prometheus in the grove of the
Academy
was the point of origin for several significant processions and other events regularly observed on the
Athenian calendar
. For the
Panathenaic festival
, arguably the most important civic festival at Athens, a torch race began at the altar, which was located outside the sacred boundary of the city, and passed through the
Kerameikos
, the district inhabited by
potters
and other artisans who regarded Prometheus and Hephaestus as patrons.
[48]
The race then travelled to the heart of the city, where it kindled the sacrificial fire on the altar of Athena on the
Acropolis
to conclude the festival.
[49]
These footraces took the form of
relays
in which teams of runners passed off a flaming torch. According to
Pausanias
(2nd century AD), the torch relay, called
lampadedromia
or
lampadephoria
, was first instituted at Athens in honour of Prometheus.
[50]
By the Classical period, the races were run by
ephebes
also in honour of Hephaestus and Athena.
[51]
Prometheus' association with fire is the key to his religious significance
[45]
and to the alignment with Athena and Hephaestus that was specific to Athens and its "unique degree of cultic emphasis" on honouring
technology
.
[52]
The festival of Prometheus was the Prometheia (τὰ Προμήθεια). The wreaths worn symbolised the chains of Prometheus.
[53]
There is a pattern of resemblances between Hephaestus and Prometheus. Although the classical tradition is that Hephaestus split Zeus's head to allow Athena's birth, that story has also been told of Prometheus. A variant tradition makes Prometheus the son of
Hera
like Hephaestus.
[54]
According to that version, the Giant
Eurymedon
raped Hera when she was young, and she had Prometheus. After Zeus married Hera, he threw Eurymedon into Tartarus and punished Prometheus in Caucasus, using the theft of fire as an excuse.
[55]
[56]
Ancient artists depict Prometheus wearing the pointed cap of an artist or artisan, like Hephaestus, and also the crafty hero
Odysseus
. The artisan's cap was also depicted as worn by the
Cabeiri
,
[57]
supernatural craftsmen associated with a mystery cult known in Athens in classical times, and who were associated with both Hephaestus and Prometheus.
Kerényi
suggests that Hephaestus may in fact be the "successor" of Prometheus,  despite Hephaestus being himself of archaic origin.
[58]
Pausanias recorded a few other religious sites in Greece devoted to Prometheus. Both
Argos
and
Opous
claimed to be Prometheus' final resting place, each erecting a tomb in his honour. The Greek city of
Panopeus
had a cult statue that was supposed to honour Prometheus for having created the human race there.
[44]
Aesthetic tradition in Athenian art
[
edit
]
Prometheus' torment by the eagle and his rescue by Heracles were popular subjects in vase paintings of the 6th to 4th centuries BC. He also sometimes appears in depictions of Athena's birth from Zeus' forehead. There was a relief sculpture of Prometheus with Pandora on the base of Athena's cult statue in the Athenian
Parthenon
of the 5th century BC. A similar rendering is also found at the great altar of Zeus at
Pergamon
from the second century BC.
The event of the release of Prometheus from captivity was frequently revisited on Attic and
Etruscan
vases between the sixth and fifth centuries BC. In the depiction on display at the Museum of
Karlsruhe
and in
Berlin
, the depiction is that of Prometheus confronted by a menacing large bird (assumed to be the eagle) with Heracles approaching from behind shooting his arrows at it.
[59]
In the fourth century this imagery was modified to depicting Prometheus bound in a cruciform manner, possibly reflecting an Aeschylus-inspired manner of influence, again with an eagle and with Heracles approaching from the side.
[60]
Other authors
[
edit
]
Creation of humanity by Prometheus as Athena looks on (
Roman-era
relief, 3rd century AD)
Prometheus watches Athena endow his creation with reason (painting by
Christian Griepenkerl
, 1877).
Some two dozen other Greek and Roman authors retold and further embellished the Prometheus myth from as early as the 5th century BC (
Diodorus
,
Herodorus
) into the 4th century AD. The most significant detail added to the myth found in, e.g.,
Sappho
,
Aesop
and
Ovid
[61]
was the central role of Prometheus in the creation of the human race. According to these sources, Prometheus fashioned humans out of clay.
Although perhaps made explicit in the
Prometheia
, later authors such as
Hyginus
, the
Bibliotheca
, and
Quintus of Smyrna
would confirm that Prometheus warned Zeus not to marry the sea nymph
Thetis
. She is consequently married off to the mortal
Peleus
, and bears him a son greater than the father -
Achilles
, Greek hero of the
Trojan War
. Pseudo-Apollodorus moreover clarifies a cryptic statement (1026-29) made by Hermes in
Prometheus Bound
, identifying the centaur
Chiron
as the one who would take on Prometheus' suffering and die in his place.
[44]
Reflecting a myth attested in Greek vase paintings from the Classical period, Pseudo-Apollodorus places the Titan (armed with an axe) at the birth of
Athena
, thus explaining how the goddess sprang forth from the forehead of Zeus.
[44]
Other minor details attached to the myth include: the duration of Prometheus' torment;
[62]
[63]
the origin of the eagle that ate the Titan's liver (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus); Pandora's marriage to Epimetheus (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus); myths surrounding the life of Prometheus' son,
Deucalion
(found in Ovid and
Apollonius of Rhodes
); and Prometheus' marginal role in the myth of
Jason
and the
Argonauts
(found in Apollonius of Rhodes and
Valerius Flaccus
).
[44]
"Variants of legends containing the Prometheus motif are widespread in the
Caucasus
" region, reports Hunt,
[64]
who gave ten stories related to Prometheus from ethno-linguistic groups in the region.
Prometheus finally makes an appearance in Athenian playwright
Aristophanes
's comedy
The Birds
, where he is seen living on
Mount Olympus
after the end of his long torture, apparently having reconciled with the other gods. He is presented not as the dauntless rebel who questioned Zeus, but rather as a timid god who goes to negotiate with the titular Birds disguised, so that Zeus will not notice him talking to the enemy.
[65]
Zahhak
, an evil figure in
Iranian mythology
, also ends up eternally chained on a mountainside - though the rest of his career is dissimilar to that of Prometheus.
[66]
[67]
[68]
Late Roman antiquity
[
edit
]
The three most prominent aspects of the Prometheus myth have parallels within the beliefs of many cultures
[69]
"The Prometheus myth of creation as a visual symbol of the Neoplatonic concept of human nature, illustrated in (many)
sarcophagi
, was evidently a contradiction of the
Christian
teaching of the unique and simultaneous act of creation by the
Trinity
." This Neoplatonism of late Roman antiquity was especially stressed by Tertullian
[70]
who recognised both difference and similarity of the biblical deity with the mythological figure of Prometheus.
The imagery of Prometheus and the creation of man used for the purposes of the representation of the creation of
Adam
in biblical symbolism is also a recurrent theme in the artistic expression of late Roman antiquity. Of the relatively rare expressions found of the creation of Adam in those centuries of late Roman antiquity, one can single out the so-called "Dogma sarcophagus" of the
Lateran Museum
where three figures (commonly taken to represent the theological trinity) are seen in making a benediction to the new man. Another example is found where the prototype of Prometheus is also recognisable in the early Christian era of late Roman antiquity. This can be found upon a sarcophagus of the Church at
Mas d'Aire
[71]
as well, and in an even more direct comparison to what Raggio refers to as "a coarsely carved relief from Campli (
Teramo
)
[72]
(where) the Lord sits on a throne and models the body of Adam, exactly like Prometheus." Still another such similarity is found in the example found on a Hellenistic relief presently in the
Louvre
in which the Lord gives life to
Eve
through the imposition of his two fingers on her eyes recalling the same gesture found in earlier representations of Prometheus.
[69]
In
Georgian
mythology,
Amirani
is a cultural hero who challenged the chief god and, like Prometheus, was chained on the Caucasian mountains where birds would eat his organs. This aspect of the myth had a significant influence on the Greek imagination. It is recognisable from a Greek gem roughly dated to the time of the Hesiod poems, which show Prometheus with hands bound behind his body and crouching before a bird with long wings.
[73]
This same image would also be used later in the Rome of the
Augustan age
as documented by
Furtwangler
.
[74]
In the often cited and highly publicised interview between
Joseph Campbell
and
Bill Moyers
on Public Television, the author of
The Hero with a Thousand Faces
presented his view on the comparison of Prometheus and
Jesus
.
[75]
Moyers asked Campbell the question in the following words, "In this sense, unlike heroes such as Prometheus or Jesus, we're not going on our journey to save the world but to save ourselves." To which Campbell's well-known response was that, "But in doing that, you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes, there's no doubt about it. The world without spirit is a wasteland. People have the notion of saving the world by shifting things around, changing the rules [...] No, no! Any world is a valid world if it's alive. The thing to do is to bring life to it, and the only way to do that is to find in your own case where the life is and become alive yourself." For Campbell, Jesus suffered mortally on the Cross while Prometheus suffered eternally while chained to a rock, and each of them received punishment for the gift which they bestowed to humankind, for Jesus this was the gift of propitiation from Heaven, and, for Prometheus this was the gift of fire from Olympus.
[75]
Significantly, Campbell is also clear to indicate the limits of applying the metaphors of his methodology in his book
The Hero with a Thousand Faces
too closely in assessing the comparison of Prometheus and Jesus. Of the four symbols of suffering associated with Jesus after his trial in Jerusalem (i) the crown of thorns, (ii) the scourge of whips, (iii) the nailing to the Cross, and (iv) the spearing of his side, it is only this last one which bears some resemblance to the eternal suffering of Prometheus' daily torment of an eagle devouring a replenishing organ, his liver, from his side.
[76]
For Campbell, the striking contrast between the New Testament narratives and the Greek mythological narratives remains at the limiting level of the cataclysmic eternal struggle of the eschatological New Testament narratives occurring only at the very end of the biblical narratives in the
Apocalypse of John
(12:7) where, "Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven." This eschatological and apocalyptic setting of a Last Judgement is in precise contrast to the
Titanomachia
of Hesiod which serves its distinct service to Greek mythology as its
Prolegomenon
, bracketing all subsequent mythology, including the creation of humanity, as coming after the cosmological struggle between the Titans and the Olympian gods.
[75]
It remains a continuing debate among scholars of comparative religion and the literary reception
[77]
of mythological and religious subject matter as to whether the typology of suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth finds its more representative comparisons with the narratives of the Hebrew scriptures or with the New Testament narratives. In the
Book of Job
, significant comparisons can be drawn between the sustained suffering of Job in comparison to that of eternal suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth. With Job, the suffering is at the acquiescence of heaven and at the will of the demonic, while in Prometheus the suffering is directly linked to Zeus as the ruler of Olympus. The comparison of the suffering of Jesus after his sentencing in Jerusalem is limited to the three days, from Thursday to Saturday, and leading to the culminating narratives corresponding to
Easter Sunday
. The symbolic import for comparative religion would maintain that suffering related to justified conduct is redeemed in both the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament narratives, while in Prometheus there remains the image of a non-forgiving deity, Zeus, who nonetheless requires reverence.
[75]
Writing in
late antiquity
of the fourth and fifth century, the Latin commentator Marcus
Servius
Honoratus explained that Prometheus was so named because he was a man of great foresight
(vir prudentissimus)
, possessing the abstract quality of
providentia
, the Latin equivalent of Greek
promētheia
(
ἀπὸ τής πρόμηθείας
).
[78]
Anecdotally, the Roman
fabulist
Phaedrus
(c.15 BC - c.50 AD) attributes to
Aesop
a simple
etiology
for
homosexuality
, in Prometheus' getting drunk while creating the first humans and misapplying the genitalia.
[79]
Middle Ages
[
edit
]
Perhaps the most influential book of the Middle Ages upon the reception of the Prometheus myth was the mythological handbook of
Fulgentius Placiades
. As stated by
Raggio
,
[80]
"The text of Fulgentius, as well as that of (Marcus) Servius [...] are the main sources of the mythological handbooks written in the ninth century by the anonymous
Mythographus Primus
and
Mythographus Secundus
. Both were used for the more lengthy and elaborate compendium by the English scholar
Alexander Neckman
(1157-1217), the
Scintillarium Poetarum
, or
Poetarius
."
[80]
The purpose of his books was to distinguish allegorical interpretation from the historical interpretation of the Prometheus myth. Continuing in this same tradition of the allegorical interpretation of the Prometheus myth, along with the historical interpretation of the Middle Ages, is the
Genealogiae
of
Giovanni Boccaccio
. Boccaccio follows these two levels of interpretation and distinguishes between two separate versions of the Prometheus myth. For Boccaccio, Prometheus is placed "In the heavens where all is clarity and truth, [Prometheus] steals, so to speak, a ray of the divine wisdom from God himself, source of all Science, supreme Light of every man."
[81]
With this, Boccaccio shows himself moving from the mediaeval sources with a shift of accent towards the attitude of the Renaissance humanists.
Using a similar interpretation to that of Boccaccio,
Marsilio Ficino
in the fifteenth century updated the philosophical and more sombre reception of the Prometheus myth not seen since the time of
Plotinus
. In his book written in 1476-77 titled
Quaestiones Quinque de Mente
, Ficino indicates his preference for reading the Prometheus myth as an image of the human soul seeking to obtain supreme truth. As Raggio summarises Ficino's text, "The torture of Prometheus is the torment brought by reason itself to man, who is made by it many times more unhappy than the brutes. It is after having stolen one beam of the celestial light [...] that the soul feels as if fastened by chains and [...] only death can release her bonds and carry her to the source of all knowledge."
[81]
This sombreness of attitude in Ficino's text would be further developed later by
Charles de Bouelles
'
Liber de Sapiente
of 1509 which presented a mix of both scholastic and
Neoplatonic
ideas.
Renaissance
[
edit

Mythological narrative of Prometheus by
Piero di Cosimo
(1515)
After the writings of both Boccaccio and Ficino in the late Middle Ages about Prometheus, interest in the Titan shifted considerably in the direction of becoming subject matter for painters and sculptors alike. Among the most famous examples is that of
Piero di Cosimo
from about 1510 presently on display at the museums of Munich and Strasburg (see Inset). Raggio summarises the Munich version
[82]
as follows; "The Munich panel represents the dispute between Epimetheus and Prometheus, the handsome triumphant statue of the new man, modelled by Prometheus, his ascension to the sky under the guidance of
Minerva
; the Strasburg panel shows in the distance Prometheus lighting his torch at the wheels of the Sun, and in the foreground on one side, Prometheus applying his torch to the heart of the statue and, on the other,
Mercury
fastening him to a tree." All the details are evidently borrowed from
Boccaccio
's
Genealogiae
.
The same reference to the
Genealogiae
can be cited as the source for the drawing by
Parmigianino
presently located in the
Morgan Library & Museum
in New York City.
[83]
In the drawing, a very noble rendering of Prometheus is presented which evokes the memory of Michelangelo's works portraying
Jehovah
. This drawing is perhaps one of the most intense examples of the visualisation of the myth of Prometheus from the Renaissance period.
Writing in the late British Renaissance,
William Shakespeare
uses the Promethean allusion in the famous death scene of
Desdemona
in his tragedy of
Othello
. Othello in contemplating the death of Desdemona asserts plainly that he cannot restore the "Promethean heat" to her body once it has been extinguished. For Shakespeare, the allusion is clearly to the interpretation of the fire from the heat as the bestowing of life to the creation of man from clay by Prometheus after it was stolen from Olympus. The analogy bears direct resemblance to the biblical narrative of the creation of life in Adam through the bestowed breathing of the creator in Genesis. Shakespeare's symbolic reference to the "heat" associated with Prometheus' fire is to the association of the gift of fire to the mythological gift or theological gift of life to humans.

Post-Renaissance literary arts
[

For the
Romantic era
, Prometheus was the rebel who resisted all forms of institutional tyranny epitomised by Zeus - church, monarch, and patriarch. The Romantics drew comparisons between Prometheus and the spirit of the
French Revolution
,
Christ
, the
Satan
of
John Milton
's
Paradise Lost
, and the divinely inspired poet or artist. Prometheus is the lyrical "I" who speaks in
Goethe
's
Sturm und Drang
poem
"Prometheus"
(written c. 1772-74, published 1789), addressing God (as Zeus) in
misotheist
accusation and defiance. In
Prometheus Unbound
(1820), a four-act lyrical drama,
Percy Bysshe Shelley
rewrites the lost play of Aeschylus so that Prometheus does not submit to Zeus (under the Latin name
Jupiter
), but instead supplants him in a triumph of the human heart and intellect over tyrannical religion.
Lord Byron
's poem "Prometheus" also portrays the Titan as unrepentant. As documented by Raggio, other leading figures among the great Romantics included Byron,
Longfellow
and
Nietzsche
as well.
[39]
Mary Shelley
's 1818 novel
Frankenstein
is subtitled "The Modern Prometheus", in reference to the novel's themes of the over-reaching of modern humanity into dangerous areas of knowledge.

Prometheus
is a poem by
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
, in which a character based on the mythic Prometheus addresses God (as
Zeus
) in a romantic and
misotheist
tone of accusation and defiance. The poem was written between 1772 and 1774. It was first published fifteen years later in 1789. It is an important work as it represents one of the first encounters of the Prometheus myth with the literary Romantic movement identified with Goethe and with the
Sturm und Drang
movement.
The poem has appeared in Volume 6 of Goethe's poems (in his Collected Works) in a section of
Vermischte Gedichte
(assorted poems), shortly following the
Harzreise im Winter
. It is immediately followed by
"Ganymed"
, and the two poems are written as informing each other according to Goethe's plan in their actual writing.
Prometheus
(1774) was originally planned as a drama but never completed by Goethe, though the poem is inspired by it. Prometheus is the creative and rebellious spirit rejected by God and who angrily defies him and asserts himself.
Ganymede
, by direct contrast, is the boyish self who is both adored and seduced by God. As a high Romantic poet and a humanist poet, Goethe presents both identities as contrasting aspects of the Romantic human condition.
The poem offers direct biblical connotations for the Prometheus myth which was unseen in any of the ancient Greek poets dealing with the Prometheus myth in either drama, tragedy, or philosophy. The intentional use of the German phrase "
Da ich ein Kind war...
" ("When I was a child"): the use of
Da
is distinctive, and with it Goethe directly applies the
Lutheran
translation of
Saint Paul
's
First Epistle to the Corinthians
,
13:11
: "
Da ich ein Kind war, da redete ich wie ein Kind...
" ("When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things"). Goethe's Prometheus is significant for the contrast it evokes with the biblical text of Corinthians rather than for its similarities.
In his book titled
Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence
, C. Kerényi states the key contrast between Goethe's version of Prometheus with the ancient Greek version.
[84]
As Kerényi states, "Goethe's Prometheus had Zeus for father and a goddess for mother. With this change from the traditional lineage the poet distinguished his hero from the race of the Titans." For Goethe, the metaphorical comparison of Prometheus to the image of the Son from the New Testament narratives was of central importance, with the figure of Zeus in Goethe's reading being metaphorically matched directly to the image of the Father from the New Testament narratives.
Percy Bysshe Shelley
[
edit
]
Percy Shelley
published his four-act lyrical drama titled
Prometheus Unbound
in 1820. His version was written in response to the version of myth as presented by Aeschylus and is orientated to the high British Idealism and high British Romanticism prevailing in Shelley's own time. Shelley, as the author himself discusses, admits the debt of his version of the myth to
Aeschylus
and the Greek poetic tradition which he assumes is familiar to readers of his own lyrical drama. For example, it is necessary to understand and have knowledge of the reason for Prometheus' punishment if the reader is to form an understanding of whether the exoneration portrayed by Shelley in his version of the Prometheus myth is justified or unjustified. The quote of Shelley's own words describing the extent of his indebtedness to Aeschylus has been published in numerous sources publicly available.
The literary critic
Harold Bloom
in his book
Shelley's Mythmaking
expresses his high expectation of Shelley in the tradition of mythopoeic poetry. For Bloom, Percy Shelley's relationship to the tradition of mythology in poetry "culminates in 'Prometheus'. The poem provides a complete statement of Shelley's vision."
[85]
Bloom devotes two full chapters in this 1959 book to Shelley's lyrical drama
Prometheus Unbound
.
[86]
Following his 1959 book, Bloom edited an anthology of critical opinions on Shelley for Chelsea House Publishers where he concisely stated his opinion as, "Shelley is the unacknowledged ancestor of
Wallace Stevens
' conception of poetry as the
Supreme Fiction
, and
Prometheus Unbound
is the most capable imagining, outside of
Blake
and
Wordsworth
, that the Romantic quest for a Supreme Fiction has achieved."
[87]
Within the pages of his Introduction to the Chelsea House edition on Percy Shelley, Bloom also identifies the six major schools of criticism opposing Shelley's idealised mythologising version of the Prometheus myth. In sequence, the opposing schools to Shelley are given as: (i) The school of "common sense", (ii) The Christian orthodox, (iii) The school of "wit", (iv) Moralists, of most varieties, (v) The school of "classic" form, and (vi) The Precisionists, or concretists.
[88]
Although Bloom is least interested in the first two schools, the second one on the Christian orthodox has special bearing on the reception of the Prometheus myth during late Roman antiquity and the synthesis of the New Testament canon. The Greek origins of the Prometheus myth have already discussed the
Titanomachia
as placing the cosmic struggle of Olympus at some point in time preceding the creation of humanity, while in the New Testament synthesis there was a strong assimilation of the prophetic tradition of the Hebrew prophets and their strongly eschatological orientation. This contrast placed a strong emphasis within the ancient Greek consciousness as to the moral and ontological acceptance of the mythology of the
Titanomachia
as an accomplished mythological history, whereas for the synthesis of the New Testament narratives this placed religious consciousness within the community at the level of an anticipated
eschaton
not yet accomplished. Neither of these would guide Percy Shelley in his poetic retelling and re-integration of the Prometheus myth.
[89]
To the Socratic Greeks, one important aspect of the discussion of religion would correspond to the philosophical discussion of 'becoming' with respect to the New Testament
syncretism
rather than the
ontological
discussion of 'being' which was more prominent in the ancient Greek experience of mythologically oriented cult and religion.
[90]
For Shelley, both of these reading were to be substantially discounted in preference to his own concerns for promoting his own version of an idealised consciousness of a society guided by the precepts of
High British Romanticism
and
High British Idealism
.
[91]
Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus
[
edit
]
Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus
, written by
Mary Shelley
when she was 18, was published in 1818, two years before Percy Shelley's above-mentioned play.
[92]
It has endured as one of the most frequently revisited literary themes in twentieth century film and popular reception with few rivals for its sheer popularity among even established literary works of art. The primary theme is a parallel to the aspect of the Prometheus myth which concentrates on the creation of man by the Titans, transferred and made contemporary by Shelley for British audiences of her time. The subject is that of the creation of life by a scientist, thus bestowing life through the application and technology of medical science rather than by the natural acts of reproduction. The short novel has been adapted into many films and productions ranging from the early versions with
Boris Karloff
to later versions including
Kenneth Branagh
's
1994 film adaptation
.
Twentieth century
[

Prometheus
(1909) by
Otto Greiner
Franz Kafka
wrote a short piece titled "
Prometheus
," outlining what he saw as his perspective on four aspects of this myth:
According to the first, he was clamped to a rock in the Caucasus for betraying the secrets of the gods to men, and the gods sent eagles to feed on his liver, which was perpetually renewed.
According to the second, Prometheus, goaded by the pain of the tearing beaks, pressed himself deeper and deeper into the rock until he became one with it.
According to the third, his treachery was forgotten in the course of thousands of years, forgotten by the gods, the eagles, forgotten by himself.
According to the fourth, everyone grew weary of the meaningless affair. The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.
There remains the inexplicable mass of rock. The legend tried to explain the inexplicable. As it came out of a substratum of truth it had in turn to end in the inexplicable.
[93]
This short piece by Kafka concerning his interest in Prometheus was supplemented by two other mythological pieces written by him. As stated by
Reiner Stach
, "Kafka's world was mythical in nature, with
Old Testament
and Jewish legends providing the templates. It was only logical (even if Kafka did not state it openly) that he would try his hand at the canon of antiquity, re-interpreting it and incorporating it into his own imagination in the form of allusions, as in 'The Silence of the Sirens,' 'Prometheus,' and 'Poseidon.'"
[94]
Among 20th century poets,
Ted Hughes
wrote a 1973 collection of poems titled
Prometheus on His Crag
. The
Nepali
poet
Laxmi Prasad Devkota
(d. 1949) also wrote an epic titled
Prometheus
(प्रमीथस).
In his 1952 book,
Lucifer and Prometheus
,
Zvi Werblowsky
presented the speculatively derived
Jungian
construction of the character of
Satan
in Milton's celebrated poem
Paradise Lost
. Werblowsky applied his own Jungian style of interpretation to appropriate parts of the Prometheus myth for the purpose of interpreting Milton. A reprint of his book in the 1990s by Routledge Press included an introduction to the book by Carl Jung. Some
Gnostics
have been associated with identifying the theft of fire from heaven as embodied by the fall of
Lucifer
"the Light Bearer".
[95]
Ayn Rand
cited the Prometheus myth in
Anthem
,
The Fountainhead
, and
Atlas Shrugged
, using the mythological character as a metaphor for creative people rebelling against the confines of modern society in
The Fountainhead
and for the punishment given to "Men of Production" for their productivity and ability in
Atlas Shrugged
.
The Eulenspiegel Society
began the magazine
Prometheus
in the early 1970s;
[96]
it is a decades-long-running magazine exploring issues important to
kinksters
, ranging from art and erotica, to advice columns and personal ads, to conversation about the philosophy of consensual kink. The magazine now exists online.

Classical music, opera, and ballet
[
edit

Works of
classical music
,
opera
, and
ballet
directly or indirectly inspired by the myth of Prometheus have included renderings by some of the major composers of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In this tradition, the orchestral representation of the myth has received the most sustained attention of composers. These have included the symphonic poem by
Franz Liszt
titled
Prometheus
from 1850, among his other
Symphonic Poems
(No. 5, S.99).
[99]
Alexander Scriabin
composed
Prometheus: Poem of Fire
, Opus 60 (1910),
[100]
also for orchestra.
[101]
In the same year
Gabriel Fauré
composed his three-act opera
Prométhée
(1910).
[102]
Charles-Valentin Alkan
composed his
Grande sonate 'Les quatre âges'
(1847), with the 4th movement entitled "Prométhée enchaîné" (Prometheus Bound).
[103]
Beethoven
composed the score to a ballet version of the myth titled
The Creatures of Prometheus
(1801).
[104]
An adaptation of Goethe's poetic version of the myth was composed by
Hugo Wolf
,
Prometheus
(
Bedecke deinen Himmel, Zeus
, 1889), as part of his
Goethe
-
lieder
for voice and piano,
[105]
later transcribed for orchestra and voice.
[106]
An opera of the myth was composed by
Carl Orff
titled
Prometheus
(1968),
[107]
[108]
using Aeschylus' Greek language
Prometheia
.
[109]
A tradition has of course grown among critics of finding allusions to
Prometheus Bound
in
Richard Wagner
's
Ring cycle
.
[110]
Rudolf Wagner-Régeny
composed the
Prometheus (opera)
in 1959. Another work inspired by the myth,
Prometeo
(Prometheus), was composed by
Luigi Nono
between 1981 and 1984 and can be considered a sequence of nine cantatas. The libretto in Italian was written by
Massimo Cacciari
, and selects from texts by such varied authors as Aeschylus,
Walter Benjamin
and
Rainer Maria Rilke
and presents the different versions of the myth of Prometheus without telling any version literally.

Description
[
edit
]
The Chon Aike Formation forms part of the Chon Aike Province, also known as the Tobífera Series, a
large igneous province
that covers 1,700,000 square kilometres (660,000 sq mi).
[3]
The northern part of the formation, Río Pinturas, has been dated to the Late Jurassic (140-160
Ma
), while the western and eastern sections have been dated to 162 ± 11 Ma and 168 ± 2 Ma respectively, indicating Middle Jurassic eruptions. Fossil flora, however, suggests a Middle to Late Jurassic age. (See
La Matilde Formation
.)
[4]
During the break-up of
Gondwana
around 180-165 Ma, the opening of the
Weddell Sea
lead to
extension
along the western margin of the
South American Plate
, resulting in intra-plate volcanism in the Chon Aike area and rifting in the
Magallanes Basin
.
[5]
The Chon Aike volcanism was probably related to the subduction of the Pacific
Phoenix
and
Farallon
plates.
[6]
According to Riley, "
Early Jurassic
silicic
volcanic rocks of the Chon Aike Province (V1: 187-182
Ma
) are recognized from many localities in the southern Antarctic Peninsula and northeast Patagonia and are essentially coeval with the extensive
Karoo
(182 Ma) and Ferrar (183 Ma) large igneous provinces of pre-breakup Gondwana.

COMING INTO FORCE
Proclamation of the
Constitution Act, 1867
v
t
e
Section 68 of the
Constitution Act, 1867
(
French
:
article 68 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867
) is a provision of the
Constitution of Canada
relating to the seats of government of the four original provinces,
New Brunswick
,
Nova Scotia
,
Ontario
and
Quebec
.
The
Constitution Act, 1867
is the constitutional statute which established
Canada
.  Originally named the
British North America Act, 1867
, the Act continues to be the foundational statute for the Constitution of Canada, although it has been amended many times since 1867.  It is now recognised as part of the supreme law of Canada.
Constitution Act, 1867
[
edit
]
The
Constitution Act, 1867
is part of the
Constitution of Canada
and thus part of the supreme law of
Canada
.
[1]
It was the product of extensive negotiations by the governments of the
British North American
provinces in the 1860s.
[2]
[3]
The Act sets out the constitutional framework of Canada, including the structure of the
federal government
and
the powers of the federal government and the provinces
.  Originally enacted in 1867 by the
British Parliament
under the name the
British North America Act, 1867
,
[4]
in 1982 the Act was brought under full Canadian control through the
Patriation
of the Constitution, and was renamed the
Constitution Act, 1867
.
[5]
Since
Patriation
the Act can only be amended in Canada, under the amending formula set out in the
Constitution Act, 1982
.
[6]
Text of section 68
[
edit
]
Section 68 reads:
Seats of Provincial Governments
68
Unless and until the Executive Government of any Province otherwise directs with respect to that Province, the Seats of Governments of the Provinces shall be as follows, namely,—of Ontario, the City of Toronto; of Quebec, the City of Quebec; of Nova Scotia, the City of Halifax; and of New Brunswick, the City of Fredericton.
[7]
Section 68 is found in Part V of the
Constitution Act, 1867
, dealing with provincial constitutions.  It has not been amended since the Act was enacted in 1867.
Purpose and interpretation
[
edit
]
National Assembly of Quebec
, Quebec City
Nova Scotia Province House
, Halifax
New Brunswick Legislative Building
, Fredericton
Ontario Legislative Building
, Toronto
Section 68 defines the seats of government of the four original provinces.  The established seats of government of
New Brunswick
and
Nova Scotia
were continued, but seats of government had to be assigned for the two new provinces created by the Act,
Ontario
and
Quebec
.  All four were chosen as seats of government in part for military reasons, with two based on the risk of conflict with the United States.
Quebec City
was the oldest city of the four, but had an interrupted tenure as a provincial capital.  Its military significance was its location at the point where the
St. Lawrence estuary
narrows into the
St. Lawrence River
, which was the cut-off point for large ocean-going warships entering the St. Lawrence.
[8]
[9]
Quebec was the oldest city in
New France
, and had served as the capital of the French
colony of Canada
.  It had also served as the capital of the
British Province of Quebec
(from 1763 to 1791), and then as the capital of
Lower Canada
from 1791 to 1841.  However, after the creation of the
Province of Canada
in 1841,
Kingston
became the first capital of the new province.  Quebec later served as the capital of the Province of Canada from 1852 to 1856, and again from 1859 to 1866.  Quebec became the capital of the new province of Quebec on July 1, 1867.
Halifax
was the second oldest provincial capital, having served as the capital of the
British colony of Nova Scotia
since 1749.  Its
deep harbour
, ice-free year round, made it a valuable port for the
Royal Navy
.  Halifax was one of the
main stations for the Royal Navy
in British North America in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Halifax continued as the capital of the province of
Nova Scotia
after
Confederation
in 1867.
Fredericton
was made the capital of the
British colony of New Brunswick
in 1783.  The site was chosen because it was well-inland, and thus not vulnerable to naval attack from the United States.  It continued as the capital of the
province of New Brunswick
after Confederation.
Toronto
, originally named
York
, had been the second capital of
Upper Canada
.  Newark (now
Niagara-on-the-Lake
) was the first capital of Upper Canada, but the capital was moved to York because Newark was too close to the United States, being just across the Niagara River from
Fort Niagara
,
New York
.
[10]
Even so, York was attacked and occupied by invading American forces during the
War of 1812
, in the
Battle of York
, April 1813.  Before the American invaders left, they burnt down several government buildings, including the provincial Parliament and the Government House, and looted private property.
[11]
In spite of that attack, York continued to be the capital of Upper Canada until the Province of Canada was created, when Kingston became the capital of the new province.  York was renamed Toronto in 1834.  It served as the capital of the Province of Canada from 1849 to 1852, and again from 1856 to 1858.  It became the capital of the new province of Ontario on July 1, 1867.

The
Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra
(also known in English as the
SWR Baden-Baden Freiburg Symphony Orchestra
and in German as the
Sinfonieorchester des Südwestrundfunks
) was a German
radio orchestra
located in the German cities of
Baden-Baden
and
Freiburg
.
History
[
edit
]
Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra, chief conductor François-Xavier Roth
The first incarnation of the orchestra occurred in 1946, initially with members of the discontinued spa orchestra of the city as the core of players. The revival of the spa orchestra two years later forced the reorganization of the radio orchestra. Subsequently,
Hans Rosbaud
was hired as the orchestra's first chief conductor.
Rosbaud
was already well known as a champion of modern music, and Heinrich Strobel, the music director in charge of the orchestra, shared this sympathy with contemporary music. Thus the orchestra had as its focus performances of modern music.
[1]
The orchestra was first sponsored by
Südwestfunk
(SWF), a public broadcasting corporation headquartered in Baden-Baden. In 1998 SWF merged into
Südwestrundfunk
("Southwest Broadcasting"), which took over responsibility for the orchestra. The orchestra's final chief conductor was
François-Xavier Roth
, from 2011 to 2016.
[2]
Michael Gielen
, chief conductor from 1986 to 1999, had the title of
Ehrendirigent
(conductor laureate) with the orchestra.
In June 2012, the SWR Broadcasting Council voted to approve a measure proposed by SWR
Intendant
Peter Boudgoust to merge the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra with the
Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra
, for ostensible reasons of budgetary limitations for two separate orchestras affiliated with the SWR.
[3]
The SWR Broadcasting Council formally passed the measure in September 2012, with the merger of the two orchestras scheduled to occur in 2016.
[4]
Protests at the decision resulted.
[5]
The orchestra made its first, and only, appearance at
The Proms
on 26 August 2015.
[6]
[7]
The orchestra gave its final concert, under the direction of François-Xavier Roth, on 17 July 2016 in Freiburg.
[8]
The name of the new orchestra is
SWR Symphonieorchester
.
One of the most widely heard recordings by this orchestra was
Ligeti's
Atmospheres
conducted by
Ernest Bour
on the
2001: A Space Odyssey
soundtrack. The orchestra has also recorded commercially for the Hänssler label, including music of Messiaen,
[9]
Bartók,
[10]
Stravinsky,
[11]
Schoenberg,
[12]
and
Wolfgang Rihm

The
John Templeton Foundation
(
Templeton Foundation
) is a
philanthropic
organization that reflects the ideas of its founder,
John Templeton
, who became wealthy via a career as a
contrarian investor
, and wanted to support progress in religious and spiritual knowledge, especially at the
intersection of religion and science
.
[3]
He also sought to fund research on methods to promote and develop
moral character
, intelligence, and creativity in people, and to promote free markets.
[4]
In 2008, the foundation was awarded the
National Humanities Medal
.
[5]
In 2016,
Inside Philanthropy
called it "the oddest—or most interesting—big foundation around."
[6]
Templeton founded the organization in 1987 and headed it as chairman until his death in 2008. Templeton's son,
John Templeton Jr.
, served as its president from its founding until his death in 2015, at which point Templeton Jr.'s daughter, Heather Templeton Dill, became president. The foundation administers the annual
Templeton Prize
for achievements in the field of spirituality, including those at the intersection of science and religion.  It has an extensive grant-funding program (around $150 million per year as of 2016)
[7]
aimed at supporting research in physics, biology, psychology, and the social sciences as well as philosophy and theology. It also supports programs related to genetics, "exceptional cognitive talent and genius" and "individual freedom and free markets".
[4]
The foundation has received both praise and criticism for its awards, regarding both the breadth of their coverage, and ideological perspectives asserted to be associated with them.
Leadership
[
edit
]
John Templeton
(29 November 1912 - 8 July 2008) was an American-born British
investor
, banker,
fund manager
, and philanthropist. In 1954, he entered the
mutual fund market
and created the
Templeton Growth Fund
.
[8]
According to a 2011 profile of the foundation:
Like many of his generation, Templeton was a great believer in progress, learning, initiative and the power of human imagination — not to mention the free-enterprise system that allowed him, a middle-class boy from Winchester, Tennessee, to earn billions of dollars on Wall Street. ... Unlike most of his peers, however, Templeton thought that the principles of progress should also apply to religion. He described himself as "an enthusiastic Christian" — but was also open to learning from Hinduism, Islam and other religious traditions. Why, he wondered, couldn't religious ideas be open to the type of constructive competition that had produced so many advances in science and the free market?
[4]
These were the values he sought to promote first through the
Templeton Prize
which he started in 1972 and then through the foundation, which he founded in 1987 and ran until his death in 2008.
[4]
John Templeton Jr.
was president of the foundation from its inception in 1987 and worked as a pediatric surgeon; he was chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1995, when he stopped practicing medicine to join the foundation.
[3]
He took over as chairman when his father died. He was an
evangelical Christian
and supported various
American conservative
causes.
[9]
[10]
He always maintained that he tried to run the foundation according to his father's wishes instead of his own wishes.
[11]
He died in 2015.
[9]
Heather Templeton Dill, the daughter of John Templeton Jr., became president in 2015.
[12]
Endowment
[
edit
]
Templeton bequeathed around $500 million to the foundation when he died in 2008.
[4]
As of 2015
the foundation's total endowment had grown to $3.34 billion.
[3]
The foundation reports that it has issued over 3,300 grants, with over 2,800 of those going to recipients in North America.
[13]
In 2016, the foundation disbursed over $151,000,000 in grants.
[14]
Prizes
[
edit
]
Main article:
Templeton Prize
Mother Teresa
received the inaugural Templeton Prize in 1973.
Marcelo Gleiser
won the Templeton Prize in 2019.
The Templeton Prize was established by
John Templeton
and he administered the prize until the foundation was established in 1987, which took it over.
[4]
[15]
The prize has "a value of about $1.7 million, making it one of the world’s largest annual awards given to an individual".
[3]
The early prizes were given solely to people who had made great achievements in the field of religion;
Mother Teresa
received the inaugural award in 1973,
[4]
with other early winners including Sir
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
(1975),
[16]
Chiara Lubich
(1977),
[17]
and
Nikkyō Niwano
(1979).
[18]
In the 1980s, John Templeton began considering the intersection of science and religion, and after he appointed two scientists to the judging panel, scientists who worked at the intersection began receiving it;
Alister Hardy
was the first, in 1987.
[4]
More recent winners of the Templeton Prize have included the
Dalai Lama
in 2012,
[19]
King Abdullah II of Jordan
in 2018,
[20]
Brazilian Jewish physicist and astronomer
Marcelo Gleiser
in 2019,
[21]
and primatologist
Jane Goodall
in 2021.
[22]
Grants
[
edit
]
Templeton "was a great believer in progress, learning, initiative and the power of human imagination—not to mention the free-enterprise system".
[4]
While most of its funding goes to topics in science, philosophy, and religion, around 40 percent of its annual grants go to character development, genius, freedom and free enterprise, and fields associated with
classical liberalism
. Grants are given to people across all religions, since Templeton believed progress in the field of spirituality could come from anywhere.
[4]
The field of grants was broadened in the 1980s to include scientific fields like neuroscience, psychology, and cosmology, that could be seen as being at the intersection of science and religion.
[4]
Some research programs supported by the foundation have included the development of
positive psychology
by
Martin Seligman
,
Angela Duckworth
and others;
[23]
the
Black Hole Initiative
at
Harvard University
;
[24]
[25]
the
Gen2Gen Encore Prize
; the
World Science Festival
;
[26]
Pew religious demographics surveys;
[27]
and programs that engage with Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant traditions, including support for dialogue with scientists in synagogues,
[28]
and a grant for advancing scientific literacy in
madrasas
.
[29]
[30]
[31]
As of 2015
, the foundation has awarded nearly a billion dollars in grants and charitable contributions, and was the 55th largest grantor among American foundations.

The
Black Hole Initiative
at
Harvard University
received a Templeton Foundation grant of over seven million dollars in 2016.
QISS (Quantum Information Structure of Spacetime
[
edit
]
The John Templeton Foundation granted over two million dollars in 2019, and then 4.5 million dollars in 2022 to QISS.
[33]
[34]
The QISS consortium brings together specialists from
quantum gravity
,
quantum information
,
foundations of quantum mechanics
, as well
Philosophy of Science
to the physics of quantum spacetime on an information theoretical basis, bring within reach empirical access to
quantum gravity phenomenology
leveraging rapidly advancing quantum technologies, and promote interactions between physicists and philosophers. The broader goal of QISS is to establish a long term research program that brings together the  represented communities. Marios Christodoulou and
Carlo Rovelli
are the project leaders.
Black Hole Initiative
[
edit
]
In 2016, the foundation granted over seven million dollars to the
Black Hole Initiative
(BHI), an interdisciplinary program at
Harvard University
that includes the fields of
Astronomy
,
Physics
and
Philosophy
, and is said to be the first center in the world to focus on the study of
black holes
.
[35]
[36]
[37]
Notable principal participants include Sheperd Doeleman,
Peter Galison
,
Avi Loeb
,
Ramesh Narayan
,
Andrew Strominger
, and
Shing-Tung Yau
.
[35]
The BHI Inauguration was held on 18 April 2016 and was attended by
Stephen Hawking
;
[38]
related workshop events were held on 19 April 2016.
[35]
Complexity at the Santa Fe Institute
[
edit
]
In 2015, the
Santa Fe Institute
was awarded a three-year, $2.5 million grant to support the development of a general theory of complexity, constituting "a concise, parsimonious, and potentially mathematizable framework for understanding complex adaptive systems".
[39]
Biology and human development
[
edit
]
A grant of over three million dollars to the
Stone Age Institute
supports the study of what factors led human ancestors to things such as toolmaking.
A 2019 grant supports the study of the distribution of the
Indo-European languages
.
In 2016, the foundation awarded $5.4 million to the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution (FfAME) in order to study the origin of life on Earth, particularly investigating questions of how early RNA interacted with water, which is necessary for life but also degrades RNA, and how the introduction of energy to organic materials yielded life rather than turning it into tar.
[6]
The project is headed by molecular biophysicist and chemist
Steven A. Benner
.
[6]
The foundation also awarded an $8 million grant to a program examining a theory in evolutionary biology called
extended evolutionary synthesis
.
[6]
This project is headed by evolutionary biologist
Kevin Laland
.
[40]
Several grants have specifically supported inquiry into various aspects of human evolution. A 2014 grant of $4.9 million supports an effort at
Arizona State University
by paleoanthropologist
Donald Johanson
to explore how we became human, and a $3.2 million grant to
Indiana University
and the
Stone Age Institute
supports the study of "what factors led human ancestors to develop skills like making tools, developing language, and seeking out information".
[6]
In March 2019, the foundation provided the bulk of a group of grants adding up to over $7 million to enable the Institute for Interdisciplinary Brain and Behavioral Science (The Brain Institute) at
Chapman University
to examine "how the human brain enables conscious control of decisions and actions".
[41]
A grant from the foundation supports a study of religion and health conducted by
Tyler VanderWeele
of
Harvard University
. VanderWeele is the
John L. Loeb
and
Frances Lehman Loeb
Professor of
Epidemiology
in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
, and co-director the University's Initiative on Health, Religion and Spirituality. His research has focused on the application of
causal inference
to epidemiology, as well as on the relationship between
religion and health
.
[42]
[43]
[44]
In June 2019, the foundation awarded one of its largest grants to the Blavatnik Institute at
Harvard Medical School
for its
Ancient DNA
Atlas project that seeks to sequence the DNA of ancient human remains in order to tell the story of human migration and development through the addition of DNA sequences of 10,000 individuals spanning 50,000 years.
[45]
The funding was used to solve a riddle that had puzzled historians, classicists, linguists, anthropologists and archaeologists for 200 years - whether the bulk of the
European civilization
had arrived from
Anatolia
or the
Pontic Steppes
of
Central Asia
, and how
Indo-European
languages
spread
over an enormous geographical area from
Britain
to
India
, becoming the largest
linguistic
group today.
[46]
The funding was used to embrace a multi-disciplinary approach and crowd-source results before the final manuscripts were completed, receiving commentary and feedback from academics of various institutions on several continents, according to geneticist
David Reich
,
[46]
lead researcher on the project. The study was also funded by the governments of the
US
,
Russia
, Germany (
Max Planck Institute
),
European Union
and
India
. Results have been published in

Pew Research Center
[
edit

Main article:
Pew Research Center
The Pew Research Center, an American fact tank or research organization, has been "jointly and generously funded" by
The Pew Charitable Trusts
and the foundation for its studies focusing on demographics of religions in the world, part of the series entitled
Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures
.
[47]
[48]
[27]
Center on Religion and Chinese Society
[
edit
]
The Center on Religion and Chinese Society of the
Purdue University
in
Indiana
is funded by the foundation.
[49]
The current director of the center, the
Chinese American
Christian scholar
Fenggang Yang
, has been granted more than $9.5 million to support his projects,
[50]
The center has published research on
religion in China
, especially based on Yang's own theory of the so-called "religious market", with speculations were based on a report of the Pew Research Center, another publication backed by the foundation.
[51]
Some scholars of Chinese religion have criticized Yang's sociological theories about religion in China,
[52]
[53]
although the
New York Times
has referred to Yang as "a pioneer in the study of the sociology of religion in China",
[54]
and the
Wall Street Journal
has deemed him a "leading scholar on Chinese church-society relation".
[55]
Psychology
[
edit
]
Positive psychology, religion and medicine
[
edit
]
Harold G. Koenig
, Dale Mathews, David Larson, Jeffrey Levin,
Herbert Benson
and
Michael McCullough
are scholars to whom the foundation has provided funds to "report the positive relations" between
religion and medicine
.
[56]
One field in which the foundation has been particularly supportive is
positive psychology
, as developed by
Martin Seligman
,
Angela Duckworth
and others.
[23]
Positive psychology is "the scientific study of  what makes life most worth living",
[57]
or "the scientific study of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels that include the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life".
[58]
Positive psychology is concerned with
eudaimonia
, "the good life", reflection about what holds the greatest value in life - the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. Positive psychology began as a new domain of psychology in 1998 when Seligman chose it as the theme for his term as president of the
American Psychological Association
.
[59]
[60]
Scientific development of virtue interventions
[
edit
]
In 2019, the foundation awarded $2.6 million grant to Sarah Schnitker of
Baylor University
and Benjamin Houltberg of the
University of Southern California
to "galvanize widespread scientific development of virtue interventions for adolescents across a diversity of contexts".
[61]
A grant from the foundation supports a study of religion and health conducted by
Tyler VanderWeele
of
Harvard University
. VanderWeele is the
John L. Loeb
and
Frances Lehman Loeb
Professor of
Epidemiology
in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
, and co-director the University's Initiative on Health, Religion and Spirituality. His research has focused on the application of
causal inference
to epidemiology, as well as on the relationship between
religion and health
.
[42]
[43]
[44]
Science education
[
edit
]
The foundation has provided grants in support of dialogue with scientists in synagogues,
[28]
and a grant for advancing scientific literacy in
madrasas
.
[29]
[30]
[31]
It has also sponsored a major, multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort to integrate science education in North American seminaries, including Mainline Protestant, Evangelical Protestant, and Catholic and Orthodox institutions.
History
[
edit
]
The foundation provided funding for the book
Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion,
which was edited by historian of science
Ronald Numbers
.
[62]
Reception
[
edit
]
The foundation has received both praise and criticism for its awards. The
French National Center for Scientific Research
(CNRS) has been critical of the foundation for funding "initiatives to bring science and religion closer together."
[63]
Science journalist
Chris Mooney
, an atheist, received a 2010 Templeton-Cambridge Journalism Fellowship. In a 2010 article on his
Discover
magazine blog, Mooney wrote, "I can honestly say that I have found the lectures and presentations that we've heard here to be serious and stimulating. The same goes for the discussions that have followed them".
[64]
Some scholars have expressed concerns about the nature of the awards, research projects, and publications backed by the foundation. These concerns include questioning its integrity, cronyism, and its Templeton Freedom Awards. Journalist Sunny Bains pointed out in 2011 that Templeton Freedom Awards are administered by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, a group that opposes taking action on climate change and defends the tobacco industry, which also gives the foundation funding.
[65]
[66]
[67]
[68]
[69]
[70]
Religious funding
[
edit
]
Paul Davies
, physicist and 1995 Templeton Prize laureate, has defended the foundation's role in the scientific community.
Critics have asserted that the foundation has supported Christian-oriented research in the field of the scientific
study of religions
,
[71]
although the foundation has awarded both the Templeton Prize and numerous grants to persons of widely varied religious backgrounds, having provided extensive funding of Islamic scholarship, Buddhist research, and Jewish public engagement.
Wired
magazine has noted that "the scientists who apply to the foundation for support, though, are not required to state their religious beliefs, or to have any".
[72]
In 2006,
John Horgan
, a 2005 Templeton-Cambridge fellow then working as a freelance science journalist, wrote in
The Chronicle of Higher Education
that he had enjoyed his fellowship, but felt guilty that by taking money from the foundation, he had contributed to the mingling of science with religion.
[73]
Horgan stated "misgivings about the foundation's agenda of reconciling religion and science". He said that a conference he attended favored scientists who "offered a perspective clearly skewed in favor of religion and Christianity."
[74]
Horgan fears recipients of large grants from the foundation sometimes write what the foundation wants rather than what they believe.
[74]
Richard Dawkins
, in his 2006 book
The God Delusion
, interprets Horgan as saying that "Templeton's money corrupts science", and characterizes the prize as going "usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something nice about religion".
[75]
Donald Wiebe, scholar of
religious studies
at the
University of Toronto
, similarly criticized the foundation in a 2009 article entitled
Religious Biases in Funding Religious Studies Research?
. According to him, the foundation supports Christian bias in the field of religious studies, by deliberately imposing constraints to steer the results of the research.
[71]
Paul Davies
, physicist and 1995 Templeton Prize laureate, gave a defense of the foundation's role in the scientific community in the
Times Higher Education Supplement
in March 2005.
[76]
In 2010, journalist
Nathan Schneider
published a lengthy investigative article about the foundation, entitled
God, Science and Philanthropy
, in
The Nation
. In the article, he aired complaints about the foundation, but observed that many of its critics and grantees alike failed to appreciate "the breadth of the foundation's activities, much less the quixotic vision of its founder, John Templeton". Schneider observed: "At worst, Templeton could be called heterodox and naïve; at best, his was a mind more open than most, reflective of the most inventive and combinatorial strains of American religious thought, eager to radically reinterpret ancient wisdom and bring it up to speed with some version from the present."
[77]
Though the foundation, in Schneider's view, "has associated itself with political and religious forces that cause it to be perceived as threatening the integrity of science and protecting the religious status quo," these alliances meant the foundation "is also better positioned than most to foster a conservatism—and a culture generally—that holds the old habits of religions and business responsible to good evidence, while helping scientists better speak to people's deepest concerns".
[77]
In 2011, the science journal
Nature
took note of the ongoing controversy among scientists over working with Templeton.
[4]
Jerry Coyne
,
University of Chicago
evolutionary biologist, sees a fundamental impossibility in attempting to reconcile faith with science.
[78]
Coyne told
Nature
writer Mitchell Waldrop that the foundation's purpose is to eliminate the wall between religion and science, and to use science's prestige to validate religion. Other scientists, including Foundation grantees like University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo and Anthony Aguirre, a University of California—Santa Cruz astrophysicist, told
Nature
that they have never felt pressured by Templeton to spin their research toward religion-friendly conclusions.
[4]
Sunny Bains of
University College London
Faculty of Engineering Science claimed that there is "evidence of cronyism (especially in the awarding in those million-dollar-plus Templeton prizes), a misleading attempt to move away from using religious language (without changing the religious agenda), [and] the funding of right-wing anti-science groups".
[79]
Bains feels that grants from the foundation "blur the line between science and religion". Bains' claims have been disputed by Josh Rosenau of the
National Center for Science Education
, who wrote that "the story [Bains] wrote is not convincing", stating that "[k]ey assertions are couched in equivocal language that relies on her judgment or her assumptions, not on any evidence offered to the reader", and that "[o]bvious opportunities for detailed investigation - financial records, grantmaking decisions, interviews with Templeton staff, interviews with grantees, examination of correspondence between grantees and Templeton - are entirely absent".
[80]
Intelligent design
[
edit
]
A 2007 article in the
Los Angeles Times
described the foundation as having "drawn criticism for its early support of intelligent design",
[81]
but by the 2010s, Charles L. Harper Jr., a former senior vice president of the foundation, told
BusinessWeek
that the foundation had become one of the "principal critics" of the intelligent design movement and funded projects that challenged that movement.
[82]
Harper Jr. told
The New York Times
: "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review".
[83]
Some organizations funded by the foundation in the 1990s gave book-writing grants to
Guillermo Gonzalez
and to
William Dembski
, proponents of
intelligent design
who later joined the
Discovery Institute
.
[4]
[84]
The foundation also gave money directly to the Discovery Institute which in turn passed it through to Baylor University, which used the funds to support Dembski's salary at its short-lived
Michael Polanyi Center
.
[85]
: 306
[86]
The foundation funded projects by
Bruce L. Gordon
, associate director of the center, after the center was dissolved.
[87]
Some media outlets described the foundation as a supporter of intelligent design during the
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District
litigation in the mid-2000s, a charge which the foundation denied.
[4]
The foundation "explicitly warns intelligent-design researchers not to bother submitting proposals: they will not be considered."
[4]
[83]
In March 2009, the Discovery Institute accused the foundation of blocking its involvement in
Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories
, a Vatican-backed, Templeton-funded conference in Rome. On the lack of involvement of any speakers supporting intelligent design, the conference director Rev. Marc Leclerc said, "We think that it's not a scientific perspective, nor a theological or philosophical one ... This makes a dialogue difficult, maybe impossible".
[88]
In 2011,
The Times
stated that the Templeton Prize is "explicitly critical of such pseudoscientific gibberish as intelligent design".
[89]
Conservatism
[
edit
]
A number of journalists have highlighted connections with conservative causes. A 1997 article in
Slate
written by
David Plotz
said the foundation had given a significant amount of financial support to groups, causes and individuals considered
conservative
, including gifts to
Gertrude Himmelfarb
,
Milton Friedman
,
Walter E. Williams
,
Julian Lincoln Simon
and
Mary Lefkowitz
, and called John Templeton Jr. a "sugar daddy" for such thinkers.
[90]
The foundation also has a history of supporting the
Cato Institute
, a
libertarian
think-tank and
The Heritage Foundation
conservative
think-tank,
[91]
as well as projects at major research centers and universities such as
Hernando de Soto
's
Instituto Libertad Y Democracia
and the
X Prize Foundation
, which is described as "a nonprofit organization that designs and manages
public competitions
intended to encourage technological development that could benefit humanity".
In a 2007 article in
The Nation
Barbara Ehrenreich
drew attention to the foundation's former president John M. Templeton Jr. funding of the conservative group
Freedom's Watch
, and referred to the foundation as a "right wing venture".
[92]
Pamela Thompson, former Vice President of Communications of the foundation, replied that "the Foundation is, and always has been, run in accordance with the wishes of Sir John Templeton Sr, who laid very strict criteria for its mission and approach", that it is "a non-political entity with no religious bias" and it "is totally independent of any other organisation and therefore neither endorses, nor contributes to political candidates, campaigns, or movements of any kind".
[93]
Climate change denial
[
edit
]
Drexel University
sociologist
Robert Brulle
listed the foundation as among the largest financial contributors to the
climate change denial
movement between 2003 and 2010.
[94]
Templeton Press
[
edit
]
The foundation also funds an affiliated
publisher
, Templeton Press,
[95]
which from 2004 to 2010 published the periodical
In Character: A Journal of Everyday Virtues
.
[96]
From 2000 to 2003 it published
Research news & opportunities in science and theology
,
[97]
in which
Bruce L. Gordon
published a piece on the state of "design theory" in the aftermath of the
Michael Polanyi Center
affair.
[85]
: 378
[98]
Templeton Press has a partnership with the
Yale University Press
, producing books on character and on Foundational Questions in Science.

The
Guiana United Muslim Party
(
GUMP
) was a
Muslim political party
in
Guyana
.
History
[
edit
]
The party was set up in 1964 with assistance from the
CIA
and the British authorities, and was led by Hoosein Ganie.
[1]
[2]
The American and British governments hoped the new party, together with the
Justice Party
(which the CIA was also funding), would take votes from the
People's Progressive Party
(PPP), whose left-wing leanings they were concerned about.
[3]
Although the CIA estimated that the Justice Party and GUMP could win three seats in the
1964 general elections
,
[1]
neither did; GUMP received only 0.5% of the vote and failed to win a seat,
[4]
whilst the PPP emerged as the largest party, but was unable to form a government.
In the
1968 elections
it received only 0.3% of the vote and again failed to win a seat. The party did not contest any further elections.

The club joined the
Central Alliance
in 1949 and finished 3rd in their opening season.
[1]
They left the Alliance in 1957 after struggling at the bottom of the table for three years -
Matlock Town
's record win is their 11-0 win over British Ropes in February 1957.
[2]
The club joined the
Yorkshire Football League
in 1958 but after three years in Division Two they resigned from that league too.

Paraguayan lawyer and feminist
Virginia Carlota Corvalán
was a Paraguayan lawyer and feminist. She was born on 9 February 1900 in
Asunción
, Paraguay, to Miguel Corvalán and Ana Casco. She studied at the National College, graduating in 1918, and was the only woman of the 40 graduates in that term.
[1]
Between 1919 and 1921, she was actively campaigning for women's rights. She was a co-founder and participant in the Centro Feminista Paraguayo (Paraguayan Feminist Center), which was pushing for passage of the draft law on equal rights between men and women, introduced by deputy Telémaco Silvera.
[2]
The Center was the first feminist organization in Paraguay and
[3]
included members such as
Serafina Dávalos
, Carmen Garcete, Carmen Gatti, Felicidad González, Adela Ibáñez, Ermelinda Ortiz, Sabrina Sapena Pastor, Catalina Steward, and Elida Ugarriza, among many others.
[4]
Corvalán went on to study law and obtained a doctorate of law and social sciences in 1923, becoming the second woman in Paraguay to hold the distinction. Her thesis, entitled "
Femininismo: La causa de la mujer en el Paraguay
" (Feminism, the cause of women in Paraguay), was published in 1925, and argued from a feminist perspective women's equality in intelligence and virtue, establishing a foundation as to why they should have the right to vote.
[1]
She argued that while men were heroes for their participation in war, the sacrifices of women for the country were unrecognized.
[2]
In 1926 she married Dr. Peter Larán.
[2]
During the
Chaco War
, Larán was a Judge Advocate General in the Comanchaco and Corvalán served as his assistant. After the war ended in 1936, she became the Minister of the Women's Union of Paraguay.
[1]
Corvalán often linked feminism with socialism focusing on worker's issues. She spoke German, French and English in addition to her native tongue, which allowed her to serve as the legal representative for the Cinema Splendid of the House Pretán of Paris and the German Colony of Paraguay.

The
Union of Russian Patriots
(
Russian
:
Союз русских патриотов
) was an organization of Russian (
White
) emigres living in
France
. The organization was pro-
Soviet
and was active from 1943 to 1948.
When
Germany invaded the USSR
, the occupation authorities started with massive arrests of Russian emigres residing in France, e.g.
Dmitry Odinets
.
[1]
Many Russians participated in the
French resistance
movement, and a number of those founded the Union of Russian Patriots on 3 October 1943 in collaboration with the
French Communist Party
.
[2]
The union published the newspaper
Russian Patriot
. After the
Liberation of France
the organization was renamed the Union of Soviet Patriots («Союз советских патриотов») and the newspaper was consequently renamed
Soviet Patriot
. The activities of the Union proceeded with contacts with the Soviet
consulate general
in Paris. At that time, the membership of the Union was estimated to be 6,500.
[3]
After the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR published the decree on reinstating Soviet citizenship for former subject of the Russian Empire living in France,
[4]
many White emigres (including the overwhelming majority of the members of the Union) decided to apply for Soviet passports.
Thereafter, the Union itself was again renamed, this time becoming the Union of Soviet Citizens in France (
Союз советских граждан во Франции
). Against the backdrop of the
Cold War
, in 1947 the French authorities arrested and expelled most of the Union's leaders from France (among them
Lev Lyubimov
). On 16 January 1948 the Union was closed on the order of the French internal minister. In March 1948, all participants of a gathering of the board of the Union were arrested and deported to the
Soviet occupation zone
in Germany.

American painter
Theora Hamblett
Born
(
1895-01-15
)
January 15, 1895
Paris, Mississippi
, U.S.
Died
March 6, 1977
(1977-03-06)
(aged 82)
Englewood, New Jersey
, U.S.
Nationality
American
Known for
folk art
Theora Hamblett
(January 15, 1895 - March 6, 1977) was an American painter, one of the first Mississippi
folk artists
to achieve national prominence.
[1]
Hamblett's paintings can be divided into three categories: memory paintings, dream paintings, and landscape paintings.
[2]
Early life
[
edit
]
Theora Alton Hamblett was born 15 January 1895, in
Paris, Mississippi
. Her father Samuel was a Civil War veteran, who was 72 years old when Theora was born. She was           educated at Lafayette County Agricultural High School and at Blue Mountain College. .
[3]
Hamblett was raised in a very religious household and rotated between
Methodist
and
Baptist
churches.
[2]
Theora Hamblett became interested in painting at a young age, though she did not start taking painting classes until later in her life at age fifty-five. Carol Crown states that when Hamblett was eight years old, she was given crayons as a present which could have stimulated her interest in painting.
[2]
Hamblett was a teacher in her early adulthood; she left the classroom in 1931, and cared for her dying mother for several years.  In 1939 she bought a house in
Oxford, Mississippi
, where she lived and rented rooms to students.  In her mid-fifties, she took her first nighttime painting class at the
University of Mississippi
.  She also took correspondence courses on art.
[4]
Symbolism
[
edit
]
Hamblett uses many symbols in her artwork. Hamblett's paintings are colorful and frequently harken back to her childhood on a farm, or depict stories from the Bible.  Some represent Hamblett's dreams or visions, frequently with
religious symbolism
(angels, chariots, butterflies, stairways, roses).
[5]
[6]
Butterflies in Hamblett's paintings represent
resurrection
and the soul.  A rose in Hamblett's art symbolizes love, martyrdom, or The Virgin Mary.
[7]
The color yellow represents divinity or God in Hamblett's art. Silver symbolizes the death of the body in Hamblett's paintings.
[5]
In 1954, Hamblett  broke her hip in an accident and needed surgery.  While she was in the hospital, Hamblett began to paint her visions. Many of her dreams were religious in nature.  Hamblett did not sell many of these paintings because they were intimate and personal.
[8]
Style and technique
[
edit
]
Theora Hamblett's artwork is characterized by vibrant colors.  She has a unique style of creating trees in her artwork which is easily recognizable by fans of her art.  She had a specific method of layering colors in the individual leaves so that they shine with bright colors.  She layered each single leaf on the art piece to make the trees the central focus of her paintings.   Hamblett painted landscape scenes of all four seasons, but she was extremely fond of autumn because of the dazzling color of the fall leaves.
[8]
Hamblett almost exclusively used oil paint on canvas.  Carol Crown states that as an artist Hamblett "developed a unique
pointillist
technique that invested her paintings with a distinctive look."
[2]
Personal life and legacy
[
edit
]
Hamblett died 6 March 1977, age 82.
[9]
Hundreds of her drawings and unsold paintings were left to the
University of Mississippi Museum
.
[10]
The largest collection of Theora Hamblett's art is at The University of Mississippi Museum.
[8]
Several of her paintings are also available for display in American embassies.
[11]
Nelson A. Rockefeller
and Sir
Alec Guinness
were other collectors who owned works by Hamblett.
[12]
[13]
Football player
Eli Manning
is also said to own a painting by Theora Hamblett.
[14]
Their charm was recognized as early as 1954, when she sold a painting to a New York gallery owner,
Betty Parsons
.
[15]
She was featured in a 1955 show of new acquisitions at the
Museum of Modern Art
.
[16]
In the 1960s and 1970s, some of her paintings were used for
UNICEF
Christmas cards
and calendars.
[17]
In 1972 she was part of another show at the Museum of Modern Art, this time focusing on
naive art
.
[18]
In 1977, director
William R. Ferris
featured Hamblett in the documentary film "Four Women Artists," produced by the
Center for Southern Folklore
, as one of the four Mississippi
women
in the title, along with writer
Eudora Welty
, quilter
Pecolia Warner
, and embroiderer
Ethel Wright Mohamed
.
[19]
There is a historic marker at the site of Hamblett's house in Oxford.  The house was also depicted in a keepsake ornament produced in 2009 for the University of Mississippi.
[20]
Efforts are currently underway to erect a historical marker near her gravesite in
Paris, Mississippi
.

Monte Carlo biscuits
are an
Australian
sweet
biscuit
that have been manufactured since 1926
(97 years ago)
(

)
by
Arnott's Biscuits Holdings
.
[1]
Each biscuit comprises two biscuit layers sandwiching a creamy filling, while many such biscuits are moulded to a design, both sides of the Monte Carlo biscuit are rough. The biscuit layers have a mild taste of
golden syrup
, honey and coconut, and the cream layer consists of a
vanilla flavoured
cream filling surrounded by a thin toffee-like coating of raspberry jam.
The Monte Carlo biscuit is available in most Australian supermarkets, being typically sold in 250 g (8.8 oz) packages of 12 individual biscuits and as one of the five biscuits in the Arnott's Assorted Creams 500 g (18 oz) variety pack. With an average mass of 20.8 grams (0.73 oz), the Monte Carlo is the heaviest biscuit available in the Assorted Creams pack.
The biscuits were named after the city of
Monte Carlo

Chronology
Previous
Next
1982
1984
The
67th Indianapolis 500
was held at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway
in
Speedway, Indiana
on Sunday, May 29, 1983. After finishing second three times (
1977
,
1978
,
1980
), winning the
pole position
twice (1977-1978), and being the fastest qualifier one additional time (
1981
),
Tom Sneva
finally shook his "
bridesmaid
" status and won his first and only Indianapolis 500. The win also represented the record seventh Indy victory that chief mechanic George Bignotti was involved with.
In the final twenty laps, three-time winner
Al Unser Sr.
was leading
Tom Sneva
. Unser was seeking his record-tying fourth Indy victory. His son, rookie
Al Unser Jr.
was several laps down, but was running right behind his father.
Al Jr.
created a firestorm of controversy when it appeared he was blocking Sneva intentionally to aid his father. After several anxious laps, Sneva finally slipped by both Unsers, pulled away, and claimed his long-awaited first and only Indy victory.
Rookie
Teo Fabi
headlined time trials by winning the
pole position
, and on race day he led the first 23 laps. Fabi's day was short, however, as he dropped out with a bad fuel
gasket
. The effort earned him the
rookie of the year award
. Fabi would go on to win four races during the season and finished second to Al Unser Sr. for the
CART points championship
.
The 1983 Indy 500 ushered in a new era of civility and stability in the sport of
Indy car racing
. After four years of conflict and organizational disputes between
USAC
and
CART
, the two sanctioning bodies came to an amicable truce. The Indianapolis 500 would be sanctioned singly by
USAC
, and officially would be part of the ceremonial
Gold Crown championship
. However, the race was now recognized on the
CART
schedule, and counted towards the
1983 CART PPG Indy Car World Series
points championship. The field for the Indy 500 going forward would consist primarily of CART-based teams, along with numerous one-off ("Indy-only") entries. Despite various squabbles and minor technical differences between the sanctioning bodies, this arrangement would remain in place, with relative harmony, through
1995
.
Background
[
edit
]
The USAC technical committee issued a rule change for 1983, scaling back side skirts and declaring that "all bodywork or aerodynamic devices must be at least one inch above the bottom of the car's tub." During time trials, a total of 15 cars in the qualifying line would fail pre-qualifying technical inspection, raising tempers and drawing the ire of competitors. Some teams charged that USAC was inconsistent in their enforcement and their measuring, since they used a different (and possibly less-accurate) tool than the CART series officials utilized at other races. In addition, some teams claimed the first several cars in line were not scrutinized as heavily as those deeper in line.
The evolving aerodynamic rules coincided with the emergence of the
Robin Herd
-designed
March
chassis becoming the vehicle of choice for the mid-1980s. Coupled with the widely used
Cosworth DFX
engine, the "customer car" era began to dominate the sport of Indy car racing.
Penske
, among other teams, elected to scale back, or even abandon their in-house chassis programs in favor of the English-built March for the next few seasons. The March's aerodynamic advancements, downforce, and affordable cost were among the reasons it emerged as the favorite among the competitors. The "customer car" era also was popular with the smaller-budget teams, as it allowed them access to top equipment, leveling the playing field, and shrinking the differences between haves and the have-nots. The 1983 race would be the first of five consecutive Indy 500 victories for
March Engineering
.

Time trials
[
edit
]
Pole day time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 14. Rain, however, kept cars off the track nearly all day. At 4:15 p.m., the track finally opened for practice, but it was brief and interrupted by several yellow lights. Officials closed the track at 5:49 p.m., without a single car making a qualifying attempt. On Sunday May 15, rain washed out the entire day. It was the first time since 1978 that not a single car qualified on the first weekend. Pole day time trials was moved to the second weekend.
Three-time winner
Johnny Rutherford
was sidelined after two major crashes. On May 8, he crashed in turn one, suffering minor injuries. On May 18, he suffered a more serious crash in turn 3. He broke his left foot and left ankle, and was forced to sit out the 1983 race.
Pole Day - Saturday May 21
[
edit
]
Pole day started with
Mike Mosley
(205.372 mph) taking the top spot early on.
Rick Mears
, a favorite for the pole, had his effort fall short, and he qualified at 204.301 mph.
Tom Sneva
was the next shot at the front row, but his speed of 203.687 mph was only third-fastest at the moment. The next car out was rookie
Teo Fabi
, who had raised eyebrows during the week, posting practice speeds near the top of the speed chart. Fabi set a new one-lap track record of 208.049 mph, and set a four-lap record of 207.395 mph, securing the pole position. Fabi became the first rookie to win the pole since
Walt Faulkner
in
1950
.
A very busy day saw 42 attempts and 33 cars complete qualifying runs. For the first time in modern history, the field was filled to 33 cars in one day.
On a sad note, Tony Foyt Sr., the father of
A. J. Foyt
as well as his former chief mechanic, died after battling lung cancer. After qualifying on Saturday, A. J. Foyt flew to Houston to visit his ailing father. At 8 p.m., Tony Foyt Sr. lapsed into a coma, and died at 10 p.m.
[3]
Bump Day - Sunday May 22
[
edit
]
The day opened with
John Mahler
(180.022 mph) on the bubble. Rain again hampered time trials, and the track did not open until nearly 2 p.m.
Phil Krueger
wrecked during a practice run, and
Gary Bettenhausen
waved off a run after one lap over 193 mph.
At 4:14 p.m.,
Dennis Firestone
completed a run of 190.888 mph, bumping
Mahler
. Moments later, rain began to fall, and the track was closed for the day. The 6 o'clock gun fired with several drivers, including
Bettenhausen
,
Bill Alsup
,
Dick Ferguson
all left sitting in line.

Race summary
[
edit
]
First half
[
edit
]
Rookie
Teo Fabi
took the lead from the pole position and led the first 23 laps.
A. J. Foyt
, who earlier in the week had attended his father's funeral, dropped out early with a broken transmission u-joint linkage. At almost the same time,
George Snider
, Foyt's other team car, dropped out with ignition failure. Both Foyt cars were out just beyond the 50-mile mark. After showing speed early, Fabi dropped out with a bad fuel gasket. During an early pit stop, the refueling mechanism failed, and fuel spilled around the car, but it did not ignite.
On lap 81,
Johnny Parsons
spun in front of
Mario Andretti
in turn one. Both cars crashed hard into the outside wall. It was Andretti's first ride at Indy with
Newman/Haas Racing
, and yet another
misfortune
for him at the 500.
Second half
[
edit
]
First half contender
Bobby Rahal
dropped out with a punctured radiator. The lead in the second half was maintained by
Tom Sneva
and
Al Unser Sr.
Sneva's teammate
Kevin Cogan
, as well as
Geoff Brabham
were also running near the top five.
On lap 172,
Tom Sneva
led with
Al Unser Sr.
second. Sneva was right behind the lapped car of
Mike Mosley
when his pit crew put out the sign board for him to make his final pit stop. Seconds later, Mosley spun right in front of Sneva coming out of turn one and crashed into the outside wall. Mosely suffered a bruised foot in the wreck.
[5]
Sneva veered to the inside and narrowly avoided the incident. Mosley's notable "Indy jinx" continued, and it would be his final lap at the Speedway - he was killed in a traffic accident less than a year later.
With the yellow out, Sneva pitted the next time around, his final scheduled pit stop of the day.
Al Unser Sr.
was also in the pits. Unser had a much faster pit stop, electing not to change tires, and came out in the lead. Sneva was now second.
Finish
[
edit
]
The green flag came back out on lap 176 with
Al Unser Sr.
leading and
Tom Sneva
in second. As the cars were going through turn four, the 10th place car of rookie
Al Unser Jr.
(five laps down at the time) jumped the restart. He passed both Sneva and his father Al Sr. One lap later, Al Jr. allowed his father by, and settled in between his father and second place Tom Sneva. Over the next several laps, it became clear that Al Jr. was attempting to run interference for his father. Al Jr. was known to openly root for his father, and incidentally it was Al Sr.'s 44th birthday. As the race hit lap 180, officials started displaying Al Unser Jr. the
blue flag
.
The blue "move over"
courtesy flag.
While many feel Al Jr. did not actually make many onerous and intentional "blocking" moves, he did create a significant amount of
"dirty air"
for Sneva, and did not yield the preferred racing line. Despite the impedance, Al Sr. was not pulling away nor seemed able to extend his lead. The three cars continued to run very close together. As the laps dwindled, the controversy began to grow.
With 13 laps to go, Sneva pulled alongside Al Unser Jr. on the frontstretch. The two cars went side-by-side into turn one, but Al Jr. refused to give up the ground.
With ten laps to go, the three cars caught up to lapped traffic. Al Jr. got stuck behind the car of
Dick Simon
, and Sneva immediately pounced on the moment. Sneva veered down low, passed Al Jr. and Simon in consecutive corners, and set his sights on the leader. Down the backstretch, Sneva set up his pass and easily got by Al Unser Sr. going into turn three. He passed two more cars before the end of the lap and immediately began building a lead.
With an open track ahead of him now, Tom Sneva picked up the pace and put considerable distance between himself and Unser. Sneva cruised to victory, by a margin of 11.174 seconds. It was Sneva's first Indy 500 victory (after three previous runner-up finishes) and chief mechanic George Bignotti's record seventh Indy 500 victory.
After stirring up controversy, Al Unser Jr. ran out of fuel on the final lap. He stalled on the course before reaching the finish line, and was scored six laps down at the finish.
Post race
[
edit
]
In post-race interviews,
Al Unser Jr.
admitted to running interference for his father, claiming he was trying to create "dirty air" and
turbulence
for Sneva. He stopped short, however, of calling it "blocking."
[6]
Al Jr. was highly criticized for the actions, by both competitors and media. However, after the race
USAC
examined the incident, and issued no penalties for blocking,
[6]
citing the fact that he did not actually break any written rules.
Al Unser Sr.
claimed he did not know what was going on behind him, because he lost one of his rear-view mirrors, and the other one was broken.
[6]
Furthermore, Al Sr. noted that he made a miscalculation on his final pit stop, ordering his crew to not change tires. As a result, his handling went away in the closing laps. While Al Jr. and Sneva were sparring, Al Sr. was instead preoccupied with nursing his loose, ill-handling machine.
Sneva charged Al Jr. with jumping the restart and illegally passing the two leaders before the green came out.
[7]
After the race Al Jr. was issued a two-lap penalty for passing two cars before the green light, but the penalty did not cost him any positions. Unser still finished in the top ten as the highest finishing rookie. However, he lost out on the
rookie of the year award
, which went to polesitter

Paul Page
served as anchor for the seventh year.
Lou Palmer
reported from victory lane. The crew saw little change from 1982, but some of the assignments were shifted. Longtime radio veteran Luke Walton assumed his customary duty during the pre-race ceremonies of introducing the starting command.
[10]
However, he did not serve as a pit reporter during the race itself. Walton would continue on the broadcast, but only in a limited role, through 1988.
Bob Forbes rode in one of the pace cars during the parade lap.
Lou Palmer maintained his traditional location at the far south end of the pits. However, the other pit reporters appeared to have lesser-defined zones for 1983. During the first half of the race, all pit reporters congregated around the leaders' pits, including roving reporter Bob Forbes. During the second half of the race, Jerry Baker moved up to the north pits and Chuck Marlowe covered the center pits. Forbes then moved to the garage area and track hospital, while Palmer stayed in the south end. Sally Larvick returned for her second race, conducting interviews throughout the broadcast.
For 1983, after a brief one-year change, the famous commercial out-cue was restored back to
"Now stay tuned for the Greatest Spectacle in Racing."
For the first time, the broadcast signed on at 10:00 a.m. local time, providing one-hour of pre-race coverage.

The first evidence of human presence in
Ireland
dates to around 33,000 years ago, with further findings dating the presence of
homo sapiens
to around 10,500 to 7,000 BC.
[1]
The receding of the ice after the
Younger Dryas
cold phase of the
Quaternary
around 9700 BC, heralds the beginning of
Prehistoric Ireland
, which includes the archaeological periods known as the
Mesolithic
, the
Neolithic
from about 4000 BC and the
Copper Age
beginning around 2500 BC with the arrival of the
Beaker Culture
. The Irish
Bronze Age
proper begins around 2000 BC and ends with the arrival of the
Iron Age
of the
Celtic
Hallstatt culture
, beginning about 600 BC. The subsequent
La Tène culture
brought new styles and practices by 300 BC.
Greek and Roman 
writers give some information about Ireland during the Classical period (see "
protohistoric
" period), by which time the island may be termed "
Gaelic Ireland
". By the late 4th century AD Christianity had begun to gradually subsume or replace the earlier
Celtic polytheism
. By the end of the 6th century it had introduced writing along with a predominantly monastic
Celtic Christian
church, profoundly altering Irish society.
Viking
raids and settlement from the late 8th century AD resulted in extensive cultural interchange, as well as innovation in military and transport technology. Many of Ireland's towns were founded at this time as Viking trading posts and coinage made its first appearance.
[2]
Viking penetration was limited and concentrated along coasts and rivers, and ceased to be a major threat to Gaelic culture after the
Battle of Clontarf
in 1014. The
Norman invasion
in 1169 resulted again in a partial conquest of the island and marked the beginning of more than 800 years of English political and military involvement in Ireland. Initially successful, Norman gains were rolled back over succeeding centuries as a Gaelic resurgence
[3]
reestablished Gaelic cultural preeminence over most of the country, apart from the walled towns and the area around
Dublin
known as
The Pale
.
Reduced to the control of small pockets, the
English Crown
did not make another attempt to conquer the island until after the end of the
Wars of the Roses
(1488). This released resources and manpower for overseas expansion, beginning in the early 16th century. However, the nature of Ireland's decentralised political organisation into small territories (known as
túatha
), martial traditions, difficult terrain and climate and lack of urban infrastructure, meant that attempts to assert Crown authority were slow and expensive. Attempts to impose the new Protestant faith were also successfully resisted by both the Gaelic and Norman-Irish. The new policy fomented the rebellion of the
Hiberno-Norman
Earl of Kildare
Silken Thomas
in 1534, keen to defend his traditional autonomy and Catholicism, and marked the beginning of the prolonged
Tudor
conquest of Ireland lasting from 1534 to 1603.
Henry VIII
proclaimed himself
King of Ireland
in 1541 to facilitate the project. Ireland became a potential battleground in the
wars
between Catholic
Counter-Reformation
and
Protestant Reformation
Europe.
England's attempts either to conquer or to assimilate both the Hiberno-Norman lordships and the Gaelic territories into the
Kingdom of Ireland
provided the impetus for ongoing warfare, notable examples being the
1st Desmond Rebellion
, the
2nd Desmond Rebellion
and the
Nine Years War
. This period was marked by the Crown policies of, at first,
surrender and regrant
, and later,
plantation
, involving the arrival of thousands of English and
Scottish
Protestant
settlers, and the displacement of both the Hiberno-Normans (or Old English as they were known by then) and the native
Catholic
landholders. With English colonies going back to the 1550s, Ireland was arguably the first English and then British territory colonised by a group known as the
West Country Men
.
Gaelic Ireland
was finally defeated at the
battle of Kinsale
in 1601 which marked the collapse of the Gaelic system and the beginning of Ireland's history as fully part of the English and later
British Empire
.
During the 17th century, this division between a Protestant landholding minority and a dispossessed Catholic majority was intensified and conflict between them was to become a recurrent theme in Irish history. Domination of Ireland by the
Protestant Ascendancy
was reinforced after two periods of religious war, the
Irish Confederate Wars
in 1641-52 and the
Williamite war
in 1689-91. Political power thereafter rested almost exclusively in the hands of a minority Protestant Ascendancy, while Catholics and members of
dissenting
Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations under the
Penal Laws
.
On 1 January 1801, in the wake of the republican
United Irishmen Rebellion
, the
Irish Parliament
was abolished and Ireland became part of a new
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
formed by the
Acts of Union 1800
. Catholics were not granted full rights until
Catholic Emancipation
in 1829, achieved by
Daniel O’Connell
. The
Great Famine
struck Ireland in 1845 resulting in over a million deaths from starvation and disease and a million refugees fleeing the country, mainly to America. Irish attempts to break away continued with
Parnell's
Irish Parliamentary Party
which strove from the 1880s to attain
Home Rule
through the parliamentary constitutional movement, eventually winning the
Home Rule Act 1914
, although this Act was suspended at the outbreak of
World War I
. In 1916, the
Easter Rising
succeeded in turning public opinion against the British establishment after the execution of the leaders by British authorities. It also eclipsed the home rule movement. In 1922, after the
Irish War of Independence
most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to become the independent
Irish Free State
but under the
Anglo-Irish Treaty
the six northeastern counties, known as
Northern Ireland
, remained within the United Kingdom, creating the partition of Ireland. The treaty was opposed by many; their opposition led to the outbreak of the
Irish Civil War
, in which
Irish Free State
, or "pro-treaty", forces proved victorious.
The
history of Northern Ireland
has since been dominated by the division of society along sectarian faultlines and conflict between (mainly Catholic)
Irish nationalists
and (mainly Protestant)
British unionists
. These divisions erupted into
the Troubles
in the late 1960s, after civil rights marches were met with opposition by authorities. The violence escalated after the deployment of the British Army to maintain authority led to clashes with nationalist communities. The violence continued for twenty-eight years until an uneasy, but largely successful peace was finally achieved with the
Good Friday Agreement
in 1998.

Ireland during the
Ice Age
What is known of pre-Christian Ireland comes from references in
Roman
writings,
Irish poetry
, myth, and archaeology. While some possible
Paleolithic
tools have been found, none of the finds is convincing of Paleolithic settlement in Ireland.
[4]
However a bear bone found in
Alice and Gwendoline Cave
, County Clare, in 1903 may push back dates for the earliest human settlement of Ireland to 10,500 BC. The bone shows clear signs of cut marks with stone tools and has been radiocarbon dated to 12,500 years ago.
[5]
It is possible that humans crossed a land bridge during the warm period, referred to as the
Bølling-Allerød warming
, that lasted between 14,700 and 12,700 years ago towards the end of the last ice age, and allowed the reinhabitation of northern Europe. A sudden return to freezing conditions known as the
Younger Dryas
cold phase, which lasted from 10,900 BC to 9700 BC, may have depopulated Ireland. During the Younger Dryas, sea levels continued to rise and no ice-free land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland ever returned.
[6]
The earliest confirmed inhabitants of Ireland were
Mesolithic
hunter-gatherers
, who arrived sometime around 7900 BC.
[7]
While some authors take the view that a
land bridge
connecting Ireland to
Great Britain
still existed at that time,
[8]
more recent studies indicate that Ireland was separated from Britain by c. 14,000 BC when the climate was still cold and local ice caps persisted in parts of the country.
[9]
The people remained hunter-gatherers until about 4000 BC. It is argued this is when the first signs of agriculture started to show, leading to the establishment of a
Neolithic
culture, characterised by the appearance of pottery, polished stone tools, rectangular wooden houses, megalithic tombs, and domesticated sheep and cattle.
[10]
Some of these tombs, as at
Knowth
and
Dowth
, are huge stone monuments and many of them, such as the
Passage Tombs
of
Newgrange
, are astronomically aligned. Four main types of
Irish Megalithic Tombs
have been identified:
dolmens
,
court cairns
,
passage tombs
and
wedge-shaped gallery graves
.
[10]
In
Leinster
and Munster, individual adult males were buried in small stone structures, called
cists
, under earthen mounds and were accompanied by distinctive decorated pottery. This culture apparently prospered, and the island became more densely populated. Near the end of the Neolithic new types of monuments developed, such as circular embanked enclosures and timber, stone and post and pit circles.
The
Céide Fields
[11]
[12]
[13]
is an archaeological site on the north
County Mayo
coast in the west of
Ireland
, about
7 kilometres northwest of
Ballycastle
, and the site is the most extensive
Neolithic
site in Ireland and contains the oldest known
field systems
in the world.
[14]
[15]
Using various dating methods, it was discovered that the creation and development of the Céide Fields goes back some five and a half thousand years (~3500 BC).
[16]
Newgrange
, built c. 3200 BC, is an Irish
passage tomb
located at
Brú na Bóinne
.
The short-lived Irish
Copper Age
and subsequent
Bronze Age
, which came to Ireland around 2000 BC, saw the production of elaborate
gold
and
bronze
ornaments, weapons and tools. There was a movement away from the construction of communal megalithic tombs to the burial of the dead in small stone cists or simple pits, which could be situated in cemeteries or in circular earth or stone-built burial mounds known respectively as
barrows
and
cairns
. As the period progressed, inhumation burial gave way to cremation and by the Middle Bronze Age, remains were often placed beneath large burial urns. During the late Bronze Age, there was an increase in stored weapons, which has been taken as evidence for greater warfare. Fleshed
bog bodies
also appear at this time, continuing into the Iron Age.
[17]
Iron Age (600 BC-400 AD)
[
edit
]
The Iron Age in Ireland began about 600 BC. The period between the start of the Iron Age and the historic period (AD 431) saw the gradual infiltration of small groups of Celtic-speaking people into Ireland,
[18]
[19]
with items of the continental Celtic
La Tene style
being found in at least the northern part of the island by about 300 BC.
[20]
[21]
The result of a gradual blending of Celtic and indigenous cultures would result in the emergence of Gaelic culture by the fifth century.
[18]
[22]
It is also during the fifth century that the main over-kingdoms of In Tuisceart, Airgialla, Ulaid, Mide, Laigin, Mumhain, Cóiced Ol nEchmacht began to emerge (see
Kingdoms of ancient Ireland
). Within these kingdoms, a rich culture flourished. The society of these kingdoms was dominated by an upper class consisting of aristocratic warriors and learned people, which possibly included
Druids
.
Linguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the
Goidelic languages
, was a branch of the
Celtic languages
. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by
Celts
from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.
[23]
[24]
The hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.
[25]
In 60 AD, it is said that the Romans invaded
Anglesey
in Wales causing concerns across the Irish Sea, but there is a small controversy
[26]
on if they even set foot into Ireland. The closest Rome got to conquering Ireland was in 80 AD, when, according to Turtle Bunbury from the
Irish Times
,
[27]
“Túathal Techtmar, the son of a deposed high king, who is said to have invaded Ireland from afar in order to regain his kingdom at about this time”.
The Romans referred to Ireland as
Hibernia
around AD 100.
Ptolemy
, in AD 100, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the
Roman Empire
, but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders.
Tacitus
writes that an exiled Irish prince was with
Agricola
in
Roman Britain
and would return to seize power in Ireland.
Juvenal
tells us that Roman "arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around AD 100,
[28]
but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear.
Irish confederations (the
Scoti
) attacked and some settled in
Britain
during the
Great Conspiracy
of 367. In particular, the
Dál Riata
settled in western Scotland and the
Western Isles
.
Early Christian Ireland (400-800)
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of Ireland (400-800)
Kevin's
monastery at
Glendalough
,
County Wicklow
The middle centuries of the first millennium AD marked great changes in Ireland. Politically, what appears to have been a prehistoric emphasis on tribal affiliation had been replaced by the 8th century by patrilineal dynasties ruling the island's kingdoms. Many formerly powerful kingdoms and peoples disappeared. Irish pirates struck all over the coast of western Britain in the same way that the Vikings would later attack Ireland. Some of these founded entirely new kingdoms in
Pictland
and, to a lesser degree, in parts of
Cornwall
,
Wales
, and
Cumbria
. The
Attacotti
of south
Leinster
may even have served in the Roman military in the mid-to-late 300s.
[29]
Perhaps it was some of the latter returning home as rich mercenaries, merchants, or slaves stolen from Britain or Gaul, that first brought the Christian faith to Ireland. Some early sources claim that there were missionaries active in southern Ireland long before
St. Patrick
. Whatever the route, and there were probably many, this new faith was to have the most profound effect on the Irish.
Tradition maintains that in A.D. 432,
St. Patrick
arrived on the island and, in the years that followed, worked to convert the Irish to Christianity. St Patrick's
Confession
, in Latin, written by him is the earliest Irish historical document. It gives some information about the Saint.
[30]
On the other hand, according to
Prosper of Aquitaine
, a contemporary chronicler,
Palladius
was sent to Ireland by the Pope in 431 as
"first Bishop to the Irish believing in Christ"
, which demonstrates that there were already Christians living in Ireland. Palladius seems to have worked purely as Bishop to Irish Christians in the Leinster and Meath kingdoms, while Patrick - who may have arrived as late as 461 - worked first and foremost as a missionary to the pagan Irish, in the more remote kingdoms in Ulster and Connacht.
A page from the
Book of Kells
that opens the
Gospel of John
Patrick is traditionally credited with preserving and codifying Irish laws and changing only those that conflicted with Christian practices. He is credited with introducing the
Roman alphabet
, which enabled Irish monks to preserve parts of the extensive oral literature. The historicity of these claims remains the subject of debate and there is no direct evidence linking Patrick with any of these accomplishments. The myth of Patrick, as scholars refer to it, was developed in the centuries after his death.
[31]
Irish scholars excelled in the study of
Latin
learning and Christian theology in the monasteries that flourished shortly thereafter.
Missionaries from Ireland
to England and
Continental Europe
spread the news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the
Early Middle Ages
. The period of
Insular art
, mainly in the fields of
illuminated manuscripts
, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the
Book of Kells
, the
Ardagh Chalice
, and the many carved
stone crosses
that dot the island. Insular style was to be a crucial ingredient in the formation of the
Romanesque
and
Gothic
styles throughout Western Europe. Sites dating to this period include
clochans
,
ringforts
and
promontory forts
.
Francis John Byrne
describes the effect of the epidemics which occurred during this era:
The plagues of the 660s and the 680s had a traumatic effect on Irish society. The golden age of the saints was over, together with the generation of kings who could fire a
saga

History of Ireland (800-1169)
Map showing the
Viking settlements
in Ireland
The first recorded
Viking
raid in Irish history occurred in 795 AD when Vikings from
Norway
looted the island. Early Viking raids were generally fast-paced and small in scale. These early raids interrupted the golden age of Christian Irish culture and marked the beginning of two centuries of intermittent warfare, with waves of Viking raiders plundering monasteries and towns throughout Ireland. Most of those early raiders came from western Norway.
The Vikings were expert sailors, who travelled in
longships
, and by the early 840s, had begun to establish settlements along the Irish coasts and to spend the winter months there. The longships were technologically advanced, allowing them to travel faster through the narrow rivers. Vikings founded settlements in several places; most famously in
Dublin
. Most of the settlements were near the water, allowing the Vikings to trade using their longships. Written accounts from this time (early to mid 840s) show that the Vikings were moving further inland to attack (often using rivers) and then retreating to their coastal headquarters.
In 852, the Vikings landed in
Dublin Bay
and established a fortress. Dublin became the centre for the trade of many goods, especially slaves. Bringing back new ideas and motivations, they began settling more permanently. In the tenth century, an earthen bank was constructed around the city with a second larger bank built outside that in the eleventh century. On the interior of the town, an extensive series of defences have been excavated at Fishamble Street, Dublin. The site featured nine waterfronts, including two possible flood banks and two positive defensive embankments during the Viking Age. The early embankments were non-defensive, being only one metre high, and it is uncertain how much of the site they encircled. After several generations a group of mixed Irish and Norse ethnic background arose, the
Gall-Gaels
, '(
Gall
being the Old Irish word for foreign).
The second wave of Vikings made stations at winter bases called
longphorts
to serve as control centres to exert a more localized force on the island through raiding. The third wave in 917 established towns as not only control centres, but also as centres of trade to enter into Irish economy and greater Western Europe. Returning to Dublin, they set up a market town. Over the next century, a great period of economic growth would spread across the pastoral country. The Vikings brought Ireland into their wide-ranging system of international trade, as well as popularizing a silver-based economy with local trade and the first minting of coins in 997.
In 902
Máel Finnia mac Flannacain
of Brega and
Cerball mac Muirecáin
of Leinster joined forces against Dublin, and "The heathens were driven from Ireland, i.e. from the fortress of Áth Cliath [Dublin]".
[note 1]
They were allowed by the Saxons to settle in
Wirral
, England, but would however later return to retake Dublin.
[34]
The Vikings never achieved total domination of Ireland, often fighting for and against various Irish kings. The great
High King of Ireland
,
Brian Boru
, defeated the Vikings at the
Battle of Clontarf
in 1014 which began the decline of Viking power in Ireland but the towns which Vikings had founded continued to flourish, and trade became an important part of the Irish economy.
Brian Boru
, by more or less unifying Ireland, changed the
High Kingship
in the way that the High King would now have more power and control over the country and could manage the country's affairs.
[35]
This led to prosperity for Ireland over the next few years. The Irish economy grew as international trade became more common. The towns founded by the Vikings continued to grow and thrive as centres of Irish trade and finance. They remain so to this day.
Despite the breaking of Norse power in Ireland, the Norse still maintained control of the
Kingdom of Dublin
. Although the
King of Leinster
levied tribute from the Norse, they rarely directly intervened in the affairs of the city-state, as it brought trade to the area. This changed, however, when
Diarmuit mac Maél na mBó
, King of Leinster, captured Dublin in 1052. This gave the Irish greater access to the
Kingdom of the Isles
. Diarmuit was able to become
High King of Ireland
, and after his death, the
O'Brien dynasty
, who ruled Ireland since the days of Brian Boru, reclaimed the High Kingship and Irish influence in the
Irish Sea
area would increase dramatically over the next few decades, notably under High King
Muircherteach Ua Briain
, who was noted for his interest in foreign affairs.
[36]
Perhaps it was Muircherteach's increasing power in the
Isles
that led
Magnus Barefoot
,
King of Norway
, to lead campaigns against the Irish in 1098 and again in 1102 to bring Norse areas back under Norwegian control, while also raiding the various British kingdoms. Although direct conflict with the
Kingdom of Norway
seemed imminent, the two Kings formed an alliance by the marriage of Muircherteach's daughter to Magnus' son. The two would campaign together in
Ulster
, until Magnus was killed in an ambush by the
Ulaid
in August 1103, under mysterious circumstances (it is possible Muircherteach ordered his killing). Muircherteach was also politically involved in the Kingdoms of
Scotland
and
England
, as well as
Wales
.
[36]
One of the most prosperous reigns of any High King was the reign of
Toirdelbach Ua Conchobhair
, who had overthrown Muircherteach and partitioned
Munster
in 1118. As
King of Connacht
and then
King of Ireland
, Ireland underwent a period of modernization and elevation on the European stage.
[37]
Under his rule, the first
castles
in Ireland were built bringing improved defence and brought a new aspect to Irish warfare. He also built a naval base and castle at
Dún Gaillimhe
. A settlement grew around this castle which would grow to be the
city of Galway
today.
[38]
He was a superb
military commander
and this allowed him to keep control of Ireland, with the help of the castles he built and his
fleet
based at
Dún Gaillimhe
.
[38]
He also had commercial and political links with the rulers of
France
,
Spain
and
England
, increasing Ireland's international presence which brought more trade to the island. His reign lasted more than 50 years.
[38]
One of Tairrdelbach's sons,
Ruadhrí
, would later go on to be
High King
himself. He was arguably the first High King without opposition, however, he would later
abdicate
following the
Norman invasion of Ireland
.

Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland
A tower house near
Quin, County Clare
. The Normans consolidated their presence in Ireland by building hundreds of castles and towers such as this.
By the 12th century, Ireland was divided politically into shifting
petty kingdoms
and over-kingdoms. Power was exercised by the heads of a few regional dynasties vying against each other for supremacy over the whole island. One of these men, King
Diarmait Mac Murchada
of
Leinster
was forcibly exiled by the new High King,
Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair
of the Western kingdom of Connacht. Fleeing to
Aquitaine
, Diarmait obtained permission from
Henry II
to recruit
Norman
knights to regain his kingdom. The first Norman knights landed in Ireland in 1167, followed by the main forces of Normans, Welsh and
Flemings
. Several counties were restored to the control of Diarmait, who named his son-in-law, the Norman
Richard de Clare
, known as Strongbow, heir to his kingdom. This troubled King Henry, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to establish his authority. In 1177, Prince
John Lackland
was made
Lord of Ireland
by his father
Henry II of England
at the
Council of Oxford
.
[40]
With the authority of the papal bull
Laudabiliter
from
Adrian IV
, Henry landed with a large fleet at
Waterford
in 1171, becoming the first
King of England
to set foot on Irish soil. Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son John with the title
Dominus Hiberniae
("Lord of Ireland"). When John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as
King John of England
, the "
Lordship of Ireland
" fell directly under the English Crown.

[

Main article:
Lordship of Ireland
The Normans initially controlled the entire east coast, from
Waterford
to eastern
Ulster
, and penetrated a considerable distance inland as well. The counties were ruled by many smaller kings. The first Lord of Ireland was King John, who visited Ireland in 1185 and 1210 and helped consolidate the Norman-controlled areas while ensuring that the many Irish kings swore fealty to him.
Throughout the thirteenth century, the policy of the English Kings was to weaken the power of the Norman Lords in Ireland. For example, King John encouraged
Hugh de Lacy
to destabilise and then overthrow the Lord of Ulster, before naming him as the first Earl of Ulster. The
Hiberno-Norman
community suffered from a series of invasions that ceased the spread of their settlement and power. Politics and events in Gaelic Ireland served to draw the settlers deeper into the orbit of the Irish.
Furthermore, unlike the Anglo-Normans, the Gaelic kings did not keep detailed estate inventories and accounts. Coupled with the absence of archaeological evidence to the contrary, this has tempted many scholars of medieval western Ireland to agree with the twelfth-century historian
Giraldus Cambrensis
who argued that the Gaelic kings did not build castles.

.
By 1261 the weakening of the
Normans
had become manifest when
Fineen MacCarthy
defeated a Norman army at the
Battle of Callann
. The war continued between the different lords and earls for about 100 years, causing much destruction, especially around Dublin. In this chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land that their families had lost since the conquest and held them after the war was over.
The
Black Death
arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled territory shrank to a fortified area around Dublin (
the Pale
), whose rulers had little real authority outside (beyond the Pale).
By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the
Wars of the Roses
. The
Lordship of Ireland
lay in the hands of the powerful Fitzgerald
Earl of Kildare
, who dominated the country by means of military force and alliances with Irish lords and clans. Around the country, local Gaelic and
Gaelicised
lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin but the power of the Dublin government was seriously curtailed by the introduction of
Poynings' Law
in 1494. According to this act, the Irish Parliament was essentially put under the control of the
Westminster Parliament
.

Conquest and rebellion
[

Main articles:
Tudor conquest of Ireland
and
Kingdom of Ireland
From 1536, Henry VIII of England decided to reconquer Ireland and bring it under crown control. The Fitzgerald dynasty of
Kildare
, who had become the effective rulers of Ireland in the 15th century, had become unreliable allies of the Tudor monarchs. They had invited
Burgundian
troops into Dublin to crown the
Yorkist
pretender,
Lambert Simnel
as
King of England
in 1487. Again in 1536,
Silken Thomas
, Fitzgerald went into open rebellion against the crown. Having put down this rebellion, Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. In 1542, he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full kingdom. Henry was proclaimed King of Ireland at a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year. This was the first meeting of the Irish Parliament to be attended by the
Gaelic Irish
chieftains as well as the
Hiberno-Norman
aristocracy. With the institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The
Spanish Armada in Ireland
suffered heavy losses during an extraordinary season of storms in the autumn of 1588. Among the survivors was Captain
Francisco de Cuellar
, who gave a remarkable account of his experiences on the run in Ireland.
[43]
The re-conquest was completed during the reigns of
Elizabeth
and
James I
, after several brutal conflicts. (See the
Desmond Rebellions
, 1569-73 and 1579-83, and the
Nine Years War
, 1594-1603, for details.) After this point, the English authorities in Dublin established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. In 1614 the Catholic majority in the Irish Parliament was overthrown through the creation of numerous new boroughs which were dominated by the new settlers. However, the English were not successful in converting the Catholic Irish to the Protestant religion and the brutal methods used by crown authority (including resorting to
martial law
) to bring the country under English control, heightened resentment of English rule.
From the mid-16th to the early 17th century, crown governments had carried out a policy of land confiscation and
colonisation
known as
Plantations
. Scottish and English Protestant colonists were sent to the provinces of
Munster
,
Ulster
and the counties of
Laois
and
Offaly
. These Protestant settlers replaced the Irish Catholic landowners who were removed from their lands. These settlers formed the ruling class of future British appointed administrations in Ireland. Several
Penal Laws
, aimed at Catholics, Baptists and Presbyterians, were introduced to encourage conversion to the established (
Anglican
)
Church of Ireland
.
Wars and penal laws
[
edit
]
After an unusually bitter Irish Catholic rebellion and civil war,
Oliver Cromwell
, on behalf of the English Commonwealth, re-conquered Ireland by invasion which lasted from 1649 to 1651. Under Cromwell's government, landownership in Ireland was transferred overwhelmingly to
Puritan
soldiery and commercial undertakers to pay for the war.
The 17th century was perhaps the bloodiest in Ireland's history. Two periods of war (1641-53 and 1689-91) caused a huge loss of life. The ultimate dispossession of most of the Irish Catholic landowning class was engineered, and recusants were subordinated under the
Penal Laws
.
During the 17th century, Ireland was convulsed by
eleven years of warfare
, beginning with the
Rebellion of 1641
, when Irish Catholics rebelled against the domination of English and Protestant settlers. The Catholic gentry briefly ruled the country as
Confederate Ireland
(1642-1649) against the background of the
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
until
Oliver Cromwell
reconquered
Ireland in 1649-1653 on behalf of the
English Commonwealth
. Cromwell's conquest was the most brutal phase of the war. By its close, around half of Ireland's pre-war population was killed or exiled as slaves, where many died due to harsh conditions. As retribution for the rebellion of 1641, the better-quality remaining lands owned by Irish Catholics were confiscated and
given to British settlers
. Several hundred remaining native landowners were transplanted to
Connacht
.

James II of England

Forty years later, Irish Catholics, known as "Jacobites", fought for James from 1688 to 1691, but failed to restore James to the throne of Ireland, England and Scotland.
Ireland became the main battleground after the
Glorious Revolution
of 1688, when the Catholic
James II
left London and the
English Parliament
replaced him with
William of Orange
. The wealthier Irish Catholics backed James to try to reverse the
Penal Laws
and land confiscations, whereas Protestants supported William and Mary in this "Glorious Revolution" to preserve their property in the country. James and William fought for the
Kingdom of Ireland
in the
Williamite War
, most famously at the
Battle of the Boyne
in 1690, where James's outnumbered forces were defeated.
Indentured Labour
[
edit
]
From the 15th to the 18th century, Irish, English, Scots and Welsh prisoners were transported for forced labour in the Caribbean to work off their term of punishment. Even larger numbers came voluntarily as indentured servants. In the 18th century they were sent to the American colonies, and in the early 19th century to Australia.
[44]
[45]
The Irish were dehumanised by the English, described as "savages," so making their displacement appear all the more justified. In 1654 the British parliament gave
Oliver Cromwell
a free hand to banish Irish "undesirables". Cromwell rounded up Catholics throughout the Irish countryside and placed them on ships bound for the
Caribbean
, mainly the island of
Barbados
. By 1655, 12,000 political prisoners had been forcibly shipped to Barbados and into indentured servitude.

Protestant ascendancy (1691-1800)
[

Main article:
History of Ireland (1691-1800)
See also:
Protestant Ascendancy
The majority of the people of Ireland were Catholic peasants; they were very poor and largely inert politically during the eighteenth century, as many of their leaders converted to Protestantism to avoid severe economic and political penalties. Nevertheless, there was a growing Catholic cultural awakening underway.
[47]
There were two Protestant groups. The Presbyterians in Ulster in the North lived in much better economic conditions but had virtually no political power. Power was held by a small group of
Anglo-Irish
families, who were loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland. They owned the great bulk of the farmland, where the work was done by the Catholic peasants. Many of these families lived in England and were absentee landlords, whose loyalty was basically to England. The Anglo-Irish who lived in Ireland became increasingly identified as Irish nationalists, and were resentful of the English control of their island. Their spokesmen, such as
Jonathan Swift
and
Edmund Burke
, sought more local control.
[48]
Jacobite
resistance in Ireland was finally ended after the
Battle of Aughrim
in July 1691. The
Penal Laws
that had been relaxed somewhat after the
Restoration
were reinforced more thoroughly after this war, as the infant Anglo-Irish Ascendancy wanted to ensure that the Irish Roman Catholics would not be in a position to repeat their rebellions. Power was held by the 5% who were Protestants belonging to the Church of Ireland. They controlled all major sectors of the Irish economy, the bulk of the farmland, the legal system, local government and held strong majorities in both houses of the Irish Parliament. They strongly distrusted the Presbyterians in Ulster and were convinced that the Catholics should have minimal rights. They did not have full political control because the government in London had superior authority and treated Ireland as a backward colony. When the American colonies revolted in the 1770s, the Ascendency wrested multiple concessions to strengthen its power. They did not seek independence because they knew they were heavily outnumbered and ultimately depended upon the British Army to guarantee their security.
[49]
Subsequent Irish antagonism toward England was aggravated by the economic situation of Ireland in the 18th century. Some
absentee landlords
managed their estates inefficiently, and food tended to be produced for export rather than for domestic consumption. Two very cold winters near the end of the
Little Ice Age
led directly to a
famine between 1740 and 1741
, which killed about 400,000 people and caused over 150,000 Irish to leave the island. In addition, Irish exports were reduced by the
Navigation Acts
from the 1660s, which placed tariffs on Irish products entering England, but exempted English goods from tariffs on entering Ireland. Despite this, most of the 18th century was relatively peaceful in comparison with the preceding two centuries, and the population doubled to over four million.
By the 18th century, the Anglo-Irish ruling class had come to see Ireland, not England, as their native country.
[50]
A Parliamentary faction led by
Henry Grattan
agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with Great Britain and for greater legislative independence for the
Irish Parliament
. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals toward
enfranchising Irish Catholics
. This was partially enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet become members of the Irish Parliament, or become government officials. Some were attracted to the more militant example of the
French Revolution
of 1789.
Presbyterians and Dissenters too faced persecution on a lesser scale, and in 1791 a group of dissident Protestant individuals, all of whom but two were Presbyterians, held the first meeting of what would become the
Society of the United Irishmen
. Originally they sought to reform the Irish Parliament which was controlled by those belonging to the state church; seek Catholic Emancipation; and help remove religion from politics. When their ideals seemed unattainable they became more determined to use force to overthrow British rule and found a non-sectarian republic. Their activity culminated in the
Irish Rebellion of 1798
, which was bloodily suppressed.
Ireland was a separate kingdom ruled by King George III of Britain; he set policy for Ireland through his appointment of the
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
or viceroy. In practice, the viceroys lived in England and the affairs in the island were largely controlled by an elite group of Irish Protestants known as "undertakers." The system changed in 1767, with the appointment of an English politician who became a very strong Viceroy.
George Townshend
served 1767-72 and was in residence in The Castle in Dublin. Townsend had the strong support of both the King and the British cabinet in London, and all major decisions were basically made in London. The Ascendancy complained, and obtained a series of new laws in the 1780s that made the Irish Parliament effective and independent of the British Parliament, although still under the supervision of the king and his Privy Council.
[51]
Largely in response to the 1798 rebellion, Irish self-government was ended altogether by the provisions of the
Acts of Union 1800
(which abolished the Irish Parliament of that era).

Union with Great Britain (1801-1912)

Main article:
History of Ireland (1801-1923)
Daniel O'Connell
In 1800, following the
Irish Rebellion of 1798
, the Irish and the British parliaments enacted the
Acts of Union
. The merger created a new political entity called
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
with effect from 1 January 1801. Part of the agreement forming the basis of union was that the
Test Act
would be repealed to remove any remaining discrimination against Roman Catholics,
Presbyterians
,
Baptists
and other dissenter religions in the newly United Kingdom. However, King
George III
, invoking the provisions of the
Act of Settlement 1701
controversially and adamantly blocked attempts by Prime Minister
William Pitt the Younger
. Pitt resigned in protest, but his successor
Henry Addington
and his new cabinet failed to legislate to repeal or change the
Test Act
. This was followed by the first
Irish Reform Act 1832
, which allowed Catholic members of parliament but raised the property qualification to £10 effectively removing the poorer Irish freeholders from
the franchise
.
In 1823 an enterprising Catholic lawyer,
Daniel O'Connell
, known in Ireland as "The Liberator" began an ultimately successful Irish campaign to achieve emancipation and to be seated in the Parliament. This culminated in O'Connell's successful election in the Clare by-election, which revived the parliamentary efforts at reform.
The
Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829
was eventually approved by the UK parliament under the leadership of the Dublin-born Prime Minister,
Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington
. This indefatigable Anglo-Irish statesman, a former Chief Secretary for Ireland, and hero of the
Napoleonic Wars
, guided the legislation through both houses of Parliament. By threatening to resign, he persuaded
George IV
to sign the bill into law in 1829. The continuing obligation of Catholics to fund the established
Church of Ireland
, however, led to the sporadic skirmishes of the
Tithe War
of 1831-38. The Church was disestablished by the
Gladstone government
in the
Irish Church Act 1869
. The continuing enactment of parliamentary reform during the ensuing administrations further extended the initially limited franchise. Daniel O'Connell later led the
Repeal Association
in an unsuccessful campaign to undo the
Act of Union 1800
.
[53]
The
Great Irish Famine
(
An Gorta Mór
) was the second of Ireland's "Great Famines". It struck the country during 1845-49, with
potato blight
, exacerbated by the political factors of the time
[54]
leading to mass starvation and emigration. The impact of emigration in Ireland was severe; the population dropped from over 8 million before the Famine to 4.4 million in 1911.
Gaelic
or Irish, once the island's spoken language, declined in use sharply in the nineteenth century as a result of the Famine and the creation of the
National School
education system, as well as hostility to the language from leading Irish politicians of the time; it was largely replaced by English.
Outside mainstream nationalism, a series of violent rebellions by Irish republicans took place in 1803, under
Robert Emmet
; in 1848 a
rebellion
by the
Young Irelanders
, most prominent among them,
Thomas Francis Meagher
; and in 1867,
another insurrection
by the
Irish Republican Brotherhood
. All failed, but
physical force nationalism
remained an undercurrent in the nineteenth century.

Land War
, c.1879
A central issue throughout the 19th and early 20th century was land ownership. A small group of about 10,000 English families owned practically all the farmland; Most were permanent residents of England, and seldom presented the land. They rented it out to Irish tenant farmers. Falling behind in rent payments meant eviction, and very bad feelings - often violence.
[55]
The late 19th century witnessed major land reform, spearheaded by the
Land League
under
Michael Davitt
demanding what became known as the
3 Fs; Fair rent, free sale, fixity of tenure
. Parliament passed laws in 1870, 1881, 1903 and 1909 that enabled most tenant farmers to purchase their lands, and lowered the rents of the others.
[56]
From 1870 and as a result of the
Land War
agitations and subsequent
Plan of Campaign
of the 1880s, various British governments introduced a series of
Irish Land Acts
.
William O'Brien
played a leading role in the 1902
Land Conference
to pave the way for the most advanced social legislation in Ireland since the Union, the
Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903
. This Act set the conditions for the break-up of large estates and gradually devolved to rural landholders, and tenants' ownership of the lands. It effectively ended the era of the
absentee landlord
, finally resolving the Irish Land Question.
In the 1870s the issue of Irish self-government again became a major focus of debate under
Charles Stewart Parnell
, founder of the
Irish Parliamentary Party
. Prime Minister
Gladstone
made two unsuccessful attempts to pass
Home Rule
in 1886 and 1893. Parnell's leadership ended when he was implicated in a divorce scandal that gained international publicity in 1890. He had been secretly living for years with
Katherine O'Shea
, the long-separated wife of a fellow Irish MP. Disaster came quickly: Gladstone and the Liberal Party refused to cooperate with him; his party split; the Irish Catholic bishops led the successful effort to crush his minority faction at by-elections. Parnell fought for control to the end, but his body was collapsing and he died in 1891 at age 45.
After the introduction of the
Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898
which broke the power of the
landlord-dominated
"Grand Juries", passing for the first time democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils, the debate over full Home Rule led to tensions between
Irish nationalists
and
Irish unionists
(those who favoured the maintenance of the Union). Most of the island was predominantly nationalist,
Catholic
and agrarian. The northeast, however, was predominantly unionist, Protestant and industrialised. Unionists feared a loss of political power and economic wealth in a predominantly rural, nationalist, Catholic home-rule state. Nationalists believed they would remain economically and politically second-class citizens without self-government. Out of this division, two opposing sectarian movements evolved, the Protestant
Orange Order
and the Catholic
Ancient Order of Hibernians
.

to establish self-government for Ireland, but it was suspended for the duration of the war. To ensure implementation of Home Rule after the war, nationalist leaders and the IPP under Redmond supported
Ireland's participation
in the British and
Allied
war effort under the
Triple Entente
against the expansion of
Central Powers
. The core of the Irish Volunteers were against this decision, but the majority left to form the
National Volunteers
who enlisted in
Irish regiments
of the
New British Army
, the
10th
and
16th (Irish) Divisions
, their Northern counterparts in the
36th (Ulster) Division
. Before the war ended, Britain made two concerted efforts to implement Home Rule, one in May 1916 and again with the
Irish Convention
during 1917-1918, but the Irish sides (Nationalist, Unionist) were unable to agree to terms for the temporary or permanent exclusion of Ulster from its provisions.
The period 1916-1921 was marked by political violence and upheaval, ending in the
partition of Ireland
in 1920 and independence for 26 of its 32 counties. A failed militant attempt was made to gain separate independence for Ireland with the 1916
Easter Rising
, an insurrection in Dublin. Though support for the insurgents was small, the violence used in its suppression led to resentment against British rule and a swing in support of the rebels. In addition, the unprecedented
threat of Irishmen being conscripted
to the
British Army
in 1918 (for service on the
Western Front
as a result of the
German spring offensive
) accelerated this change. In the
December 1918 elections
Sinn Féin
, the party of the rebels, won three-quarters of all seats in Ireland, twenty-seven
MPs
of which assembled in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form a 32-county
Irish Republic
Parliament, the first
Dáil Éireann
unilaterally declaring
sovereignty over the entire island.
Irish parliaments
House of Lords of the Kingdom of Ireland (abolished 1800)
House of Commons of the Kingdom of 
Ireland (abolished 1800)
Leinster House
, home of the Ireland's parliament since 1922.
Parliament Buildings (Stormont)
. Previously home of
Parliament
. Now used by the

.
Unwilling to negotiate any understanding with Britain short of complete independence, the
Irish Republican Army
, the army of the newly declared Irish Republic, waged a guerilla war (the
Irish War of Independence
) from 1919 to 1921. In the course of the fighting and amid much acrimony, the Fourth
Government of Ireland Act 1920
implemented Home Rule while separating the island into what the
British government
's Act termed "
Northern Ireland
" and "
Southern Ireland
". In July 1921 the Irish and British governments agreed to a truce that halted the war. In December 1921 representatives of both governments signed an
Anglo-Irish Treaty
. The Irish delegation was led by
Arthur Griffith
and
Michael Collins
. This abolished the
Irish Republic
and created the
Irish Free State
, a self-governing
Dominion
of the
Commonwealth of Nations
in the manner of Canada and Australia. Under the Treaty,
Northern Ireland
could opt out of the Free State and stay within the United Kingdom: it promptly did so. In 1922 both parliaments
ratified the Treaty
, formalising independence for the 26-county Irish Free State (which renamed itself
Ireland
in 1937, and
declared itself a republic
in 1949); while the 6-county Northern Ireland, gaining Home Rule for itself, remained part of the United Kingdom. For most of the next 75 years, each territory was strongly aligned to either
Catholic
or
Protestant
ideologies, although this was more marked in the six counties of Northern Ireland.

Political map of Ireland
The treaty to sever the Union divided the republican movement into
anti-Treaty
(who wanted to fight on until an Irish Republic was achieved) and
pro-Treaty
supporters (who accepted the Free State as the first step towards full independence and unity). Between 1922 and 1923 both sides fought the bloody
Irish Civil War
. The new Irish Free State government defeated the anti-Treaty remnant of the
Irish Republican Army
, imposing
multiple executions
. This division among nationalists still colours Irish politics today, specifically between the two leading Irish political parties,
Fianna Fáil
and
Fine Gael
.
The new Irish Free State (1922-37) existed against the backdrop of the growth of dictatorships in mainland Europe and a major
world economic downturn
in 1929. In contrast with many contemporary European states, it remained a democracy. Testament to this came when the losing faction in the Irish civil war,
Éamon de Valera
's Fianna Fáil, was able to take power peacefully by winning the
1932 general election
. Nevertheless, until the mid-1930s, considerable parts of Irish society saw the Free State through the prism of the civil war, as a repressive, British-imposed state. It was only the peaceful change of government in 1932 that signalled the final acceptance of the Free State on their part. In contrast to many other states in the period, the Free State remained financially solvent as a result of low government expenditure, despite the
Economic War
with Britain. However, unemployment and emigration were high. The population declined to a low of 2.7 million recorded in the 1961 census.
The
Roman Catholic Church
had a powerful influence over the Irish state for much of its history. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, forbidding, for example,
divorce
,
contraception
,
abortion
,
pornography
as well as encouraging the
censoring and banning
of many books and films. In addition, the Church largely controlled the State's hospitals, and schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.
With the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.
[57]
By the 1960s the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as
Ne Temere
, whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics. From 1945, the emigration rate of Protestants fell and they became less likely to emigrate than Catholics.

In 1937 a new
Constitution
re-established the state as
Ireland
(or
Éire
in Irish). The state remained neutral throughout
World War II
(see
Irish neutrality
), which saved it from much of the horrors of the war, although tens of thousands volunteered to serve in the British forces. Ireland was also impacted by food rationing, and coal shortages;
peat production
became a priority during this time. Though nominally neutral, recent studies have suggested a far greater level of involvement by the state with the Allies than was realised, with
D Day
's date set on the basis of secret weather information on Atlantic storms supplied by Ireland. (
For more detail on 1939-45, see main article
The Emergency
.)
In 1949, Ireland left the British
Commonwealth
and was formally declared a republic.
[58]
In the 1960s, Ireland underwent a major economic change under reforming
Taoiseach
(prime minister)
Seán Lemass
and Secretary of the Department of Finance
T.K. Whitaker
, who produced a series of economic plans. Free second-level education was introduced by
Donogh O'Malley
as Minister for Education in 1968. From the early 1960s, Ireland sought admission to the
European Economic Community
but, because 90% of exports were to the United Kingdom market, it did not do so until the UK did, in 1973.
Global economic problems in the 1970s, augmented by a set of misjudged economic policies followed by governments, including that of Taoiseach
Jack Lynch
, caused the Irish economy to stagnate.
The Troubles
in Northern Ireland discouraged foreign investment. Devaluation was enabled when the Irish Pound, or Punt, was established as a separate currency in 1979, breaking the link with the UK's
sterling
. However, economic reforms in the late 1980s, helped by investment from the
European Community
, led to the emergence of one of the world's highest economic growth rates, with mass immigration (particularly of people from Asia and Eastern Europe) as a feature of the late 1990s. This period came to be known as the
Celtic Tiger
and was focused on as a model for economic development in the former Eastern Bloc states, which entered the
European Union
in the early 2000s (decade). Property values had risen by a factor of between four and ten between 1993 and 2006, in part fuelling the boom.
Irish society adopted relatively liberal social policies during this period. Divorce was legalised, homosexuality decriminalised, and abortion in limited cases was allowed by the Irish Supreme Court in the
X Case
legal judgement. Major scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, both sexual and financial, coincided with a widespread decline in religious practice, with weekly attendance at Roman Catholic
Mass
dropping by half in twenty years.
A series of tribunals
set up from the 1990s have investigated alleged malpractices by politicians, the Catholic clergy, judges, hospitals, and the Gardaí (police).
Ireland's newfound prosperity was challenged abruptly in 2008 when the
banking system
collapsed due to the
Irish property bubble
bursting. Some 25-26% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Irish banks and force banking sector consolidation. This was the largest banking bailout for any country in history, in comparison, only 7-8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Finnish banks in its banking crisis in the 1990s. This resulted in a major
financial and political crisis
as Ireland entered a
recession
.
[59]
Emigration rose to 1989 levels as the unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in 2007 to reach 14.6% as of February 2012.
[60]
However, since 2014, Ireland has seen strong economic growth, dubbed as the "
Celtic Phoenix
".

"A Protestant state" (1921-1972)
[
edit
]
The 1920 Government of Ireland Bill created the state of
Northern Ireland
, which consisted of the six northeastern counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Antrim, Down and Armagh.
[62]
From 1921 to 1972, Northern Ireland was governed by a
Unionist
government, based at
Stormont
in east Belfast. Unionist leader and first Prime Minister,
James Craig
, declared that it would be "a Protestant State for a Protestant People". Craig's goal was to form and preserve Protestant authority in the new state which was above all an effort to secure a unionist majority. In 1926 the majority of the population in the province were Presbyterian and Anglican, therefore, solidifying Craig's Protestant political power. The Ulster Unionist Party thereafter formed every government until 1972.
[63]
Discrimination against the minority Catholic community in jobs and housing, and their total exclusion from political power due to the
majoritarian electoral system
, led to the emergence of the
Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association
in the late 1960s, inspired by Martin Luther King's civil rights movement in the United States of America.
[64]
The military forces of the Northern Protestants and Northern Catholics (IRA) turned to brutal acts of violence to establish power. As time went on it became clear that these two rival states would bring about a civil war. After the Second World War, keeping the cohesion within Stormont seemed impossible; increased economic pressures, solidified Catholic unity, and British involvement ultimately led to Stormont's collapse. As the civil rights movement of the United States gained worldwide acknowledgment, Catholics rallied together to achieve a similar socio-political recognition. This resulted in the formation of various organisations such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967 and the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) in 1964.
[65]
Non-violent protest became an increasingly important factor in mobilising Catholic sympathies and opinion and thus more effective in generating support than actively violent groups such as the
IRA
. However, these non-violent protests posed a problem to Northern Ireland's prime minister Terrance O'Neil (1963) because it hampered his efforts to persuade Catholics in Northern Ireland that they too, like their Protestant counterparts, belong within the United Kingdom. Despite O'Neil's reforming efforts there was growing discontent amongst both Catholics and Unionists. In October 1968 a peaceful civil rights march in Derry turned violent as police brutally beat protesters. The outbreak was televised by international media, and as a result the march was highly publicised which further confirmed the socio-political turmoil in Ireland.
[66]
A violent counter-reaction from conservative unionists led to civil disorder, notably the
Battle of the Bogside
and the
Northern Ireland riots of August 1969
. To restore order, British troops were deployed to the streets of Northern Ireland at that time.
The violent outbreaks in the late 1960s encouraged and helped strengthen military groups such as the IRA, who served as the protectors of the working class Catholics who were vulnerable to police and civilian brutality. During the late sixties and early seventies recruitment into the IRA organisation dramatically increased as street and civilian violence worsened. The interjection from the British troops proved to be insufficient to quell the violence and thus solidified the IRA's growing military importance.
[67]
On 30 January 1972 the worst tensions came to a head with the events of
Bloody Sunday
. Paratroops opened fire on civil rights protesters in Derry, killing 13 unarmed civilians.
Bloody Friday
, Bloody Sunday, and other violent acts in the early 1970s came to be known as
the Troubles
.
The Stormont parliament was
prorogued
in 1972 and abolished in 1973. Paramilitary private armies such as the
Provisional Irish Republican Army
, resulted from a split within the IRA, the
Official IRA
and
Irish National Liberation Army
fought against the
Ulster Defence Regiment
and the
Ulster Volunteer Force
. Moreover, the
British army
and the (largely Protestant)
Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) also took part in the chaos that resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 men, women and children, civilians and military. Most of the violence took place in Northern Ireland, but some also spread to England and across the Irish border.
Direct rule (1972-1999)
[
edit
]
For the next 27
1
⁄
2
years, with the exception of five months in 1974, Northern Ireland was under "
direct rule
" with a
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
in the British Cabinet responsible for the departments of the Northern Ireland government.
Direct Rule
was designed to be a temporary solution until Northern Ireland was capable of governing itself again. Principal acts were passed by the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
in the same way as for much of the rest of the UK, but many smaller measures were dealt with by
Order in Council
with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. Attempts were made to establish a power-sharing executive, representing both the nationalist and unionist communities, by the
Northern Ireland Constitution Act
of 1973 and the
Sunningdale Agreement
in December 1973.
Both acts however did little to create cohesion between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Constitution Act of 1973 formalised the UK government's affirmation of reunification of Ireland by consent only; therefore ultimately delegating the authoritative power of the border question from Stormont to the people of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland). Conversely, the Sunningdale Agreement included a "provision of a Council of Ireland which held the right to execute executive and harmonizing functions". Most significantly, the Sunningdale Agreement brought together political leaders from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the UK to deliberate for the first time since 1925.
[68]
The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention and Jim Prior's 1982 assembly were also temporarily implemented; however all failed to either reach consensus or operate in the longer term.
During the 1970s British policy concentrated on defeating the
Provisional Irish Republican Army
(IRA) by military means including the policy of
Ulsterisation
(requiring the RUC and British Army reserve
Ulster Defence Regiment
to be at the forefront of combating the IRA). Although IRA violence decreased it was obvious that no military victory was on hand in either the short or medium terms. Even Catholics who generally rejected the IRA were unwilling to offer support to a state that seemed to remain mired in
sectarian
discrimination, and the Unionists were not interested in Catholic participation in running the state in any case. In the 1980s the IRA attempted to secure a decisive military victory based on massive arms shipments from
Libya
. When this failed, senior republican figures began to look to broaden the struggle from purely military means. In time this began a move towards
military cessation
.
In 1985 the Irish and British governments signed the
Anglo-Irish Agreement
signalling a formal partnership in seeking a political solution. The Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) recognised the Irish government's right to be consulted and heard as well as guaranteed equality of treatment and recognition of the Irish and British identities of the two communities. The agreement also stated that the two governments must implement a cross-border co-operation.
[69]
Socially and economically Northern Ireland suffered the worst levels of unemployment in the UK and although high levels of public spending ensured a slow modernisation of public services and moves towards equality, progress was slow in the 1970s and 1980s. Only in the 1990s, when progress toward peace became tangible, did the economic situation brighten. By then the demographics of Northern Ireland had undergone significant change, and more than 40% of the population was Catholic.
Devolution and direct rule (1999-present)
[
edit
]
More recently, the
Belfast Agreement
("Good Friday Agreement") of 10 April 1998 brought - on 2 December 1999 - a degree of power-sharing to Northern Ireland, giving both
unionists
and nationalists control of limited areas of government. However, both the power-sharing Executive and the elected Assembly were suspended between January and May 2000, and from October 2002 until April 2007, following breakdowns in trust between the political parties involving outstanding issues, including "decommissioning" of paramilitary weapons,
policing reform
and the removal of
British army
bases. In new elections in 2003, the moderate
Ulster Unionist
and (nationalist)
Social Democrat and Labour
parties lost their dominant positions to the more hard-line
Democratic Unionist
and (nationalist)
Sinn Féin
parties. On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and on 25 September 2005 international weapons inspectors supervised the disarmament of the majority of weapons of the PIRA. Eventually, devolution was restored in April 2007.

Ireland's economy became more diverse and sophisticated than ever before; integrating itself into the global economy by joining the
European Economic Community
(EEC), a precursor to the European Community (EC) and the
European Union
(EU), at the same time as the
United Kingdom
. By the beginning of the 1990s, Ireland had transformed itself into a modern industrial economy and generated substantial national income that benefited the entire nation. Although dependence on agriculture still remained high, Ireland's industrial economy produced sophisticated goods that rivalled international competition. Ireland's international economic boom of the 1990s became known as the
Celtic Tiger
.
The Catholic Church, which once exercised great power, found its influence on socio-political issues in Ireland much reduced. Irish bishops were no longer able to advise and influence the public on how to exercise their political rights. Modern Ireland's detachment of the Church from ordinary life can be explained by the increasing disinterest in Church doctrine by younger generations and the questionable morality of the Church's representatives. A highly publicised case was that of Eamonn Casey, the
Bishop of Galway
, who resigned abruptly in 1992 after it was revealed that he had had an affair with an American woman and had fathered a child. Further controversies and scandals arose concerning paedophile and child-abusing priests. As a result, many in the Irish public began to question the credibility and effectiveness of the Catholic Church.
[70]
In 2011 Ireland closed its embassy at the Vatican, an apparent result of this growing trend.
[71]
Flags in Ireland
[
edit
]
The
Irish tricolour
The national flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange. This flag, which bears the colours green for Irish Catholics, orange for Irish Protestants, and white for the desired peace between them, dates to the mid-19th century.
[72]
The tricolour was first unfurled in public by
Young Irelander
Thomas Francis Meagher
who, using the symbolism of the flag, explained his vision as follows:
"The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the "Orange" and the "Green," and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood"
. Fellow nationalist
John Mitchel
said of it: "I hope to see that flag one day waving as our national banner."
After its use in the
1916 Rising
it became widely accepted by nationalists as the national flag and was used officially by the
Irish Republic
(1919-21) and the
Irish Free State
(1922-37).
In 1937 when the
Constitution of Ireland
was introduced, the tricolour was formally confirmed as the national flag: "The national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange." While the tricolour today is the official flag of Ireland, it is not an official flag in Northern Ireland although it is sometimes used unofficially.
The only official flag representing
Northern Ireland
is the
Union Flag
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland however its use is controversial.
[73]
The
Ulster Banner
is sometimes used unofficially as a de facto regional flag for Northern Ireland.
Since Partition, there has been no universally accepted flag to represent the entire island. As a provisional solution for certain sports fixtures, the Flag of the
Four Provinces
enjoys a certain amount of general acceptance and popularity.
Historically a number of flags have been used, including:
Saint Patrick's Flag
(St Patrick's Saltire, St Patrick's Cross) which represented Ireland on the
Union Flag
after the Act of Union;
a green flag with a harp (used by most nationalists in the 19th century and which is also the flag of
Leinster
);
a blue flag with a harp used from the 18th century onwards by many nationalists (now the standard of the
president of Ireland
);
the
Irish tricolour
.
St Patrick's Saltire was formerly used to represent the island of Ireland by the all-island
Irish Rugby Football Union
(IRFU), before the adoption of the four-provinces flag. The
Gaelic Athletic Association
(GAA) uses the tricolour to represent the whole island.
Historiography
[
edit
]
Further information:
List of Irish historians
Ireland has a very large historiography, contributed by scholars in Ireland, North America, and Britain.
[74]
There has been both a standard interpretation and, since the late 1930s, a good deal of revisionism.
[75]
One of the most important themes has always been Irish nationalism—what Alfred Markey, calls:
the received nationalist tale replete with heroes, villains, and a host of stock elements, has a long history and has exercised a particularly important influence on the development of Irish identity.
[76]
Nationalism has led to numerous monographs and debates.
[77]
[78]
A great deal of attention has focused on the
Irish revolutionary period
, 1912-23. Starting in 2012 a series of conferences on "Reflecting on a decade of War and Revolution in Ireland 1912-1923: Historians and Public History" brought together hundreds of academics, teachers, and the general public.
[79]
Relations with Britain
[
edit
]
Ireland in some ways was the first acquisition of the British Empire.
[80]
Marshall says historians continue to debate whether Ireland should be considered part of the British Empire.
[81]
Recent work by historians pays special attention to continuing Imperial aspects of Irish history,
[82]
Atlantic Ocean history,
[83]
and the role of migration in forming the Irish diaspora across the Empire and North America.
[84]
[85]
[86]
Recent approaches
[
edit
]
As historiography evolves, new approaches have been applied to the Irish situation. Studies of women, and gender relationships more generally, had been rare before 1990; they now are commonplace with over 3,000 books and articles.
[87]
Postcolonialism
is an approach in several academic disciplines that seeks to analyze, explain, and respond to the cultural legacies of colonialism and imperialism. The emphasis is usually on the human consequences of controlling a country and establishing settlers for the economic exploitation of the native people and their land.
[88]
[89]
[90]
According to L.A. Clarkson in 1980, the 18th and 19th centuries are the best covered time frames. Recent research on 18th-century overseas trade and 19th-century agrarian conditions has broken the nationalist approach that traditionally structured Irish economic historiography. Understudied areas include economic growth and fluctuations, the labour market, capital formation, business, and history. Except for emigration, little has been written on Ireland's external economic relations in the 19th century.

Part of the
1990 Pacific typhoon season
Typhoon Page
, known in the
Philippines
as
Typhoon Tering
, was the fourth
tropical cyclone
to strike Japan in three months
[1]
and the sixth in 1990. An area of disturbed weather developed on November 5 near the
International Date Line
. For more than two weeks, the disturbance failed to develop appreciably while it tracked generally westward. The disturbance began to organize on November 17. Four days later, the disturbance was designated a tropical depression, and on November 22, the depression was classified as a tropical storm. After resuming a westward course, Page intensified into a typhoon on November 24. Page then entered a period of
rapid deepening
before plateauing in intensity early on November 26. Page turned northwest, north, and later northeast as it rounded a
subtropical ridge
. Because of the change in steering, Page began to encounter stronger wind shear, which resulted in a prolonged weakening trend. On November 30, Page, just offshore Honshu, weakened below typhoon intensity, and became an
extratropical cyclone
on the same day after making
landfall
in central
Honshu
.
Typhoon Page was the record sixth tropical cyclone to directly affect Japan that year. It also was the latest typhoon to hit the country, with the previous mark set by Typhoon Agnes of the
1948 Pacific typhoon season
. In Tokyo, 61 homes were damaged and 16 were destroyed. Elsewhere, in
Mie Prefecture
, 276 homes were damaged and 9 other homes were destroyed. Overall, four fatalities were reported and twelve others suffered injuries. A total of 162 homes were destroyed while 1,544 other houses were flooded. Nearly 35 hectares (86 acres) of farmland were damaged. Total damage was estimated at 4.8 billion yen (US$33 million).

The origins of Typhoon Page can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that was first tracked by the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center
(JTWC) at 06:00 UTC on November 5.
[2]
After forming near the
International Date Line
, the disturbance tracked northwest initially before turning west three days later.
[3]
The disturbance failed to develop appreciably due to strong easterly
wind shear
aloft. Poorly organized,
[2]
the disturbance then briefly turned west-northwest
[3]
under the influence of a
subtropical ridge
. Convection organization improved, and on November 17,
Dvorak classifications
reached T1.5/30 mph (50 km/h), which prompted the JTWC to issue a
Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert
. The
low-level center
became better defined overnight in response to decreased wind shear, and on November 19, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression.
[2]
The depression executed a counterclockwise loop for the next two days. Meanwhile, organized deep convection quickly developed over the center, and on November 21, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression by the
Japan Meteorological Agency
(JMA).
[4]
[nb 1]
At that time, the depression was located 580 km (360 mi) east-southeast of
Yap
.
[1]
At 00:00 UTC on November 22, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Page.
[2]
Several hours later, the JMA followed suit.
[6]
[nb 2]
Resuming a westward track, Page began to intensify at a faster pace on November 23 due to decreased wind shear.
[2]
The JMA upgraded Page to a
severe tropical storm
at 18:00 UTC on November 23.
[4]
Following the development of a small
eye
,
[2]
Page was upgraded into a typhoon twelve hours later by the JTWC, with the JMA following suit on the evening of November 24.
[6]
Page then entered a period of
rapid deepening
; the JTWC estimated that during a three-day period the pressure fell to 898 mbar (26.5 inHg) and the winds increased by 175 km/h (110 mph). Based on the appearance of a 75 km (45 mi) well-defined
eye
, Page was declared a super typhoon by the JTWC, the second of the month, at 06:00 UTC on November 26.
[2]
Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that typhoon attained its highest intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 255 km/h (160 mph).
[6]
Around this time, the JMA also estimated that Page peaked in intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a minimum
barometric pressure
of 910 mbar (27 inHg).
[4]
Typhoon Page, while maintaining peak strength,
[2]
began to turn northwest on the evening of November 26
[1]
as it approached a break in the
subtropical ridge
.
[2]
The next day, the typhoon turned northward
[1]
along the
125th meridian east
, then accelerated to the northeast as it rounded a ridge. As a result of the change in steering, Page began to encounter stronger
wind shear
. A loss in eye definition and a decrease in Dvorak estimates led to the JTWC downgrading Page back to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC on November 27.
[2]
The storm continued to gradually deteriorate, and on November 30, the JMA downgraded Page to a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the agency declared Page an
extratropical cyclone
as the storm passed over central
Honshu
about 130 km (80 mi) south of
Osaka
.
[1]
However, the JTWC did not downgrade Page into a tropical storm until 12:00 UTC
[6]
as wind shear continued to take toll on the system. Later that day, the JTWC issued its last warning based on a combination of land interaction with Honshu and extratropical transition.
[2]
The JMA stopped tracking the extratropical remnants of Page on December 3.
[4]

The Dybbuk
(
Yiddish
:
דער דיבוק
,
Der Dibuk
; Polish:
Dybuk
) is a
1937
Yiddish-language Polish
fantasy drama
directed by
Michał Waszyński
. It is based on the play
The Dybbuk
by
S. Ansky
.
The Dybbuk, or Between Two Worlds
(Yiddish:
דער דיבוק, אדער צווישן צוויי וועלטן
;
Der Dibuk, oder Tsvishn Tsvey Veltn
) is a 1914 play by S. Ansky, relating the story of a young bride possessed by a
dybbuk
- a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person - on the eve of her wedding.
The Dybbuk
is considered a seminal play in the history of Jewish theatre, and played an important role in the development of Yiddish theatre and theatre in Israel. The play was based on years of research by Ansky, who traveled between Jewish
shtetls
in Russia and Ukraine, documenting folk beliefs and stories of the
Hassidic Jews
.
The film, with some changes in the plot structure, starred
Lili Liliana
[
de
]
as Leah,
Leon Liebgold
as Hannan (Channon, in the English-language subtitles), and
Abraham Morewski
[
de
]
as Rabbi Azrael ben Hodos. The film adds an additional act before those in the original play: it shows the close friendship of Sender and Nisn as young men. Besides the language of the film itself, the picture is noted among film historians for the striking scene of Leah's wedding, which is shot in the style of
German Expressionism
. The film is generally considered one of the finest in the Yiddish language.
The Dybbuk
was filmed on location in
Kazimierz Dolny
, Poland, and in Feniks Film Studio in Warsaw.
[2]
Plot
[
edit
]
Two best friends, Nisan and Sender, living in a shtetl in the
Pale of Settlement
, jointly vow that the children their wives are expecting will eventually marry, against the advice of a mysterious and sinister traveller who warns against binding future generations. Sender's wife dies giving birth to their daughter Leah, and Nisan drowns in a storm at the moment his wife gives birth to their son Chanan. Sender becomes a rich but miserly rabbi in the shtetl of Britnitz, and one day Chanan arrives there as a poor
yeshiva
student. With both men unaware of their connection, Sender offers Chanan hospitality. Leah and Chanan fall in love, but knowing that Sender will not agree to marriage because of his lack of wealth, Chanan obsessively studies the
Kabbalah
and attempts to practice magic to improve his position. When he hears that Sender has arranged Leah's marriage to a rich man's son, he calls on Satan to help him. He's struck dead, but returns as a
dybbuk
, a restless spirit, who possesses Leah. The ceremony is postponed, and Sender calls on the assistance of Ezeriel, a wise and powerful rabbi in nearby Miropol (
Myropil
). Ezeriel exorcises the dybbuk, but Leah offers her soul to Chanan and dies as the mysterious stranger blows out a candle.

Weight used on a fishing line
Three types of small lead sinkers
Method feeder, a special type of sinker that holds
groundbait
A
fishing sinker
or
knoch
is a
weight
used in conjunction with a
fishing lure
or
hook
to increase its rate of sink, anchoring ability, and/or casting distance. Fishing sinkers may be as small as 1 gram (0.035 oz) for applications in shallow water, and even smaller for
fly fishing
applications, or as large as several pounds (>1 kg) or considerably more for deep sea fishing. They are formed into nearly innumerable shapes for diverse fishing applications. Environmental concerns surround the usage of
lead
and other materials in fishing sinkers.
[1]
Types
[
edit
]
Prehistoric stone fishing hook and sinker (a grooved pebble), used on the
Jordan River
during the
Late Epipalaeolithic
[2]
A large variety of sinkers exist which are used depending on the fish being pursued, the environment, the current and personal preference.
[3]
Pyramid sinkers
[
edit
]
Pyramid sinkers are shaped like a pyramid and are used when it is desirable to anchor on the bottom of water bodies. They are attached to the terminal end of fishing line by loops of
bra
.
Barrel or egg sinkers
[
edit
]
Barrel
or
egg
sinkers are rounded and often
bead
-like with a narrow hole through which fishing line is threaded. These sinkers are desirable on
rock
or
debris
covered substrates.
Split-shot sinkers
[
edit
]
Split shot (close up)
Split-
shot
sinkers are small and round with a split cutting halfway through the sinker. The split can be placed on a piece of fishing line and then crimped closed. This feature makes adding and removing the weights easy and quick.
Bullet sinkers
[
edit
]
Bullet sinkers are bullet-shaped and used widely on
largemouth bass
fishing for rigging plastic worms
"Texas-style"
.
Dipsey
[
edit
]
Dipsey sinkers are ovate or egg-shaped and are attached to the fishing line with a loop of brass wire embedded in the sinker.
Bank sinker
[
edit
]
Bank sinkers are long and ovate and have a small hole at the top for the fishing line to thread through.
Claw sinker
[
edit
]
A claw sinker consists of a sinker weight which is typically of round shape, and a number of metal wire spikes grouped around the sinker weight acting as barbs. Claw sinkers are used in
surf fishing
on sandy bottoms with strong currents, mainly to prevent the sinker from getting carried off with the current. Upon casting a claw sinker, the line is briefly tugged so that the claws will dig themselves into the sand, allowing the rig to stay in place.
Deep drop weight
[
edit
]
A deep drop weight is used to reach the bottom in deeper offshore fishing applications.  These fishing weights are typically cylindrical in  with a brass eyelet at the top for attaching to a rig.  Weights for this style of sinker range from one pound to as much as fourteen pounds.  Target species include
tilefish
,
grouper
, and
swordfish
, among others.
[4]
Materials
[
edit
]
A pyramid sinker made of
lead
, nowadays widely regarded as too
toxic
a material
An ideal material for a fishing sinker is environmentally acceptable, cheap and dense. Density is desirable as weights must be as small as possible, in order to minimize visual cues which could drive fish away from a fishing operation.
In ancient times as well as sometimes today, fishing sinkers consisted of materials found ordinarily in the natural environment, such as stones, rocks, or bone. Later, lead became the material of choice for sinkers due to its low cost, ease of production and
casting
,
chemical inertness
(resistance to corrosion), and
density
. However, lead is known to cause
lead poisoning
and enter the environment as a result of the inevitable occasional loss of fishing sinkers during routine fishing.
[5]
Thus, most lead-based fishing sinkers have been outlawed in the
United Kingdom
(under 1 oz weight),
Canada
, and some states in the
United States
. Lead based fishing sinkers are banned in all of US and Canadian
National Parks
.
[5]
These bans have motivated the use of various other materials in sinkers.
Steel
,
brass
, and
bismuth
sinkers have been marketed, but anglers have not widely adopted them due to their lower density and higher cost compared to lead.
Sandsinkers
have also been developed, using sand as weight. However, sand has a comparably low density to that of lead and makes a poor replacement.
Tungsten
is now in use, especially among
largemouth bass
anglers. Although several times costlier than lead, tungsten is just under twice as dense as lead and thus found desirable. The environmental effects of tungsten, however, are essentially unknown.
[6]
Another variant of lead-free fishing weights is presented by the Czech brand UFO Sinker, which offers weights made of heavy concrete, that can be pulled out of the water using a magnet.
More recently, terminal tackle manufacturers are experimenting with high density composite resins. These materials present a non-toxic alternative to lead sinkers at a lower monetary cost than alternative metallic sinkers.

Velvety free-tailed bat range
The
velvety free-tailed bat
or
Pallas's mastiff bat
[2]
(
Molossus molossus
), is a
bat
species in the family
Molossidae
.
Description
[
edit
]
M. molossus
is a medium-sized bat, with a length of 4 inches (100 mm) and with a wingspan of 11-13 inches (280-330 mm). This species is brown in color; however, when seen flying around at dusk, it will appear to be black. The tail of
M. molossus
is long and extends beyond the tail membrane. Its ears are large and round.
Feeding
[
edit
]
M. molossus
forages in open areas, above tree canopies, around forest edges, and around streams and ponds. Its diet includes moths, beetles, and flying ants. It is commonly seen at dusk, where it will fly solo, catching insects in the air.
Distribution and habitat
[
edit
]
It occurs in the Americas from
Argentina
north to
Cuba
and
Mexico
and also the
Florida Keys
in the
United States
.
[1]
It is very common in the Caribbean.
A
M. molossus
has been observed being killed by a giant centipede (
Scolopendra viridicornis
) in the Amazon. The lone bat had been roosting inside a man-made wooden structure in
Cristalino State Park
before the centipede grabbed it with its legs and injected venom into its neck. This observation is notable due to the rarity of centipede predation on bats.

Stefano Eranio
(
Italian pronunciation:
[ˈsteːfano
eˈraːnjo]
; born 29 December 1966) is an Italian former professional
footballer
who played as a
midfielder
. Throughout his career, Eranio played mainly as a
right winger
;
[1]
he is mostly remembered for having played for Italian clubs
A.C. Milan
, and
Genoa
, as well as English side
Derby County
, and he also represented
Italy
20 times between 1990 and 1997 at international level. His main attributes were his technique, pace, stamina, and his ability to make attacking runs.
[1]
[2]
Although he was primarily an
offensive
or wide midfielder, he was also competent defensively, and he was occasionally deployed as a
full-back
.
[3]
He was voted one of Derby County's 11 greatest ever footballers.
Club career
[
edit
]
Genoa and Milan
[
edit
]
Eranio playing for Genoa
Eranio started his professional football career with
Genoa
in August 1984. His first five seasons at Genoa were in
Serie B
, until in 1989, the club were promoted to
Serie A
. In total, Eranio played for the club for eight seasons, before moving to
AC Milan
in August 1992. At Milan he won three
league titles
(1993, 1994 and 1996), three
Italian Super Cups
(1992, 1993 and 1994) and he also played in two
Champions League
finals. The first was in 1992-93, when Milan lost 1-0 to
Olympique de Marseille
, and the second was in 1994-95 when his club lost 1-0 to
Ajax Amsterdam
. Although he was part of the team's successful Champions League campaign during the 1993-94 season, but he did not play in the final due to injury. He also added the
European Super Cup
to his trophy collection in 1994.
[4]
Derby County and Pro Sesto
[
edit
]
In May 1997 he moved on a free transfer to the English club
Derby County
, where he became a fan favourite; he made his Derby, and
FA Premier League
debut, on 9 August 1997 against
Blackburn Rovers
. His first goal for the
Derbyshire
club came on 30 August 1997 when he scored in a league game against
Barnsley
. In this season, Derby County moved from their former home at the
Baseball Ground
to their new home,
Pride Park Stadium
, and Eranio's goal, to take the score to 1-0 against Barnsley was the first that was scored at Derby's new home ground. Eranio had thought of retiring after the 2000-01 season, but manager
Jim Smith
persuaded him to stay on. When Smith resigned in October 2001, Eranio chose to leave Derby County. He retired in 2003 after spending a season with lowly fourth division
Serie C2
side
Pro Sesto
, where he was featured in a player/assistant manager position.
He is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential players to play for Derby County and, on 1 May 2006, Eranio and
Ted McMinn
were inducted as
Derby Legends
.
[5]
International career
[
edit
]
Eranio made his senior international debut for
Italy
on 22 December 1990, in a match against
Cyprus
; the game was a
qualification match
for the
UEFA Euro 1992
, and Italy won the game 4-0. His first international goal came in a friendly against the
Netherlands
on 9 September 1992; Italy won the game 3-2.
On 29 March 1997, Eranio played his last game for Italy, against
Moldova
in a 3-0 home win. In total, he received 20 caps, and scored three goals, with six of his international appearances coming in
World Cup
qualifiers
, and the other five in
European Championship qualifiers
.
[6]
Post-playing career
[
edit
]
Coaching
[
edit
]
Eranio has been part of the
A.C. Milan
youth
coaching staff since 2005, and is currently head of the
Giovanissimi Nazionali
(under-15)
youth team
.
[4]
Media
[
edit
]
On 22 October 2015, Eranio was fired by Swiss television station
RSI
following racist remarks. Criticising an error made by
Roma
defender
Antonio Rüdiger
during the 4-4 draw in the
Champions League
against
Bayer Leverkusen
, Eranio had stated: "Black players in the defensive line often make these mistakes because they’re not concentrated. They are powerful physically, but when it is time to think … they often make this type of error."

Vrčin
(
Serbian
Cyrillic
: Врчин) is a
suburban settlement
of
Belgrade
,
Serbia
. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of
Grocka
.
Name
[
edit
]
Though the village itself was mentioned much later, historians
Dušan J. Popović
and
Vladimir Ćorović
traced the name of the locality back to the
Roman period
and the nearby temple of [N]orcinium. It was dedicated to the Etruscan-Roman goddess of destiny,
Nortia
. After Slavic settlement, Roman names ending with
-cin[ium]
were mostly contracted to
čin
, while suffix
-dunum
was morphed into
din
. [N]orcinium was thus shortened to [N]orčin and then modified to Vrčin.
[1]
Geography
[
edit
]
Roadway sign
Vrčin is located southeast of
Avala
mountain, in the central-eastern part of the municipality, 20 km southeast of Belgrade and 14 km west of the municipal seat of Grocka. It is situated in the spring area of the
Bolečica
river and is a major crossroad located on the Belgrade-
Požarevac
railway, the Belgrade-
Niš
highway, a regional road connecting the highway and the road of
Smederevski put
(through
Zaklopača
) and another one connecting the highway and the Belgrade-
Kragujevac
road.
Neighborhoods
[
edit
]
Vrčin has several neighborhoods of its own. They can be roughly divided into two sections, north and south of the highway.
North section:
Cerje
(Церје) is the southernmost extension of this section. It is not connected to the rest of Vrčin in the urban sense. It is named after the
cer
,
Turkey oak
.
Donja Mala
(Доња Мала, "lower alley"), constitutes the bulk of the northern section.
Jankovići
(Јанковићи) is the  easternmost section which makes the urban connection to Zaklopača. It is named after a family surname.
Tranšped
(Траншпед) is the northern extension that is closest to Belgrade and is named after the "Tranšped" company.
South section:
Avramovići
(Аврамовићи) is a northern section named after a family surname.
Bajića Kraj
(Бајића Крај) is the eastern section  named after a family surname.
Carino Naselje
(Царино Насеље) is the south-eastern extension along the highway.
Feroplast
(Феропласт) is named for the "Feroplast" company.
Gornja Mala
(Горња Мала, "upper alley") is the central part of the entire neighborhood.
Malo Polje
(Мало Поље, "little field") is the south-western extension.
Orlovica
(Орловица, "eagle hill").
Pobrđani
(Побрђани, "hilly places"), the central-south extension.
Ravnice
(Равнице, "flat fields"), the southernmost extension.
Economy
[
edit
]
Despite the recent development of workshops and the commercial sector (including the building of a shopping mall in the center of the settlement), the economy is mostly based on agriculture.
Politics
[
edit
]
Vrčin  was once the seat of its own municipality,  which was disbanded and incorporated into the municipality of Grocka. From time to time, motions have been made proposing the separation of Vrčin from Grocka, due to the distance from its municipal seat and the fact that it is more populous than Grocka.  Recent proposals have called for the split of Vrčin and several settlements from the
Voždovac
municipality (
Zuce
,
Pinosava
,
Ripanj
,
Beli Potok
) into a new, sub-
Avalan
municipality of
Avalski Venac
.
Population
[
edit
]
Vrčin is statistically classified as a rural settlement (village) and officially is the second most populous settlement in the municipality (Census 2002; after
Kaluđerica
but ahead of the municipal seat of Grocka). However, unofficial estimates that include refugees (not counted in the official
census
reports) also put
Leštane
before Vrčin.
Vrčin extends on both sides of the highway (originally developed from the western side). The eastern extension is colloquially known as
Tranšped
(Cyrillic:
Траншпед
). This area forms a continuous build-up area with Zaklopača. Vrčin has experienced a steady growth of population:

South Vietnamese painter
Celso-Léon Lê Văn Đệ
(24 August 1906 - 16 March 1966) was a South Vietnamese painter who designed the
South Vietnamese flag
.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
A Roman Catholic, he was born in Mỏ Cày,
Bến Tre
, and was in charge of Asian Arts at the International Exhibition of Catholic Press at Vatican in 1936. He established the École supérieure nationale des Beaux Arts in Saigon.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
Some of his works have been shown at the
Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts
, Hanoi. Others are exhibited in Europe. A wall panel,
Mater Amabilis and Saint Magdalene at the food of the cross
was on show at the Missionaria Arte museum at the Vatican.
[2]
In 1930, he received a scholarship from the “Society for the Intellectual and Physical Improvement of the Indigenous People of Cochinchina” to study at the Beaux-Arts in Paris as a student of
Jean-Pierre Laurens
(1875-1932). The latter had welcomed two years earlier
Fang Ganmin
(1906-1984) who returned to China to become an influential teacher (notably of
Zao Wou-Ki
,
Chu Teh Chun
and
Wu Guanzhong
). He was in Paris when Fang fell in love with Sue Ailan (1905-1985) whom he met at the Beaux-Arts in the Humbert studio (the only one authorized to receive female students) and whom he would marry on his return to China.
Lé Van Dé was noticed in 1932 and 1933 during the Salon Officiel des Artistes Français (Paris) and obtained an “honorable mention”. In 1934, the French government bought from him a large canvas (179 X 225 cm) “
The family interior in Tonkin”
which he exhibited at the International Exhibition of Colonial Art in Naples.
[3]
He died in
Saigon

Elias Judah Durand
(20 March 1870 -- 29 October 1922) was an American
mycologist
, and
botanist
. He was one of the foremost American experts on the
discomycetes
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Elias Judah Durand was born in
Canandaigua, New York
. He received his bachelor's degree in botany and entomology from
Cornell University
in 1893 and his Doctor of Science in botany in 1895 under
George Francis Atkinson
at Cornell.
[1]
Following graduation he taught botany and mycology
[2]
at Cornell until 1910, first as a fellow and later as an instructor.
[1]
In 1910, Durand was appointed professor of botany at the
University of Missouri
,
[3]
where he remained until 1918. In 1918, Durand was named professor at the
University of Minnesota
, where from 1920 to 1921 he was the Chairman of the Department of Botany.
[4]
He remained at the University of Minnesota until his death from cancer on 29 October 1922.
[1]
[5]
[6]
Durand is buried in the Durand family plot in
Woodlawn Cemetery
in Canandaigua, New York.
[6]
He married Anna Louise Perry on 6 September 1899 and had one child, Anna Louise Durand (d. 1981), on 6 June 1901. Anna Louise died shortly after giving birth to their daughter on 11 June 1901. He married Sue Gertrude Stone (d. 1957) on 24 July 1917.
[6]
Mycological contributions
[
edit
]
Durand contributed to a broad range of botanical sciences, ranging from
bryology
and
pteridology
to mycology.
[5]
He was recognized and highly respected as an authority on discomycetes, and was one of the first Americans to study the group extensively.
[5]
[7]
His personal collection, numbering 12,087 specimens of discomycetes, including 16 types, 27 paratypes, 2 syntypes, and 6,000 microscope slides, was deposited in the Plant Pathology Herbarium at Cornell University (CUP), helping establish that herbarium as a leading center for the study of discomycetes.
[4]
[5]
Durand's collections included 650 types (mostly discomycetes) from other authors and herbaria, currently stored at Cornell University.
[4]
Additional specimens Durand collected are stored in the herbaria of the
Field Museum of Natural History
, the
University of Kentucky
, the
University of Minnesota
, the
New York Botanical Garden
, and
Pomona College
.
[8]
Taxa described and new combinations
[
edit
]
E.J. Durand described a total of 25 new species, one new form, one new variety, and made 20 new combinations of species. As of 2014
, nine of his species and ten recombinations are still accepted (having not been assigned to another genus or reduced to
synonymy
under previously published names). Durand also described two genera,
Gloeoglossum
and
Ionomidotis
which were both later reduced to synonymy.

Mycological lineage
[
edit
]
Durand earned his Doctorate of Science under G.F. Atkinson at Cornell. Durand belongs to the mycological lineage of
William Russel Dudley
. Dudley was a student and assistant under
Albert Nelson Prentiss
, who was the first head of the Department of Botany at Cornell University.
[7]
Dudley mentored G.F. Atkinson who later returned to Cornell when Dudley left in 1892.
[7]
[11]
While Durand did not directly mentor any students who would later become professional mycologists, he was well-regarded as an instructor in undergraduate courses.
[1]
[5]
Honors and memberships
[
edit
]
While a student at Cornell, Durand was a member of Sigma Xi,
Quill and Dagger
, Congress, the Classical Association, and the Natural History Society (of which he was president in his senior year).
[6]
Durand was a charter member of the
American Mycological Society
(which merged with the
Botanical Society of America
in 1903).
[12]
He was also a member of the
American Phytopathological Society
and the
American Association for the Advancement of Science
.

Undead monster in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth
Barrow-wights
are
wraith
-like creatures in
J. R. R. Tolkien
's world of
Middle-earth
. In
The Lord of the Rings
, the four hobbits are trapped by a barrow-wight, and are lucky to escape with their lives; but they gain ancient swords of
Westernesse
for their quest.
Tolkien derived the idea of barrow-wights from
Norse mythology
, where heroes of several
Sagas
battle
undead
beings known as
draugrs
. Scholars have noted a resemblance, too, between the breaking of the barrow-wight's spell and the final battle in
Beowulf
, where
the dragon
's barrow is entered and the treasure released from its spell.
Barrow-wights do not appear
in
Peter Jackson
's
film trilogy
, but they do feature in
computer games
based on Tolkien's Middle-earth.
Origins
[
edit
]
In the
Grettis saga
, Grettir (pictured) fights Kárr, an
undead
who guards his own barrow.
[1]
17th-century Icelandic manuscript
A
barrow
is a burial mound, such as was used in
Neolithic
times.
[2]
A
wight
, from
Old English
:
wiht
, is a person or other sentient being.
[3]
[4]
There are tales of wights, called
vǣttr
or
draugr
,
undead
grave-spirits with bodies, in
Norse mythology
.
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
In Norway, country people in places such as
Eidanger
considered that the dead went on living in their tombs as
vetter
or protective spirits, and up to modern times continued to offer sacrifices on the grave-mounds.
[9]
Tolkien stated in his "Nomenclature of
The Lord of the Rings
" that "barrow-wight" was an "invented name", rather than one like "
orc
" that existed in Old English.
[10]
[5]
He explained further in a lecture on
Beowulf
that
orcneas
("hell-corpses"), the evil monsters born of
Cain
and leading to the monster
Grendel
, meant:
[T 1]
that terrible northern imagination to which I have ventured to give the name 'barrow-wights'. The 'undead'. Those dreadful creatures that inhabit tombs and mounds. They are not living: they have left humanity, but they are 'undead'. With superhuman strength and malice they can strangle men and rend them. Glámr in the story of Grettir the strong is a well-known example.
[T 1]
However, the term was used by
Andrew Lang
in his 1891
Essays in Little
, where he wrote "In the graves where treasures were hoarded the Barrowwights dwelt, ghosts that were sentinels over the gold."
[5]
Eiríkr Magnússon
and
William Morris
used it, too, in their 1869 translation of
Grettis saga
, which features a fight with the "barrow-wight" or "barrow-dweller", Kárr:
[11]
[12]
Everything in their way was kicked out of place, the barrow-wight setting on with hideous eagerness; Grettir gave back before him for a long time, till at last it came to this, that he saw it would not do to hoard his strength any more; now neither spared the other, and they were brought to where the horse-bones were, and thereabout they wrestled long. And now one, now the other, fell on his knee; but the end of the strife was, that the barrow-dweller fell over on his back with huge din.
[12]
The
Grettis Saga
further links the defeat of the barrow-wight to the recovery of an ancient treasure, which comes to the sight of the heir of the house to which it had once belonged:
[12]
Grettir ... cast down on the table all the treasure he had taken in the barrow; but one matter there was thereof, on which he must needs keep his eyes; this was a short sword, so good a weapon, that a better, he said, he had never seen; and this he gave up the last of all. Thorfinn was blithe to see that sword, for it was an heirloom of his house, and had never yet gone out of his kin.
"Whence came these treasures to thine hand?" said Thorfinn.
[12]
The
Grettis Saga
calls the undead monsters Glámr and Kárr
haugbúar
("mound-dwellers", singular
haugbúi
; a similar term is
draugr
). It influenced Tolkien's barrow-wights, whether directly from the Old Norse or by way of Magnússon and Morris's translation.
[13]
Barrow-wights have appeared in Scandinavian literature in the modern era, for instance in the Swedish poet
Carl Michael Bellman
's 1791 song no. 32
Träd fram du Nattens Gud
("Step forth, thou god of night"), whose second stanza runs (translated):
[14]
Your quilt covers everything... Look at Flora's gardens!
Here the most beautiful heights flee, there dark Barrow-wights (
griftevårdar
)
stand on black hills;
and under owls' crying moles, snakes, and martens
leave their chambers.
Both the barrow-wight and the character
Tom Bombadil
first appeared in Tolkien's writings in his poem
The Adventures of Tom Bombadil
, published in the
Oxford Magazine
of 15 February 1934.
[T 2]
[15]
Lord of the Rings
narrative
[
edit
]
"Two huge standing stones" like a doorway:
[T 3]
A
long barrow
, the
dolmen
at
Locmariaquer
, Brittany. The chamber is a passage with wider places for burials and
grave-goods
.
Grave goods such as leaf-shaped swords are found in the
Hallstatt culture
of the
Late Bronze Age in Europe
.
Evil spirits were sent to the
Barrow-downs
by the
Witch-king
of
Angmar
to prevent the restoration of the destroyed
Dúnedain
kingdom of Cardolan, one of three remnants of the
Dunedain
Kingdom of
Arnor
.
[T 3]
[T 4]
They animated the dead bones of the Dúnedain, as well as older bones of
Edain
from the
First Age
, which still were buried there.
[T 4]
After leaving
Tom Bombadil
,
Frodo Baggins
and company are trapped in the Barrow-downs, and nearly killed by a barrow-wight:
[T 3]
Suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door, two huge standing stones... He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him.
[T 3]
Frodo manages to resist the wight's spell; looking about, he sees the other hobbits dressed in grave-goods, in thin white clothes with gold circlets and chains, swords and shields around them, and a sword lying across their necks. He seizes a small sword and cuts off the wight's hand. When the wight extinguishes the dim light in the cavern, Frodo calls for
Tom Bombadil
, who expels the wight from the barrow, rescues the hobbits, and recovers the wight's treasure-hoard, which included ancient
Númenórean
swords. Frodo sees the separated hand continuing to wriggle by itself.
[T 3]
[15]
The
cairn
was that of the last prince of Cardolan;
[T 4]
Merry
's exclamation on waking from his trance confirms this, as he names
Carn Dûm
, capital of the
Witch-Kingdom of Angmar
, continually at war with the Númenórean realms (and as Bombadil later explains):
[T 3]
Of course, I remember! The men of Carn Dûm came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! The spear in my heart!
[T 3]
Bombadil arms the hobbits from the barrow-wight's hoard with what become known as
barrow-blades
:
For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.
[T 3]
When, much later,
Pippin
offers his service to the
Steward of Gondor
,
Denethor
, the old man examines his sword and asks "Whence came this? ... Many, many years lie on it. Surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?"
[T 5]
Significance
[
edit
]
Further information:
Beowulf and Middle-earth
The Tolkien scholar
Tom Shippey
comments that it is a "great moment" when Merry awakens in the barrow from the wight's spell and "remembers only a death not his own". He observes that Merry has taken on the warrior's personality, not that of the wight, since Tom recalls the dead with affection. That leaves, Shippey writes, the question of who or what the wight was as a mystery. The deathly-white robes, the writhing hand, the hobbits arrayed for death, give the thrill of fantasy, but this is given solidity by being tied into a wider history which is at least hinted at.
[15]
The literature scholar Patrick Callahan notes that the whole Bombadil episode seems disconnected from the rest of the story, but that the barrow-wight story resembles the final fight in
Beowulf
, when the king, now old, goes out to do battle with the barrow-dragon. He dies, but the funeral-barrow's treasure is recovered and the curse on it is broken, just as with the barrow-wight's. Callahan observes, too, that the barrow-wight belongs to "the class of
revenants
, or 'walking dead'", as in the
Grettis saga
which Tolkien knew.
[1]
In contemporary media
[
edit
]
Peter Jackson
omitted barrow-wights from his
The Lord of the Rings
film trilogy
. The humanities scholar
Brian Rosebury
argues that the removal is acceptable to reduce running time, because the episode does not fundamentally change the story.
[16]
On the other hand, the Tolkien scholar
John D. Rateliff
notes that, since the Hobbits failed to acquire ancient blades from the barrow-wight's hoard, they awkwardly receive their swords from their travel-companion
Aragorn
on
Weathertop
as the party is threatened with imminent attack; he coincidentally happens to be carrying four Hobbit-sized swords with him, despite only expecting to meet Frodo and
Sam
.
[17]
Despite their
omission from the film trilogy
, Barrow-wights appear in games such as
The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game
.
[18]
[19]
A barrow-wight features in the low-budget 1991 Russian adaptation of
The Fellowship of the Ring
,
Khraniteli
.

Martin Baldwin Kittel
Martin Baldwin Kittel
(6 January 1796/97/98 - 1885) known as Martin Balduin, and Baldwin Martin, was born in
Aschaffenburg
on 6 January, the year given variously as 1796, 1797 or 1798, in "humble circumstances".
[1]
He passed his
baccalaureate
in 1816, and enrolled to study
philosophy
at the
University of Würzburg
. He was made a Doctor of Medicine in Munich in 1822, although he never practiced as a doctor. Three years later, he travelled to Paris to study science, and in 1831 was appointed professor at the
Lyceum Aschaffenburger
, where he remained until his retirement in 1873.  A man of great industry, he also applied himself to the study of
botany
,
geology
, local history, and art history.
He married Hulda Wilhelmine Leske (1819-1842); they had one child, a daughter, Petra Katharina. A man noted for his humility, Kittel died on 24 July 1885, and was buried in the old town cemetery in Aschaffenburg.

Defunct Scottish shipbuilding company
Fleming and Ferguson
was a Scottish
marine engineering
and
shipbuilding
company that traded between 1877 and 1969.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
1877-1914
[
edit
]
William Y. Fleming and Peter Ferguson (1840-1911) founded the company in
Paisley
,
Scotland
in 1877, making
marine steam engines
.
[1]
In 1885 they expanded into shipbuilding by taking over the business and Phoenix Shipyard of H. McIntyre & Co.,
[1]
which had built
PS
Waverley
(1885)
for
Campbell
of
Kilmun
.
[2]
Fleming and Ferguson became a private company in 1895 and a public
limited company
in 1898.
[1]
In 1903 the Ferguson family withdrew from the business
[1]
and set up their own shipyard,
Ferguson Shipbuilders
, at
Port Glasgow
. However, Fleming and Ferguson survived their departure and developed a World-class reputation for reciprocating engines and small ships.
[1]
In 1889 Fleming and Ferguson built the
cargo ship
Singapore
with
quadruple-expansion engines
.
[1]
By 1894 Fleming and Ferguson were also making
water-tube boilers
, which were featured in an article in
The Engineer
.
[1]
The firm also built reciprocating engines for non-marine use. In 1904 it supplied two inverted
triple-expansion engines
for a water company in
Brighton
.
[1]
In the 1890s the company entered the specialist market for "knock down" vessels. These were bolted together at the shipyard, all the parts marked with numbers, disassembled into many hundreds of parts and transported in kit form for final reassembly with rivets. This elaborate method of construction was used to provide inland vessels for export. In 1898 it built the
stern wheel paddle steamer
PS
Premier
and exported it in sections for reassembly at
Maryborough, Queensland
in Australia.
The firm's main specialisms were vessels such as
dredgers
,
barges
,
tugboats
,
floating cranes
,
lighthouse tenders
and, in 1904, the
icebreaker
Champlain
. Occasionally it also built
steam yachts
. In peacetime it also took one
Admiralty
order, the
minelayer
Lady Roberts
built in 1901 for service in
New Zealand
. In 1914 it had a workforce of 1,000.
[1]
First World War
[
edit
]
In the
First World War
it built the
Racecourse-class
minesweepers
HMS
Lingfield
and

1945-69
[
edit
]
In 1946 Fleming and Ferguson built the
East African Railways and Harbours Corporation
stern wheel paddle steamer
PS
Lugard II
, which plied the
Albert Nile
in Uganda. In 1964 the American Marine and Machinery Co. Inc. bought Fleming and Ferguson.
[1]
The company's final ship was a dredger that it built speculatively.
[1]
Fleming and Ferguson ceased trading before completing the vessel so Hugh Maclean of
Renfrew
completed her.
[1]
The dredger, yard number 804, was eventually named
Bled
and exported to
Yugoslavia
.

was the fourth

improved Schwaben-class
Zeppelin
that first flew on 3 May 1913 and  operated as a passenger airship with
DELAG
(
Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft
) until
WWI
, when it was commandeered for service with the
Imperial German Army
. After being transferred to the
Imperial German Navy
, LZ17 was dismantled in 1916.
History
[
edit
]
From its introduction until the beginning of
WWI
, LZ 17 carried 9837 people in 419 flights,
[1]
mainly on sightseeing flights in the service of
DELAG
, primarily between
Dresdsen
,
Leipzig
,
Potsdam
,
Hamburg
,
Friedrichshafen
, Baden-Oos, and
Leignitz
.
On 1 August 1914 LZ 17 was transferred to the
Imperial German Army
and equipped with bomb racks capable of carrying up to 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of bombs as well as machine guns.
Peter Strasser
, leader of the Imperial German Navy airship service, received his training on board the airship in 1914 and shortly thereafter it took part in several raids against
Antwerp
.
[2]
It quickly became clear that the airship was not suitable for warfare on the western front, and as a result was transferred to
Allenstein
in early 1915, continuing with smaller raids on
Białystok
and
Ciechanów
throughout the year.
Damaged during a landing, LZ17 was shortened to 148 m (486 ft), and its carrying capacity reduced to 7,400 kg (16,300 lb) and the performance of the engines was also increased to 130 kW (180 hp) during repairs. As
LZ 17A
, the airship was transferred to the
Imperial German navy
at
Königsberg
, where it was decommissioned 12 months later, in 1916, as one of Germany's most successful small airships.

. The film was released on March 3, 2021, by

and received mixed reviews from critics.
Plot
[
edit
]
Vivian is 16, lives with her mother Lisa, and attends Rockport High School. One day she joins her best friend Claudia at a class taught by Mr. Davies. Vivian notices classmate Seth, has gotten more attractive over the summer. He used to be called Seth "The Shrimp". Mr. Davies introduces new student Lucy, then begins a discussion of
The Great Gatsby
, a novel about a mysterious millionaire. She criticizes it as another tale of a rich white guy expressing sorrow over not having the woman he wants. The star
jock
Mitchell interrupts Lucy's opinion and defends the
Jay Gatsby
character.
Later, Vivian sees Mitchell taking the soda Lucy was trying to buy and spitting in it. When Lucy reports Mitchell to Principal Shelly, she doesn't want to penalize Mitchell and tries to avoid getting involved.
At home, Vivian goes through Lisa's stuff and finds her old feminist
zines
and gets inspired. Next day at school, the students discover a list labeling young women made by a group of jocks shared to everyone's phone. Many girls are embarrassed by it, in which the jocks express many sexist and perverse opinions, which makes them self-conscious. When Mitchell calls Lucy a foul word, Vivian becomes inspired by her feminist mother and starts "Moxie", a zine aimed at
calling out
the unfair treatment of girls at the school, and empowering them to raise their concerns.
Vivian befriends Lucy, as well as a group of other girls who have been put down, but her best friend Claudia is reluctant to get behind the movement and it causes a rift between them. Vivian also begins a relationship with Seth, who knows she started "Moxie" and supports her.
After Mitchell wins an athletic scholarship over the girls' favorite candidate, Kiera, Vivian walks home feeling depressed, drinking a bottle of champagne along the way. She comes home to find Lisa with her boyfriend John, and is annoyed that her mother kept the relationship a secret from her. Vivian then throws up.
Later, the "Moxie" girls respond to Mitchell winning the award by putting crude stickers all over the school. Principal Shelly, who was called out by "Moxie" for not supporting the girls, attempts to shut down the group. Claudia, who eventually joins the group, takes the fall for the stickers.
Vivian then hits a low point when Claudia criticizes her for not coming forward (she knew Vivian started "Moxie"), while also having a rough patch with Seth. She also faces challenges with her mother after she yells at Lisa and John during dinner.
Vivian finds a note from an anonymous girl who says she was raped the previous year. Vivian gets "Moxie" supporters to stage a
walkout
in support of the girl. The majority of students participate, and Vivian reveals that she started "Moxie".
Head cheerleader Emma comes forward as the rape survivor, stating that Mitchell, her ex-boyfriend, was her rapist. It happened the previous year when they were dating, and they called her "Most Bangable", which left her mortified. All the students are horrified and lend their support. Principal Shelly overhears and plans to punish Mitchell at last.
Vivian reconciles with her mom, Claudia, and Seth, and "Moxie" gains more followers. Lisa expresses pride in her daughter and the girls throw a party in celebration of "Moxie".

comes up a little short on its titular ingredient when it comes to fully addressing its story's timely themes, but this sweet coming-of-age story is still easy to like."

On
Metacritic
, it has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
[10]
Rasha Jameel, writing in
The Daily Star
, accused the film of
tokenism
. Criticizing its "careless" insertion of the "
white savior
" trope, Jameel wrote, "the film adds characters of colour and a white character with
disability
, but instead of allowing these characters to speak or act on their behalf, the narrative is told primarily through the all-too-common perspective of a
privileged white
American."

Background
[
edit

"Will Ye No Come Back Again" was recorded in the studio on 1, 7 and 8 August 1975. The Scotland location footage was filmed in
Applecross
in
Wester Ross
from 6 to 9 May.
[1]
The idea behind part of the plot, regarding

Laxdale Hall
, which was written and produced by
Alfred Shaughnessy
, the script editor of
Upstairs, Downstairs
.
[1]
The only main cast member needed for the location scenes was Gordon Jackson, who was provided with a
double
so he was only needed for one day of filming.
[1]
Despite being the twelfth episode to air, "Will Ye No Come Back Again" was the last episode of

Plot
[

Virginia
, Alice, and
Rose
have gone to Paris. Richard, James, Georgina, and the servants go to stay in a house owned by Lord Berkhamstead in the
Scottish Highlands
. First to arrive are Hudson, Mrs. Bridges, Daisy and Ruby, only to find that there is no electricity as the generator is said to be broken, their grocery order has not arrived, and there is no
wood
for the fire. On the first evening Roderick McKay, Lord Berkhamstead's
head ghillie
, arrives and tells the servants the story of how the first
laird
died at the house after being mortally wounded at the
Battle of Culloden
. McKay says that the laird returns as a ghost on a
handcart
during the night. That evening Ruby hears a cart. When she hears the same sound a second night, she screams.
The following morning, James gets ready to go
fly fishing
until McKay tells him that there are no fish in the river. Richard goes to stay with a friend for a few days; while he is away James tells Georgina of his love for her. However, Georgina says that she does not love him in the same way anymore. James then leaves very early the following morning for London. Meanwhile, looking for the generator, Hudson and Edward find a room that has recently been used to prepare fish. During the night Hudson sees McKay and others
poaching
salmon. McKay and Hudson then come to a "
gentlemen's agreement
" that McKay will ensure there are fish for James, and the electricity and hot water also soon start to work. McKay also reveals that the noises Ruby heard were made by him.
When they get back to London, Richard and Georgina get a
telegram
from James saying he has gone to
Liverpool
, en route to visit
Elizabeth

; born
Alfred Schütz
,
German:
[ʃʏts]
; 1899-1959) was an Austrian
philosopher
and
social phenomenologist
whose work bridged
sociological
and
phenomenological
traditions. Schutz is gradually being recognized as one of the 20th century's leading
philosophers of social science
.
[1]
: xv
He related
Edmund Husserl
's work to the social sciences, using it to develop the philosophical foundations of
Max Weber
's sociology, in his major work
Phenomenology of the Social World
.
[2]
However, much of his influence arose from the publication of his
Collected Papers
in the 1960s.
[3]
Biography
[
edit
]
Schutz was born on 13 April 1899 in
Vienna
, Austria, as the only child in an upper-middle-class Jewish family. Following his graduation from high school, he was drafted into the
Austrian Army
where he quickly rose to the American equivalent rank of second lieutenant. His army regiment was dispatched to fight in a series of heavy battles on the
Italian front
(WWI).
Education and later life
[
edit
]
In 1918, Schutz enrolled at the
University of Vienna
, where he earned his law degree.
[4]
He also enrolled at the Viennese Academy of International Trade from 1919 to 1920, specialising in international law. During his time at the University of Vienna, attending lectures given by
Max Weber
, Schutz came to the conclusion that Weber had left the problem of
meaning
unexplicated.
[5]
As noted by Wagner (1983), Schutz's fascination with this problem was a result of his experience in combat, combined with returning to starving and economically decimated Vienna.
[6]
Schutz married Ilse Heim in 1926. Partly because there were few academic posts available, he developed a well-established and prominent career in international banking, He became the chief financial officer for Reitler and Company, the Vienna banking firm. His academic work was done in his spare time. He was once described by
Edmund Husserl
as “a banker by day and a philosopher by night.”
[2]
In 1933, the threat of
Adolf Hitler
's rise in Germany caused Schutz and other Viennese intellectuals to flee Austria and seek asylum in allied countries.  Schutz and his family relocated to Paris in 1938 in political exile. He continued to work for Reitler and Company as an international lawyer. He moved to the United States in 1939, where he became a part-time faculty member of
The New School
. There, he taught sociology and philosophy, as well as serving as chair of the Philosophy department. Schutz received a substantial amount of assistance from his wife, Ilse, who transcribed his working notes and letters from his taped dictations.
[7]
Schutz died on 20 May 1959 in
New York City
at the age of 60.
[8]
Four volumes of Collected Papers were published posthumously, along with the draft of a second book he had been working on prior to his death.
[9]
Intellectual career
[
edit
]
Schutz was strongly influenced by
Ludwig von Mises
,
[10]
Henri Bergson
,
William James
, and
Edmund Husserl
, as well as
Max Weber
.
Drawing on
phenomenology
, Schutz's principal aim was to create a philosophical foundation for the
social sciences
. While Schutz's work paralleled
George Herbert Mead
’s analysis of the meanings within social interactions, Schutz was highly critical of Mead’s
behavioristic
approach.
[1]
: xviii
Although Schutz was never a student of Husserl, he and colleague
Felix Kaufmann
intensively studied Husserl's work in order to seek a basis for Weber's interpretive sociology and for
Austrian economic
theory.
[11]
In 1932, Schutz’s efforts resulted in his first published book,
Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt
('The Meaningful Structure of the Social World') which was published in English as
The Phenomenology of the Social World
. Schutz argues that social science must be grounded in analysis of what Husserl referred to as 'the natural attitude', the assumptions that structure everyday perceptions and actions in the social world. Schutz retains Weber's conception of social science as properly committed to the principle of value neutrality, but also to value relevance, and that its investigations must rely on “
ideal types
”. He viewed the technique of bracketing, drawn from
Husserlian phenomenology
, as a way beyond the limitations of ideal-type analysis.
[12]
This publication brought him to the attention of Husserl, whom he visited frequently and corresponded with until Husserl's death in 1938. Even so, when Husserl asked Schutz to be his assistant, he was unable to accept the offer at
Freiburg University
for personal reasons.
[1]
: xviii
Schutz's main area of concern was the ways in which people grasp the consciousness of others while living within their own streams of consciousness. He spoke much about
intersubjectivity
, in a broader sense, using it in reference to the
social world
, specifically the
social nature
of knowledge. A great deal of his work deals with the "
lifeworld
," in which people create social reality under the constraints of preexisting social and cultural factors and structures. He was very focused on the "dialectical relationship between the way people construct social reality and the obdurate social and cultural reality that they inherit from those who preceded them in the social world."
[13]
Schutz is also known for his belief that humans attempt to
typify
everything; i.e., to categorize people and things to better understand them within the context of society. He believed that the various typifications we use inform how we understand and interact with people and objects in the social world.
Schutz's theories and conceptions are illuminated through an intense and insightful correspondence with Harvard scholar
Talcott Parsons
.
[14]
The thrust of the discussion centered on the meaning of the concept "
social action
." Whether the Schutz-Parsons correspondence can be characterized as “dialogue” rather than “debate” has been analyzed by Rehorick (1980).
[15]
Further insights into the fundamental differences between Schutz and Parsons is provided by a critical examination of original correspondence that brought in a third scholarly voice—that of
Eric Voegelin
.
[16]
This discussion shows that conceptual and theoretical differences between Schutz and Parsons stem from different “ways of knowing,” implying fundamentally different orientations toward social scientific thought.
Legacy
[
edit
]
Schutz's writings have had a lasting impact on the social sciences, both on
phenomenological approaches to sociology
and in
ethnomethodology
(through the writings of
Harold Garfinkel
). Heavily influenced by Schutz's work as his student,
Thomas Luckmann
ultimately finished Schutz's work on the structures of the
lifeworld
by filling out his unfinished notes after Schutz died. As noted by Farganis (2011),
Peter L. Berger
, also a student of Schutz's, was arguably the best-known living sociologist influenced by Schutz, especially through his creation of the
social construction
theory, which explains how the processes of
externalization
,
objectification
, and
internalization
contribute to the social construction of reality.
[17]
Berger and Luckmann went on to use Schutz's work to further understand human culture and reality, through the development of a new form of the
sociology of knowledge
.
[18]
Phenomenology
[
edit
]
Phenomenology
is the study of things as they appear (i.e.,
phenomena
). It is also often said to be descriptive rather than explanatory: a central task of phenomenology is to provide a "clear, undistorted description of the ways things appear."
[19]
Phenomenology originated with
Edmund Husserl
, who Schutz studied and even met. There are many assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its creation. First, it rejects the concept of objective research: phenomenologists would rather group presumptions through a process called
phenomenological epoche
. Second, phenomenology believes that analyzing the daily human behavior will provide one with a comprehensive understanding of nature. The third assumption is that persons, not individuals, should be explored and questioned. Sociologically speaking, this is in part because persons can be better understood by the unique ways they reflect and symbolize the society they live in. Fourth, phenomenologists prefer to gather
capta
, or
conscious experience
, rather than traditional data. Finally, phenomenology is considered to be oriented on discovery, and therefore phenomenologists gather research using methods that are far less restricting than in other sciences.
[20]
Social phenomenology
[
edit
]
Social phenomenology is concerned with how people use ordinary, everyday interactions to produce a feeling of reality and intersubjectivity. Most of Schutz's work concerned the methods used for the construction of reality through everyday experiences.
[21]
The social construction of reality and
ethnomethodology
are disciplinary extensions beyond the social phenomenology of Alfred Schutz.
[22]
As noted by Farganis (2011),
phenomenological sociology
is characterized as particularly subjective in nature because its emphasis of understanding reality through the perspective of the acting subject rather than through the lens of the scientific observer.
[23]
Rather than attempting to uncover and document the social structures which influence our social world Schutz and other sociological phenomenologists seek not only to identify the content of our consciousness related to our conception of the social reality of everyday life but also, how this reality comes to assume the form it is.
[23]
In essence, Schutz and social phenomenologists are principally concerned with the happenings of everyday life, or what Schutz refers to as the
lifeworld
, “an
intersubjective
world in which people both create social reality and are constrained by the preexisting social and cultural structures created by their predecessors."
[24]
Within this world, relationships between the social and natural world are what come into doubt. There is this existence of meaning that comes into play, yet most people simply accept the world how it is and never second guess the concept or problem of meaning. Schutz delves even more into specific relationships such as the difference between intimate face-to-face relationships and distant and impersonal relationships.
The four divisions of the lifeworld
[
edit
]
Schutz's division of Husserl's
lebenswelt
(the mundane '
lifeworld
') into four distinct sub-worlds is perhaps his most influential theoretical contribution. The theory of the lifeworld is that social experience creates a world that is separated between:
[1]
: xxvii
the social reality that has been directly experienced; and
social reality that is on the horizon of direct experience.
The former consists of the
umwelt
('environment'), the environment defined through the perception and action of agents. The latter refers to an environment of consociates, or fellow-men; of the man who "shares with me a community of space and a community of time."
[25]
: 163
In contrast, those who Schutz did not deem his fellow-men, he put them in three classes:
[1]
: xxvii
the world of contemporaries (
mitwelt
);
the world of predecessors (
vorwelt
); and
the world of successors (
folgewelt
).
The last two represent the past and the future, whereas one's contemporaries share a community of time, if not space, and are different from the predecessors and successors because it is possible for them to become fellow-men or consociates.
[1]
: xxvii
Schutz was interested in documenting the transition from direct to indirect experience and the series of experiences in between.
[25]
: 177
He also wanted to map the progressive
anonymisation
of the contemporaries (
mitwelt)
, which was a measurement of increasing anonymity of "my absent friend, his brother whom he has described to me, the professor whose books I have read, the postal clerk, the Canadian Parliament, abstract entities like Canada herself, the rules of English grammar, or the basic principles of jurisprudence."
[1]
: xxviii
Schutz argued that the more one goes into the contemporary world, the more anonymous the contemporary inhabitants become, with the most anonymous being artifacts of any kind that hold meaning, context, and suggest there are unknown people.
[25]
: 181
In his later writings, Schutz explored how everyday social experiences that pertain to these dimensions are most often intertwined in varying degrees of anonymity.
[26]
For instance:
[27]
[I]f in a face-to-face relationship with a friend I discuss a magazine article dealing with the attitude of the President and Congress toward China, I am in a relationship not only with the perhaps anonymous contemporary writer of the article but also with the contemporary individual or collective actors on the social scene designated by the terms, 'President', 'Congress', 'China'

are:
Winner of the
2014 MLS Cup

6
For this season only, the highest placed Canadian team will be awarded Canada's place in the
2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League
, as a result of the rescheduling of the

The
Defoe Shipbuilding Company
was a small ship builder established in 1905 in
Bay City, Michigan
, United States.  It ceased to operate in 1976 after failing to renew its contracts with the
United States Navy
.  The site of the former company is now being developed for business and housing on the bank of the
Saginaw River
.
Founding
[
edit
]
Harry J. Defoe
organized the Defoe Boat and Motor Works in 1905 on the Saginaw River in Bay City, Michigan.  At that time, the firm built "knock-down" boats and gasoline powered boats for business and pleasure.  In 1917, the company got its first Navy contract for five
Spent Torpedo Chasers
.  This order was followed in 1918 by an order for eight
steel
Tumor Mine Planters
.

Defoe Shipbuilding WWII 1944
From 1920 to 1939, the company built various types of government and commercial vessels and private yachts, including three 165-ft patrol boats, thirteen 100-ft patrol boats,
[1]
fifteen
75-foot patrol boats
[2]
and two harbor tugs for the
U.S. Coast Guard
. In 1931, Defoe built the
Lenore
, a 92-foot (28 m) yacht for
Montgomery Ward
Chairman
Sewell Avery
, who named it after his second
daughter
who died at the age of four; this yacht was taken by the
U.S. Government
in
World War II
for coastal
picket
duty by the
Coast Guard
, and in 1956 it was assigned as a Presidential
Yacht
.  It was called the
Barbara Anne
by President
Eisenhower
after his granddaughter, the
by President
Kennedy
in honor of his maternal grandfather
John Francis Fitzgerald
, and the
Tricia
by President
Nixon
after his daughter.  In 1941, the name of the company was changed to Defoe Shipbuilding Company.
World War II
[
edit
]
USS Weiss (APD-135)
During
World War II
, all production went to the war effort.  From 1939 to 1945, the company built 154 ships, including four
Auk
-class
minesweepers
, 17
destroyer escorts
(of those 3 were converted to APDs after serving as DEs for some time), 11
High speed transports
(APDs) (converted destroyer escorts, but launched as such),
patrol craft
, and numerous
landing craft
of various types. The brand-new Defoe family yacht even served with the US Navy as a patrol vessel.  Defoe developed a construction technique called the "upside-down and roll-over" method.  This allowed most of the
welding
of the
hull
to be done "hand down" which is much easier. After the hull was completely welded, it was rolled over by a set of large wheels fastened to each end of the hull.  Work then continued on the ship right-side up.  Faster welding allowed the company to build one 173-foot patrol craft every week.  Of all of the major ships built there, the three that were lost in action during World War II were the destroyer escort
Rich
, the
U.S. Coast Guard
Cutter
Escanaba
, and the patrol craft
PC-1129
.
Submarine chaser
PC 482 was sunk by a
U-boat
in 1945. Defoe Shipbuilding Company also built three
Refrigerated Freight Barges
: YFR-888, YFR-889 and YFR-890 in 1945, also called a
reefer
barge.

After World War II
[
edit
]
After World War II, this company built two large Great Lakes bulk carriers, and it did repair work on
Great Lakes
ships including several repowerings, and self-unloading conversions. In later years, several ships were built for the
U.S. Navy
, including two
Dealey
-class destroyer escorts
, four
Charles F. Adams
-class
guided missile destroyers
, and three
Garcia
-class destroyer escorts
(later re-classified as frigates) for the U.S. Navy, and three guided-missile
destroyers
for the
Royal Australian Navy
. Also built there were the research vessels
RV
Melville
and
RV
Knorr
. This last was the ship that found the wreck of
RMS
Titanic
.
Great Lakes Bulk Freighters
[
edit
]
In the early 1950s Defoe Shipbuilding constructed two large
Great Lakes freighters
.  They were both roughly based on
U.S. Steel
's Pittsburgh Steamship Company AA Class ship design and shared similar dimensions.  As of April 2009, one of the two vessels is still in service on the Great Lakes.
The only remaining large Great Lakes bulk freight vessel built by Defoe Shipbuilding still in service is the 642' 03" long,
M/V
Ojibway
(Defoe hull #00422) operated by the Canadian firm Lower Lakes Towing, of Port Dover,
Ontario
, Canada.  The
Ojibway
was originally built as the steamer
Charles L. Hutchinson
(2) for the Pioneer Steamship Company of
Cleveland, Ohio
, and entered service on September 24, 1952.  In 1961, the Hutchinson was sold to
Ford Motor Company
of
Dearborn, Michigan
and was renamed
Ernest M. Breech
.  In 1988, Ford was in the process of eliminating its Great Lakes shipping fleet and sold the
Breech
to
George Steinbrenner
's Kinsman Marine of Cleveland, Ohio.  The Kinsman fleet in turn renamed the vessel
Kinsman Independent
(2).  She sailed with Kinsman until 2002 when her main unloading dock in
Buffalo, New York
, updated its unloading equipment, allowing it to be serviced by newer more common self-unloading vessels.  The vessel laid up in Buffalo for the last time under US flag on December 16, 2002.  In the spring of 2004, McKeil Marine of
Hamilton, Ontario
, Canada purchased the
Kinsman Independent
.  The ship was refurbished and repowered with a
diesel engine
,  then sold to
Voyageur Marine Transport LTD.
, of
Ridgeville, Ontario
, who returned her to service in late 2005 under the name
Voyageur Independent
.  Her current owner (Lower Lakes Towing) has operated the vessel since August 28, 2007, and renamed her
Ojibway
on February 29, 2008.
The second
Great Lakes freighter
built by Defoe was the 644' long
S/S
Richard M. Marshall
(Defoe hull #00424) which was constructed in 1953 for the Great Lakes Steamship Company, of Cleveland, Ohio.  She was a near twin to her predecessor (
Charles L. Hutchinson
) in size and capacity both having approximate dimensions of 640' long, 67' wide, 35' deep, and a cargo capacity of approximately 18,500 tons.  In December, 1956, Great Lakes Steamship started the process of selling off their fleet, and the
Marshall
was sold to The
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company
.  Starting with the 1957 season, Northwestern Mutual chartered the ship to the Wilson Marine Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio, who in turn renamed the vessel
Joseph S. Wood
.  In 1966, the charter agreement between Wilson and Northwestern Mutual was canceled, and the vessel was sold to the
Ford Motor Company
of Dearborn, Michigan, for $4.3 million (US).  Ford renamed the ship
John Dykstra
and she resumed trading on the Great Lakes on May 11, 1966.  In 1983, Ford renamed the ship
Benson Ford
(2) after the retirement of the original S/S
Benson Ford
.  In 1985, the vessel was renamed
US.265808
(the name Benson Ford being passed on to a third vessel), and was withdrawn from service.  The final voyage began when she cleared
Quebec City
,
Quebec
, Canada in tow of the Polish tug
Jantar
on August 11, 1987, along with the former
US Steel
freighter
T. W. Robinson
bound for
Recife, Brazil
, for dismantling.

The yard closed on 31 December 1976 after the Navy contracts expired.  Along with its dwindling navy contracts in its final years, the yard was contracted for three larger Great Lakes Freighter projects.  The first project was construction of the 68'x 104'7"x 46'6" bow section to the 1000' long integrated tug and barge
Presque Isle
.  The bow was launched July 27, 1972 and was towed to Erie by the tugs Maryland and Laurence C. Turner arriving October 6, 1972. There it was combined with the remainder of the barge which was under construction at Erie, PA.  The combined tug and barge unit were the second 1000' vessel trading on the lakes.  The second was the conversion of 690' S/S
Herbert C. Jackson
from a conventional style
Great Lakes freighter
to a self unloader.  The final major project was the conversion of the 620' lake freighter
Richard J. Reiss
from steam to diesel power.  All three vessels are still activity trading on the
Great Lakes
, the latter sailing now as the M/V
Manistee
.  The site of the shipyard later became the location for H. H. Hirschfield & Sons scrap yard.  Hirschfield was recently bought by OmniSource, Inc., another scrap company.

To earn "consensus" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.

Allen Jones
, gained widespread attention as a '
whistleblower
' after discovering that state employees were receiving
kickbacks
from the
pharmaceutical
industry in Texas while working as an investigator in the
Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector General
(OIG). According to several sources he discovered similar issues in
Pennsylvania
as well, but when investigating the Department of Welfare he was told to back down, and that the pharmaceutical industry "write checks to both sides of the aisle." "

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the belief in a supreme being in monotheistic thought. For powerful supernatural beings considered divine or sacred, see
Deity
. For God in specific religions, see
Conceptions of God
. For other uses, see
God (disambiguation)
.
Principal object of faith in monotheism
Representation (for the purpose of art or worship) of God in (left to right from top)
Christianity
,
Islam
,
Hinduism
,
Sikhism
,
Judaism
, and the
Baháʼí Faith
In
monotheistic
thought,
God
is usually viewed as the supreme being,
creator
, and principal object of
faith
.
[1]
In
polytheistic
thought,
a god
is "a spirit or being believed to control some part of the
universe
or life and often worshipped for doing so, or something that represents this spirit or being".
[2]
[3]
Belief in the existence of at least one god is called
theism
.
[4]
[5]
Views
regarding God vary considerably. Many notable theologians and philosophers have developed arguments for and against the
existence of God
.
[6]
Atheism
rejects the belief in any
deity
.
Agnosticism
is the belief that the existence of God is unknown or
unknowable
. Some
theists
view knowledge concerning God as derived from faith. God is often conceived as the greatest entity in existence.
[1]
God is often believed to be the cause of all things and so is seen as the creator and
sustainer
and the ruler of the
universe
. God is often thought of as
incorporeal
and
independent
of the material creation
[1]
[7]
[8]
while
pantheism
holds God is the universe itself. God is sometimes seen as the
most benevolent
, while
deism
holds that God is not involved in humanity apart from creation.
Some traditions attach spiritual significance to the relationship with God and see God as the source of all
moral obligation
, with acts such as
worship
and
prayer
.
[1]
God is sometimes described without reference
to gender
, while others use terminology that is gender-specific. God is referred to by different
names
depending on the language and cultural tradition with titles also used to refer to different attributes.
Etymology and usage
Main article:
God
(word)
The
Mesha Stele
bears the earliest known reference (840 BCE) to the Israelite God Yahweh.
The earliest written form of the Germanic word
God
comes from the 6th-century
Christian
Codex Argenteus
. The English word itself is derived from the
Proto-Germanic
*ǥuđan. The reconstructed
Proto-Indo-European
form
*ǵhu-tó-m
was likely based on the root
*ǵhau(ə)-
, which meant either "to call" or "to invoke".
[9]
The Germanic words for
God
were originally
neuter
, but during the process of the
Christianization
of the
Germanic peoples
from their indigenous
Germanic paganism
, the words became a
masculine syntactic form
.
[10]
In the
English language
, capitalization is used when the word is used as a
proper noun
, as well as for other names by which a god is known.
[11]
Consequently, the capitalized form of
god
is not used for multiple gods or when used to refer to the generic idea of a
deity
.
[12]
[13]
The English word
God
and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and all conceptions and, in spite of significant differences between religions, the term remains an English translation common to all.
El
means
God
in Hebrew, but
in Judaism
and
in Christianity
, God is also given a personal name, the
tetragrammaton
YHWH, in origin possibly the name of an
Edomite
or
Midianite
deity,
Yahweh
.
[14]
In many English translations of the
Bible
, when the word
LORD
is in all capitals, it signifies that the word represents the tetragrammaton.
[15]
Jah
or Yah is an abbreviation of Jahweh/Yahweh, and often sees usage by Jews and Christians in the interjection "
Hallelujah
", meaning "Praise Jah", which is used to give God glory.
[16]
In
Judaism
some of the Hebrew titles of God are considered
holy names
.
Allāh
(
Arabic
:
الله
) is the
Arabic
term with no
plural
used by Muslims and Arabic speaking Christians and Jews meaning "The God", while
ʾilāh
(
Arabic
:
إِلَٰه
plural
`āliha
آلِهَة) is the term used for a deity or a god in general.
[17]
[18]
[19]
Muslims
also use a
multitude of other titles
for God.
In
Hinduism
,
Brahman
is often considered a
monistic
concept of God.
[20]
God may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of Hinduism which emphasize the
personal nature of God
, with early references to his name as
Krishna
-
Vasudeva
in
Bhagavata
or later
Vishnu
and
Hari
.
[21]
Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa
is the term used in
Balinese Hinduism
.
[22]
In
Chinese religion
,
Shangdi
is conceived as the
progenitor
(first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly bringing
order
to it.
Ahura Mazda
is the name for God used in
Zoroastrianism
. "Mazda", or rather the Avestan stem-form
Mazdā-
, nominative
Mazdå
, reflects Proto-Iranian
*Mazdāh (female)
. It is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit, and like its
Sanskrit
cognate
medhā
, means "intelligence" or "wisdom". Both the Avestan and Sanskrit words reflect
Proto-Indo-Iranian
*mazdhā-
, from
Proto-Indo-European
mn̩sdʰeh
1
, literally meaning "placing (
dʰeh
1
) one's mind (
*mn̩-s
)", hence "wise".
[23]
Meanwhile
101 other names
are also in use.
[24]
Waheguru
(
Punjabi
:
vāhigurū
) is a term most often used in
Sikhism
to refer to God.
[25]
It means "Wonderful Teacher" in the Punjabi language.
Vāhi
(a
Middle Persian
borrowing) means "wonderful" and
guru
(
Sanskrit
:
guru
) is a term denoting "teacher". Waheguru is also described by some as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions. The most common usage of the word "Waheguru" is in the greeting Sikhs use with each other -
Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh
"Wonderful Lord's
Khalsa
, Victory is to the Wonderful Lord."
Baha
, the "greatest" name for God in the
Baháʼí Faith
, is Arabic for "All-Glorious".
[26]
Other names for God include
Aten
[27]
in ancient Egyptian
Atenism
where Aten was proclaimed to be the one "true" supreme being and creator of the universe,
[28]
Chukwu
in
Igbo
,
[29]
and
Hayyi Rabbi
in
Mandaeism
.
[30]
[31]
General conceptions
Existence
Main article:
Existence of God
See also:
Theism
,
Atheism
, and
Agnosticism
Thomas Aquinas
summed up
five main arguments
as proofs for God's existence (painting by
Carlo Crivelli
, 1476).
Isaac Newton
saw the existence of a Creator necessary in the movement of astronomical objects (painting by
Godfrey Kneller
, 1689).
Atheism
is, in a broad sense, the rejection of
belief
in the existence of
deities
.
[32]
[33]
Agnosticism
is the view that the
truth values
of certain claims—especially
metaphysical
and religious claims such as
whether God
, the
divine
or the
supernatural
exist—are unknown and perhaps unknowable.
[34]
[35]
[36]
[37]
Theism
generally holds that God exists objectively and independently of human thought and is sometimes used to refer to any belief in God or gods.
[38]
[39]
Some view the existence of God as an empirical question.
Richard Dawkins
states that "a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without, and it would be a scientific difference."
[40]
Carl Sagan
argued that the doctrine of a Creator of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could disprove the existence of a Creator (not necessarily a God) would be the discovery that the universe is infinitely old.
[41]
Some theologians, such as
Alister McGrath
, argue that the existence of God is not a question that can be answered using the
scientific method
.
[42]
[43]
Agnostic
Stephen Jay Gould
argued that science and religion are not in conflict and proposed an approach dividing the world of philosophy into what he called "
non-overlapping magisteria
" (NOMA).
[44]
In this view, questions of the
supernatural
, such as those relating to the
existence
and
nature
of God, are
non
-
empirical
and are the proper domain of
theology
. The methods of science should then be used to answer any empirical question about the natural world, and theology should be used to answer questions about ultimate meaning and moral value. In this view, the perceived lack of any empirical footprint from the magisterium of the supernatural onto natural events makes science the sole player in the natural world.
[45]
Stephen Hawking
and co-author
Leonard Mlodinow
state in their 2010 book,
The Grand Design
, that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.
[46]
[47]
Ontological arguments
refer to any argument for the existence of God that is based on a priori reasoning.
[48]
Notable ontological arguments were formulated by
Anselm
and
René Descartes
.
[49]
Cosmological arguments
, such as those described
below
, utilizes concepts around the origin of the universe to argue for the existence of God.
The
Teleological argument
, also called the ‘’argument from design’’, utilizes the complexity within the universe as a proof of the existence of God.
[50]
It is countered that the
fine tuning
required for a stable universe with life on earth is illusionary as humans are only able to observe the small part of this universe that succeeded in making such observation possible, called the
anthropic principle
, and so would not learn of, for example, life on other planets or of
universes
that did not occur because of different
laws of physics
.
[51]
Non-theists have argued that complex processes that have natural explanations yet to be discovered are referred to the supernatural, called
god of the gaps
. Other theists, such as
John Henry Newman
who believed
theistic evolution
was acceptable, have also argued against versions of the teleological argument and held that it is limiting of God to view him having to only intervene specially in some instances rather than having complex processes designed to create order.
[52]
The
Argument from beauty
states that this universe happens to contain special beauty in it and that there would be no particular reason for this over aesthetically neutrality other than God.
[53]
This has been countered by pointing to the existence of ugliness in the universe.
[54]
This has also been countered by arguing that beauty has no objective reality and so the Universe could be seen as ugly or that humans have made what is more beautiful than nature.
[55]
The
Argument from morality
argues for the existence of God given the assumption of the objective existence of
morals
.
[56]
While prominent non-theistic philosophers such as the atheist
J. L. Mackie
agreed that the argument is valid, they disagreed with its premises.
David Hume
argued that there is no basis to believe in objective moral truths while biologist
E. O. Wilson
theorized that the feelings of morality is a by product of natural selection in humans and would not exist independent of the mind.
[57]
Philosopher
Michael Lou Martin
argued that a subjective account for morality can be acceptable. Similar to the argument from morality is the
argument from conscience
which argues for the existence of God given the existence of a conscience that informs of right and wrong, even against prevailing moral codes. Philosopher
John Locke
instead argued that conscience is a social construct and thus could lead to contradicting morals.
[58]
Oneness
Main articles:
Deity
,
Monotheism
, and
Henotheism
Trinitarians believe that God is composed of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
A
deity
, or "god" (with
lowercase
g
), refers to a supernatural being.
[59]
Monotheism
is the belief that there is only one deity, referred to as ‘’God’’ (with uppercase
g
). Comparing or equating other entities to God is viewed as
idolatry
in monotheism, and is often strongly condemned.
Judaism
includes some of the oldest monotheistic traditions in the world.
[60]
Islam's most fundamental concept is
tawhid
meaning "oneness" or "uniqueness".
[61]
The first
pillar of Islam
is an
oath
that forms the basis of the religion and which non-Muslims wishing to convert must recite, declares that "I testify that there is no
deity
except God."
[62]
In Christianity, the
doctrine of the Trinity
describes God as one God in
Father
,
Son
(
Jesus
), and
Holy Spirit
.
[63]
In the past centuries, this fundamental mystery of the Christian faith was also summarized by the Latin formula
Sancta Trinitas, Unus Deus
(Holy Trinity, Unique God), reported in the
Litanias Lauretanas
.
God in Hinduism
is viewed differently by diverse strands of the religion with most Hindus having faith in a
supreme reality
(
Brahman
) who can be manifested in numerous chosen deities. Thus, the religion is sometimes characterized as
Polymorphic Monotheism
.
[64]
Henotheism
is the belief and worship of a single god at a time while accepting the validity of worshiping other deities.
[65]
Monolatry
is the belief in only a single deity worthy of worship while accepting the existence of other dieties.
[66]
Transcendence
See also:
Pantheism
and
Panentheism
Transcendence
is the aspect of God's nature that is completely independent of the material universe and its physical laws. Many supposed characteristics of God are described in human terms.
Anselm
thought that God did not feel emotions such as anger or love, but appeared to do so through our imperfect understanding. The incongruity of judging "being" against something that might not exist, led many medieval philosophers approach to knowledge of God through negative attributes, called
Negative theology
. For example, one should not say that God is wise, but can say that God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). Christian theologian
Alister McGrath
writes that one has to understand a "personal god" as an analogy. "To say that God is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe."
[67]
Pantheism
holds that God is the universe and the universe is God and denies that God transcends the Universe.
[68]
For famed pantheist philosopher
Baruch Spinoza
, the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance, God, or its equivalent, Nature.
[69]
[70]
Pantheism is sometimes objected to as not providing any meaningful explanation of God with the German philosopher
Schopenhauer
stating “Pantheism is only a euphemism for atheism”.
[71]
Pandeism
holds that God was a separate entity but then
became the Universe
.
[72]
[73]
Panentheism
holds that God contains, but is not identical to, the Universe.
[74]
[75]
Creator

God Blessing the Seventh Day
, 1805 watercolor painting by
William Blake
God is often viewed as the cause of all that exists. For
Pythagoreans
,
Monad
variously referred to divinity, the first being or an indivisible origin.
[76]
The philosophy of
Plato
and
Plotinus
refers to “
The One
” which is the first principle of reality that is ‘’beyond’’ being
[77]
and is both the source of the Universe and the
teleological
purpose of all things.
[78]
Aristotle
theorized a
first uncaused cause
for all motion in the universe and viewed it as perfectly beautiful, immaterial, unchanging and indivisible.
Aseity
is the property of not depending on any cause other than itself for its existence.
Avicenna
held that there must be a
necessarily existent
guaranteed to exist by its essence - it cannot ‘’not’’ exist - and that humans identify this as God.
[79]
Secondary causation
refers to God creating the laws of the Universe which then can change themselves within the
framework of those laws
. In addition to the initial creation,
occasionalism
refers to the idea that the Universe would not by default continue to exist from one instant to the next and so would need to rely on God as a
sustainer
. While
divine providence
refers to any intervention by God it is usually used to refer to "special providence" where there is an extraordinary intervention by God, such as
miracles
.
[80]
[81]
Benevolence
See also:
Deism
and
Thirteen Attributes of Mercy
Deism holds that God exists but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it,
[82]
such as answering prayers or producing miracles. Deists sometimes attribute this to God having no interest in or not being aware of humanity. Pandeists would hold that God does not intervene because God is the Universe.
[83]
Of those theists who hold that God has an interest in humanity, most hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent. This belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world.
Dystheism
, which is related to
theodicy
, is a form of theism which holds that God is either not wholly good or is fully malevolent as a consequence of the
problem of evil
.
Omniscience and omnipotence
Omnipotence
(all-powerful) is an attribute often ascribed to God. The
omnipotence paradox
is most often framed with the example "Could God create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it?" as God could either be unable to create that stone or lift that stone and so could not be omnipotent. This is often countered with variations of the argument that omnipotence, like any other attribute ascribed to God, only applies as far as it is noble enough to befit God and thus God cannot lie, or do what is contradictory as that would entail opposing himself.
[84]
Omniscience (all-knowing) is an attribute often ascribed to God. This implies that God knows how free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, either their
free will
might be illusory or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.
[85]
Open Theism
limits God’s omniscience by contending that, due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future and
process theology
holds that God does not have
immutability
, so is affected by his creation.
Other concepts
Classical theists (such as ancient Greco-Medieval philosophers,
Roman Catholics
,
Eastern Orthodox Christians
, many
Jews
and
Muslims
, and some
Protestants
)
[a]
speak of God as a
divinely simple
'
nothing
' that is completely
transcendent
(totally independent of all else), and having attributes such as
immutability
,
impassibility
, and timelessness.
[87]
Theologians
of theistic personalism (the view held by
Rene Descartes
,
Isaac Newton
,
Alvin Plantinga
,
Richard Swinburne
,
William Lane Craig
, and most
modern evangelicals
) argue that God is most generally the ground of all being, immanent in and transcendent over the whole world of reality, with immanence and transcendence being the contrapletes of personality.
[88]
God has also been conceived as being
incorporeal
(immaterial), a
personal
being, the source of all
moral obligation
, and the "greatest conceivable existent".
[1]
These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers, including
Maimonides
,
[86]
Augustine of Hippo
,
[86]
and
Al-Ghazali
,
[6]
respectively.
Non-theistic views
Religious traditions
Jainism
has
generally rejected creationism
, holding that soul substances (
Jīva
) are uncreated and that time is beginningless.
[89]
Some interpretations and traditions of
Buddhism
can be conceived as being
non-theistic
.
Buddhism has generally rejected
the specific monotheistic view of a
Creator God
. The Buddha criticizes the theory of creationism in the
early Buddhist texts
.
[90]
[91]
Also, major Indian Buddhist philosophers, such as
Nagarjuna
,
Vasubandhu
,
Dharmakirti
and
Buddhaghosa
, consistently critiqued Creator God views put forth by Hindu thinkers.
[92]
[93]
[94]
However, as a non-theistic religion, Buddhism leaves the existence of a supreme deity ambiguous. There are significant numbers of Buddhists who believe in God, and there are equally large numbers who deny God's existence or are unsure.
[95]
[96]
Taoic religions such as
Confucianism
and
Taoism
are silent on the existence of creator gods. However, keeping with the tradition of
ancestor veneration in China
, adherents worship the spirits of people such as
Confucius
and
Lao Tzu
in a similar manner to God.
[97]

Anthropology

Evolutionary origin of religions
,
Evolutionary psychology of religion
, and
Anthropomorphism
Some atheists have argued that a single, omniscient God who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly attentive to the lives of humans has been imagined and embellished over generations.
[99]
Pascal Boyer
argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world, in general, supernatural beings tend to behave much like people. The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion. He cites examples from
Greek mythology
, which is, in his opinion, more like a modern
soap opera
than other religious systems.
[100]
Bertrand du Castel
and Timothy Jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that Boyer's explanatory model matches physics'
epistemology
in positing not directly observable entities as intermediaries.
[101]
Anthropologist
Stewart Guthrie contends that people project human features onto non-human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar.
Sigmund Freud
also suggested that god concepts are projections of one's father.
[102]
Likewise,
Émile Durkheim
was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings. In line with this reasoning, psychologist Matt Rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups, they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality. In small groups, morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation. However, it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups. Rossano indicates that by including ever-watchful gods and spirits, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.

Johns Hopkins researchers studying the effects of the “spirit molecule”
DMT
, which is both an endogenous molecule in the human brain and the active molecule in the
psychedelic
ayahuasca
, found that a large majority of respondents said DMT brought them into contact with a "conscious, intelligent, benevolent, and sacred entity," and describe interactions that oozed joy, trust, love, and kindness. More than half of those who had previously self-identified as atheists described some type of belief in a higher power or God after the experience.
[105]
About a quarter of those afflicted by
temporal lobe seizures
experience what is described as a religious experience
[106]
and may become preoccupied by thoughts of God even if they were not previously. Neuroscientist
V. S. Ramachandran
hypothesizes that seizures in the temporal lobe, which is closely connected to the emotional center of the brain, the
limbic system
, may lead to those afflicted to view even banal objects with heightened meaning.
[107]
Psychologists studying feelings of
awe
found that participants feeling awe after watching scenes of natural wonders become more likely to believe in a supernatural being and to see events as the result of design, even when given randomly generated numbers.

Worship
See also:
Worship
,
Prayer
, and
Supplication
Theistic religious traditions often require
worship
of God and sometimes hold that the
purpose of existence
is to
worship
God.
[109]
[110]
To address the issue of an all-powerful being demanding to be worshipped, it is held that God does not need or benefit from worship but that worship is for the benefit of the worshipper.
[111]
Gandhi
expressed the view that God does not need his supplication and that "Prayer is not an asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is a daily admission of one's weakness".
[112]
Invoking God in
prayer
plays a significant role among many believers. Depending on the tradition, God can be viewed as a personal God who is only to be invoked directly while other traditions allow praying to intermediaries, such as
saints
, to
intercede
on their behalf. Prayer often also includes
supplication
such as
asking forgiveness
. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a
hadith
states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance.
[113]
Sacrifice
for the sake of God is another act of devotion that includes
fasting
and
almsgiving
.
Remembrance
of God in daily life include mentioning interjections
thanking God
when feeling gratitude or
phrases of adoration
such as repeating
chants
while performing other activities.
Salvation
Main article:
Salvation
Transtheistic
religious traditions may believe in the existence of deities but deny any spiritual significance to them. The term has been used to describe certain strands of Buddhism,
[114]
Jainism and
Stoicism
.
[115]
Among religions that do attach spirituality to the relationship with God disagree as how to best
worship
God and what is
God's plan
for mankind. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the
chosen people
or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through
revelation
or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is
religious pluralism
. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. The view that all theists actually worship the same god, whether they know it or not, is especially emphasized in the Baháʼí Faith, Hinduism
[116]
and Sikhism.
[117]
The
Baháʼí Faith
preaches that
divine manifestations
include great prophets and teachers of many of the major religious traditions such as Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, Zoroaster, Muhammad, Bahá'ú'lláh and also preaches the unity of all religions and focuses on these multiple epiphanies as necessary for meeting the needs of humanity at different points in history and for different cultures, and as part of a scheme of
progressive revelation
and education of humanity. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is
supersessionism
, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is
relativistic inclusivism
, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being
universalism
: the doctrine that
salvation
is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is
syncretism
, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the
New Age
movement.
Epistemology
Faith
Main article:
Faith
Fideism
is the position that in certain topics, notably theology such as in
reformed epistemology
, faith is superior than reason in arriving at truths. Some theists argue that there is value to the risk in having faith and that if the arguments for God’s existence were as rational as the laws of physics then there would be no risk. Such theists often argue that the heart is attracted to beauty, truth and goodness and so would be best for dictating about God, as illustrated through
Blaise Pascal
who said, “The heart has its reasons that reason does not know.”
[118]
A hadith attributes a quote to God as “I am what my slave thinks of me”.
[119]
Inherent intuition about God is referred to in Islam as
fitra
,
or “innate nature”.
[120]
In
Confucian
tradition,
Confucius
and
Mencius
promoted that the only justification for right conduct, called the Way, is what is dictated by Heaven, a more or less anthropomorphic higher power, and is implanted in humans and thus there is only one universal foundation for the Way.
[121]
Revelation
Main article:
Revelation
See also:
Prophet
Revelation refers to some form of message communicated by God. This is usually proposed to occur through the use of
prophets
or
angels
.
Al-Maturidi
argued for the need for revelation because even though humans are intellectually capable of realizing God, human desire can divert the intellect and because
certain knowledge
cannot be known except for been specially given to prophets, such as the specifications of acts of worship.
[122]
It is argued that there is also that which overlaps between what is revealed and what can be derived. According to Islam, one of the earliest revelations to ever be revealed was “If you feel no shame, then do as you wish.”
[123]
The term
General revelation
is used to refer to knowledge revealed about God outside of
direct
or
special
revelation such as scriptures. Notably, this includes studying nature, sometimes seen as the
Book of Nature
.
[124]
An idiom in Arabic states, "The Qur’an is a Universe that speaks. The Universe is a silent Qur’an".
[125]
Reason
On matters of theology, some such as
Richard Swinburne
, take an
evidentialist
position, where a belief is only justified if it has a reason behind it, as opposed to holding it as a
foundational belief
.
[126]
Traditionalist theology
holds that one should not opinionate beyond revelation to understand God's nature and frown upon rationalizations such as
speculative theology
.
[127]
Notably, for
anthropomorphic descriptions
such as the “Hand of God” and
attributes of God
, they neither nullify such texts nor accept a literal hand but leave any ambiguity to God, called
tafwid
, without
asking how
.
[128]

In the
Judeo-Christian
tradition, "the Bible has been the principal source of the conceptions of God". That the Bible "includes many different images, concepts, and ways of thinking about" God has resulted in perpetual "disagreements about how God is to be conceived and understood".
[131]
Throughout the Hebrew and Christian Bibles there are titles for God, who revealed his personal name as
YHWH
(often vocalized as
Yahweh
or
Jehovah
).
[14]
One of them is
Elohim
. Another one is
El Shaddai
, translated "God Almighty".
[132]
A third notable title is
El Elyon
, which means "The High God".
[133]
Also noted in the
Hebrew
and
Christian
Bibles is the name "
I Am that I Am
".
[134]
[14]
God is described and referred in the
Quran

names or attributes
, the most common being
Al-Rahman
, meaning "Most Compassionate" and
Al-Rahim
, meaning "Most Merciful".

Gender
Main article:
Gender of God
The gender of God may be viewed as either a literal or an
allegorical
aspect of a
deity
who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form.
[136]
[137]
Polytheistic
religions commonly attribute to each of
the gods
a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most
monotheistic
religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the
gender
of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an
analogical
statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.
[138]
Biblical sources usually refer to God using male or paternal words and symbolism, except
Genesis 1:26-27
,
[139]
[140]

In Zoroastrianism, during the early
Parthian Empire
,
Ahura Mazda
was visually represented for worship. This practice ended during the beginning of the
Sasanian Empire
. Zoroastrian
iconoclasm
, which can be traced to the end of the Parthian period and the beginning of the Sassanid, eventually put an end to the use of all images of Ahura Mazda in worship. However, Ahura Mazda continued to be symbolized by a dignified male figure, standing or on horseback, which is found in Sassanian investiture.
[141]
Deities from
Near Eastern cultures
are often thought of as
anthropomorphic
entities who have a human like body which is, however, not equal to a human body. Such bodies were often thought to be radiant or fiery, of superhuman size or extreme beauty. The ancient deity of the
Israelites
(
Yahweh
) too was imagined as a transcendent but still anthropomorphic deity.
[142]
Humans could not see him, because of their impurity in contrast to Yahweh's holiness, Yahweh being described as radiating fire and light which could kill a human if looking at him. Further, more religious or spiritual people tend to have less anthropomorphic depictions of God.
[143]
In Judaism, the
Torah
often ascribes human features to God, however, many other passages describe God as formless and otherworldly. Judaism is
aniconic
, meaning it overly lacks material, physical representations of both the natural and supernatural worlds. Furthermore, the worship of idols is strictly forbidden. The traditional view, elaborated by figures such as
Maimonides
, reckons that God is wholly incomprehensible and therefore impossible to envision, resulting in a historical tradition of "divine incorporeality". As such, attempting to describe God's "appearance" in practical terms is considered disrespectful to the deity and thus is deeply taboo, and arguably heretical.

Gnostic
cosmogony often depicts the creator god of the Old Testament as an evil lesser deity or
Demiurge
, while the higher benevolent god or
Monad
is thought of as something beyond comprehension having immeasurable light and not in time or among things that exist, but rather is greater than them in a sense. All people are said to have a piece of God or
divine spark
within them which has fallen from the immaterial world into the corrupt material world and is trapped unless
gnosis
is attained.

Use of the symbolic
Hand of God
in the
Ascension
from the
Drogo Sacramentary
, c. 850
Early Christians believed that the words of the
Gospel of John
1:18: "No man has seen God at any time" and numerous other statements were meant to apply not only to God, but to all attempts at the depiction of God.
[147]
However, later depictions of God are found. Some, like the
Hand of God
, are depiction borrowed from Jewish art. Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to use a human to symbolize
God the Father
in
Western art
.
[147]
Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of man in the image of his own (thus allowing human to transcend the other animals). It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a usage of the whole human figure. Typically only a small part would be used as the image, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely a whole human. In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.
[148]
By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French
illuminated manuscripts
, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in
stained glass
church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the
Baptism of Christ
on the famous
baptismal font in Liège
of
Rainer of Huy
is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene). Gradually the amount of the human symbol shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in
Giotto
's
fresco
of c. 1305 in
Padua
.
[149]
In the 14th century the
Naples Bible
carried a depiction of God the Father in the
Burning bush
. By the early 15th century, the
Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry
has a considerable number of symbols, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the
Garden of Eden
, which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress. The
"Gates of Paradise" of the Florence Baptistry
by
Lorenzo Ghiberti
, begun in 1425 use a similar tall full-length symbol for the Father. The
Rohan Book of Hours
of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer. At the same period other works, like the large Genesis
altarpiece
by the Hamburg painter
Meister Bertram
, continued to use the old depiction of Christ as
Logos
in Genesis scenes. In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as
similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ
. In a Trinitarian
Pietà
, God the Father is often symbolized using a man wearing a papal dress and a papal crown, supporting the dead Christ in his arms.
[150]
In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the
Great Moscow Council
specifically included a ban on a number of symbolic depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,
[151]
[152]
mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the "Ancient of Days" was Christ, as
Logos
, not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as
Greece
,
Romania
, and other Orthodox countries.

In Islam, Muslims believe that God (
Allah
) is beyond all comprehension, and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Muslims tend to use the least anthropomorphism among monotheists.

They are not
iconodules
and have religious calligraphy of titles of God instead of pictures.

The
1976-77
Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey
team
represented the
University of Wisconsin-Madison
in
college ice hockey
. In its tenth year under head coach
Bob Johnson
, the team compiled a 37-7-1 record (26-5-1 against
Western Collegiate Hockey Association
(WCHA) opponents) and outscored all opponents 264 to 161.
[1]
The Badgers received the WCHA's automatic bid to the
1977 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament
by winning the
1977 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament
, the only singular
WCHA tournament champion
over a 16-year period (1965 to 1981). They defeated the
New Hampshire Wildcats
in the Frozen Four semifinals and then beat WCHA- and Big Ten-rival
Michigan Wolverines
by a 6-5 score in overtime to win the national championship in
Detroit
,
Michigan
.
Goalie
Julian Baretta
was chosen as the
Most Outstanding Player
in the NCAA Tournament. He had two shutouts and a .905 save percentage for the season. The team's leading scorer was junior
defenseman
Craig Norwich
with 18 goals, 65 assists, and 83 points. Norwich was the third defenseman (
Bob Heathcott
,
1952
;
Dan Lodboa
,
1970
) in NCAA history to lead his team in scoring while winning a National Title in the same season (the next occurrence was
2018
).
Season
[
edit
]
Head coach
Bob Johnson
returned to the program after taking a year off to coach the
Team USA
at the
1976 Winter Olympics
in
Innsbruck
. The Olympic team finished a disappointing 5th-place after taking Silver in
1972
but the Badgers had fared even worse in Johnson's absence. Wisconsin went 12-24-1 under interim coach
Bill Rothwell
, compiling their first losing season since returning to varsity status in
1963
(The Badgers would not have another losing season until
1995-96
).
[2]
Seeking to erase the previous year from their collective memories, the Badgers opened with a 6-7 overtime loss to dual conference rival
Michigan
but evened their record with an overtime win the following day. Over the next six games, Wisconsin scored no less than 5 times, winning each match until
Michigan State
handed them their second defeat of the season. After trading wins with several teams, and losing a match to
HC Spartak Moscow
, Wisconsin won 12 games in a row after the new year, rocketing up the standings to take first place in the WCHA. Wisconsin finished the regular season winning 26 of their 32 WCHA games to capture their first conference title and were led by
Craig Norwich
in scoring. Norwich's 63 points in WCHA play was good for third best across the conference and paced all defensemen by a wide margin.
Prior to the season, the NCAA instituted a new policy where they gave their tournament selection committee the ability to add up to four additional teams to the tournament.
[3]
In response to this the WCHA changed their tournament format to have a solitary champion that would receive an automatic tournament bid rather than two co-champions who would both proceed to the national championship. This format would be in place for only the 1977 season and would revert to a co-champion system in
1978
.
[4]
Because of this Wisconsin would have to face three rounds of competitors rather than the customary two to win the WCHA tournament.
The Badgers played 8th-place
Colorado College
in the quarterfinals, who made the tournament over
Michigan State
based on tie-breakers. Though the Tigers had lost all four games to Wisconsin in the regular season they had done so with only seven fewer goals than the Badgers. In the two-game series Colorado College held Wisconsin's high-powered offense to only three goals twice, far below their average, but could only manage one score in each contest. In the semifinals the Badgers faced off against an upstart
Minnesota
squad that had defeated #2 seed
Notre Dame
in the opening round. The Golden Gophers were no match for the Badgers who took the series 17-8 and were set against
Michigan
in the championship series. Wisconsin got off to a great start, taking the first game 4-0, before cruising to a WCHA championship with a 5-4 win in the following game to take the series 9-4. The title gave Wisconsin an automatic bid to the
1977 NCAA tournament
as the #1 western seed.
In their first game at the
Olympia Stadium
Wisconsin played
New Hampshire
, who possessed the #1 offense in the east. The two teams fought to a 3-3 tie after regulation but
Julian Baretta
kept everything out of the Badger's net in the extra frame and allowed
Mike Eaves
to score the game-winner.
[5]
The championship match set Johnson's Badgers against
Farrell's
Wolverines for the seventh time that season. Wisconsin's offensive firepower was apparent from the start and the Badgers jumped out to a 3-0 lead on the strength of two power play goals. Michigan replied with two man-advantage markers of their own to cut the score to 3-2 but goals by
Mike Meeker
and
Mark Johnson
at the beginnings of the second and third periods rebuilt the Badger's 3-goal lead. The Wolverines, however, would not go away and Mark Miller scored 26 seconds after Johnson's second goal of the game.
Dave Debol
notched his second less than a minute later to cut Wisconsin's lead to 1 goal and it was completely erased with less than 6 minutes in regulation by  John Wayman. With the score tied and the Badger's reeling Baretta kept the score tied 5-5 and allowed Wisconsin to regain their footing as the two teams headed into overtime. In what turned out to be the shortest overtime period in NCAA championship history,
Steve Alley
backhanded the puck past Michigan netminder Rick Palmer and sent the Badger faithful into paroxysms of joy.
[6]
[7]
Wisconsin won its second
National Title
in 5 years on the strength of its power play, scoring a then-record 93 goals on the man-advantage over the course of the season. Only the 1980
Minnesota
team has scored more (99).
[8]
Mark Johnson
set an NCAA record for freshman in assists (44) and points (80) and was named WCHA
Freshman of the Year
.
Bob Johnson
was named as the WCHA
Coach of the Year
while
Julian Baretta
and
Craig Norwich
earned both
First Team
All-
WCHA
and
AHCA
All-American
honors.
Mike Eaves
was selected for the WCHA
Second Team
and an All-American while
John Taft
received a spot on the WCHA Second Team.

Round table with
Barack Obama
in
Minneapolis
Round table
is a form of academic discussion. Participants agree on a specific topic to discuss and debate. Each person is given equal right to participate, as illustrated by the idea of a circular layout referred to in the term
round table
.
Round-table discussions, together with houses of hospitality and agronomic universities, is one of the key elements of the
Catholic Worker Movement
, as formulated by
Peter Maurin
, one of the co-founders of the movement.
[1]
Round table discussions are also a common feature of political talk shows.  Talk shows such as
Washington Week
and
Meet the Press
have roundtables of reporters or pundits.  Most of these are done around a table in a studio, but occasionally they report in split-screen from remote locations.  Some sports shows, such as
ESPN
's
Around the Horn
, employ a virtual
augmented reality
round table format. The round table method is still highly used to this day.

Bishop of Härnösand
, built in 1814; after the death of Bishop
Frans Michael Franzén
in Säbrå in 1847 the building functioned as the summer residence of the bishop.

Titus Canyon rock formations.
Titus Canyon Road, with view of
Death Valley
.
Titus Canyon
is a deep, narrow gorge cut into the steep face of the
Grapevine Mountains
of the
Mojave Desert
, within
Death Valley National Park
in southeastern
California
and southwestern
Nevada
. The
canyon
features
limestone
rock formations,
petroglyphs
, and
native plants
and wildlife.
[1]
[2]
Geology
[
edit
]
Although the Grapevine Mountains were
uplifted
relatively recently, most of the rocks that make up the range are over half a billion years old. The gray rocks lining the walls of the western end of Titus Canyon are
Cambrian
age (570-505 million years old) limestone. These ancient
Paleozoic
rocks formed at a time when the Death Valley area was submerged beneath tropical seas. By the end of the
Precambrian
, the continental edge of
North America
had been planed off by
erosion
to a gently rounded surface of low relief. The rise and fall of the Cambrian seas periodically shifted the shoreline eastward, flooding the continent, then regressed westward, exposing the limestone layers to erosion.
[3]
The sediments have since been upturned, upfolded (forming
anticlines
), downfolded (forming
synclines
) and folded back onto themselves (forming
recumbent folds
).
Although some of the limestone exposed in the walls of Titus Canyon originated from thick mats of
algae
(
stromatolites
) that thrived in the warm, shallow Death Valley seas, most of the gray limestone shows little structure. Thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) of this limey goo were deposited in the Death Valley region. Similar limestone layers may be seen at
Lake Mead National Recreation Area
and at the bottom of the
Grand Canyon
.  At one of the bends in the canyon,
megabreccia
can be seen.

Access
[

Titus Canyon is located above the east side of
Death Valley
, within
Death Valley National Park
. Access by foot from the west via Death Valley, or by vehicles from the east via Nevada. The one-way rough dirt road access begins west of the town of
Beatty, Nevada
.  Vehicle travel is allowed only east to west through Titus Canyon, from the Daylight Pass Road−Nevada Highway 374 on the east, over a pass and down to the mouth of the canyon in Death Valley on the west.

Language for communicating instructions to a machine
A
programming language
is a system of notation for writing
computer programs
.
[1]
The
source code
for a simple computer program written in the
C programming language
. The gray lines are
comments
that help explain the program to humans in a
natural language
. When
compiled
and
run
, it will give the output "
Hello, world!
".
A programming language is usually described in terms of its
syntax
(form) and
semantics
(meaning). These are usually defined by a
formal language
.
[
citation needed
]
A language usually has at least one
implementation
in the form of a
compiler
or
interpreter
, allowing programs written in the language to be
executed
.
Programming language theory
is the subfield of
computer science
that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.
Definitions
[
edit
]
There are many considerations when defining what constitutes a programming language.
Computer languages vs programming languages
[
edit
]
The term
computer language
is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.
[2]
However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.
[3]
Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.
[4]
One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of expressing, as described by the
theory of computation
. The majority of practical programming languages are
Turing complete
,
[5]
and all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of
algorithms
.
ANSI/ISO SQL-92
and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages.
[6]
[7]
However, some authors restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.
[1]
[8]
Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming
abstract machines
and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.
[9]
John C. Reynolds
emphasizes that
formal specification
languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.
[10]
Domain and target
[
edit
]
In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.
[11]
Programming languages differ from
natural languages
in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
The domain of the language is also worth consideration.
Markup languages
like
XML
,
HTML
, or
troff
, which define
structured data
, are not usually considered programming languages.
[12]
[13]
[14]
Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined.
XSLT
, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax.
[15]
[16]
[17]
Moreover,
LaTeX
, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset.
[18]
[19]
Abstractions
[
edit
]
Programming languages usually contain
abstractions
for defining and manipulating
data structures
or controlling the
flow of execution
. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the
abstraction principle
.
[20]
This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.
[21]

History of programming language theory
Early developments
[
edit
]
Very early computers, such as
Colossus
, were programmed without the help of a
stored program
, by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.
Slightly later, programs could be written in
machine language
, where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory locations might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from
punched cards
, paper tape,
magnetic tape
or toggled in on switches on the
front panel
of the computer. Machine languages were later termed
first-generation programming languages
(1GL).
The next step was the development of the so-called
second-generation programming languages
(2GL) or
assembly languages
, which were still closely tied to the
instruction set architecture
of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.
The first
high-level programming languages
, or
third-generation programming languages
(3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was
Plankalkül
, developed for the German
Z3
by
Konrad Zuse
between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.
[22]
John Mauchly
's
Short Code
, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an
electronic computer
.
[23]
Unlike
machine code
, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in an understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.
At the
University of Manchester
,
Alick Glennie
developed
Autocode
in the early 1950s. As a
programming language
, it used a
compiler
to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the
Mark 1
computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first
compiled
high-level programming language.
[24]
[25]
The second auto code was developed for the Mark 1 by
R. A. Brooker
in 1954 and was called the "Mark 1 Autocode". Brooker also developed an auto code for the
Ferranti Mercury
in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the
EDSAC 2
was devised by
D. F. Hartley
of
University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory
in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimization and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development,
Atlas Autocode
was developed for the University of Manchester
Atlas 1
machine.
In 1954,
FORTRAN
was invented at IBM by
John Backus
. It was the first widely used
high-level general-purpose programming language
to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.
[26]
[27]
It is still a popular language for
high-performance computing
[28]
and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's
fastest supercomputers
.
[29]
Another early programming language was devised by
Grace Hopper
in the US, called
FLOW-MATIC
. It was developed for the
UNIVAC I
at
Remington Rand
during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with
mathematical notation
, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an
English
programming language and implemented a prototype.
[30]
The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.
[31]
FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of
COBOL
, since only it and its direct descendant
AIMACO
were in actual use at the time.
[32]
Refinement
[
edit
]
The increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for
low-level programming languages
or
system programming languages
. These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages. They can be used to perform tasks that require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking.
The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use:
APL
introduced
array programming
and influenced
functional programming
.
[33]
ALGOL
refined both
structured procedural programming
and the discipline of
language specification
; the "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language
ALGOL 60
" became a model for how later language specifications were written.
Lisp
, implemented in 1958, was the first dynamically-typed
functional programming
language.
In the 1960s,
Simula
was the first language designed to support
object-oriented programming
; in the mid-1970s,
Smalltalk
followed with the first "purely" object-oriented language.
C
was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language for the
Unix
operating system and remains popular.
[34]
Prolog
, designed in 1972, was the first
logic programming
language.
In 1978,
ML
built a polymorphic type system on top of
Lisp
, pioneering
statically-typed
functional programming
languages.
Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.
The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of
structured programming
, and whether programming languages should be designed to support it.
[35]
Edsger Dijkstra
, in a famous 1968 letter published in the
Communications of the ACM
, argued that
Goto
statements should be eliminated from all "higher-level" programming languages.
[36]
Consolidation and growth
[
edit
]
A small selection of programming language textbooks
The 1980s were years of relative consolidation.
C++
combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized
Ada
, a systems programming language derived from
Pascal
and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating the so-called
"fifth-generation" languages
that incorporated logic programming constructs.
[37]
The functional languages community moved to standardize
ML
and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.
One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of
modules
or large-scale organizational units of code.
Modula-2
, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to
generic programming
constructs.
[38]
The rapid growth of the
Internet
in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages.
Perl
, originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic
websites
.
Java
came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of "
Write once, run anywhere
" (
UCSD Pascal
had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).
Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and
reliability verification
, new kinds of modularity (
mixins
,
delegates
,
aspects
), and database integration such as Microsoft's
LINQ
.
Fourth-generation programming languages
(4GL) are computer programming languages that aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs.
Fifth-generation programming languages
(5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an
algorithm
written by a programmer.
Elements
[
edit
]
All programming languages have some
primitive
building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.
Syntax
[
edit
]
Main article:
Syntax (programming languages)
Parse tree
of
Python code
with inset tokenization
Syntax highlighting
is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is
Python
.
A programming language's surface form is known as its
syntax
. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, some programming languages are more
graphical
in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.
The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either
formal
or hard-coded in a
reference implementation
). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.
The programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of
regular expressions
(for
lexical
structure) and
Backus-Naur form
(for
grammatical
structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on
Lisp
:
expression
::=
atom | list
atom
::=
number | symbol
number
::=
[+-]?['0'-'9']+
symbol
::=
['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*
list
::=
'(' expression* ')'
This grammar specifies the following:
an
expression
is either an
atom
or a
list
;
an
atom
is either a
number
or a
symbol
;
a
number
is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;
a
symbol
is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and
a
list
is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more
expressions
inside it.
The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar:
12345
,
()
and
(a b c232 (1))
.
Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit
undefined behavior
. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.
Using
natural language
as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:
"
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously
." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.
"John is a married bachelor." is grammatically
well-formed
but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.
The following
C language
fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation
*p >> 4
has no meaning for a value having a complex type and
p->im
is not defined because the value of
p
is the
null pointer
):
complex
*
p
=
NULL
;
complex
abs_p
=
sqrt
(
*
p
>>
4
+
p
->
im
);
If the
type declaration
on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on the undefined variable
p
during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.
The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the
Chomsky hierarchy
. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are
context-free grammars
.
[39]
Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an
undecidable problem
, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution.
[40]
In contrast to
Lisp's macro system
and Perl's
BEGIN
blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.
[41]
Semantics
[
edit
]
The term
semantics
refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form (
syntax
).
Static semantics
[
edit
]
A static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms.
[1]
[
failed verification
]
For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every
identifier
is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a
case statement
are distinct.
[42]
Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that
subroutine
calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a
logic
called a
type system
. Other forms of
static analyses
like
data flow analysis
may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like
Java
and
C#
have
definite assignment analysis
, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.
Dynamic semantics
[
edit
]
Main article:
Semantics of programming languages
Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the
strategy
by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which
control structures
conditionally execute
statements
. The
dynamic semantics
(also known as
execution semantics
) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into
formal semantics of programming languages
, which allows execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.
Type system
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Data type
,
Type system
, and
Type safety
A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into
types
, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any
decidable
type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have
type loopholes
, usually unchecked
casts
that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to
type check
programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones,
infer types
, relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as
type theory
.
Typed versus untyped languages
[
edit
]
A language is
typed
if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable.
[43]
For example, the data represented by
"this text between the quotes"
is a
string
, and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running ("dynamic" type checking), resulting in a run-time
exception
. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return "-1" as the result.
A special case of typed languages is the
single-typed
languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as
REXX
or
SGML
, and have only one data type
[
dubious
-
discuss
]
-—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.
In contrast, an
untyped language
, such as most
assembly languages
, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths.
[43]
High-level untyped languages include
BCPL
,
Tcl
, and some varieties of
Forth
.
In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the
type theory
(verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.
[43]
Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type safety for finer control over the program's execution (see
casting
).
Static vis-à-vis dynamic typing
[
edit
]
In
static typing
, all expressions have their types determined before a program executes, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.
[43]
Statically-typed languages can be either
manifestly typed
or
type-inferred
. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable
declarations
). In the second case, the compiler
infers
the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically-typed languages, such as
C++
,
C#
, and
Java
, are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with functional languages such as
Haskell
and
ML
.
[44]
However, many manifestly-typed languages support partial type inference; for example,
C++
,
Java
, and
C#
all infer types in certain limited cases.
[45]
Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.
Dynamic typing
, also called
latent typing
, determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with
run-time values
rather than
textual expressions
.
[43]
As with type-inferred languages, dynamically-typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type
errors
cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making
debugging
more difficult.
Lisp
,
Smalltalk
,
Perl
,
Python
,
JavaScript
, and
Ruby
are all examples of dynamically-typed languages.
Weak and strong typing
[
edit
]
Weak typing
allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a
string
as a number.
[43]
This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at
compile time
and even at
run time
.
Strong typing
prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.
[43]
Strongly-typed languages are often termed
type-safe
or
safe
.
An alternative definition for "weakly typed" refers to languages, such as
Perl
and
JavaScript
, which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression
2 * x
implicitly converts
x
to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if
x
is
null
,
undefined
, an
Array
, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.
Strong
and
static
are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term
strongly typed
to mean
strongly, statically typed
, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply
statically typed
. Thus
C
has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.
[46]
[47]
It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be "weakly, statically typed". However, the use of the generic pointer, the
void*
pointer, does allow casting pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as
(int)
or
(char)
.
Standard library and run-time system
[
edit
]
Main article:
Standard library
Most programming languages have an associated core
library
(sometimes known as the "standard library", especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.
The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in
Java
, a string literal is defined as an instance of the
java.lang.String
class; similarly, in
Smalltalk
, an
anonymous function
expression (a "block") constructs an instance of the library's
BlockContext
class. Conversely,
Scheme
contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.
Design and implementation
[
edit
]
Main article:
Programming language design and implementation
Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing
language families
of related languages branching one from another.
[48]
[49]
But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition.
[50]
By contrast,
natural languages
have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While
constructed languages
are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.
Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one "universal" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.
[51]
The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:
Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of
programmers
.
Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.
Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from
microcontrollers
to
supercomputers
.
Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.
Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.
One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of
abstraction
. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.
[52]
Natural-language programming
has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate.
Edsger W. Dijkstra
took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed
natural-language programming
as "foolish".
[53]
Alan Perlis
was similarly dismissive of the idea.
[54]
Hybrid approaches have been taken in
Structured English
and
SQL
.
A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language
specification
and
implementation
.
Specification
[
edit
]
Main article:
Programming language specification
The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language
users
and the
implementors
can use to agree upon whether a piece of
source code
is a valid
program
in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.
A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:
An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in
natural language
(e.g., as in the
C language
), or a
formal semantics
(e.g., as in
Standard ML
[55]
and
Scheme
[56]
specifications).
A description of the behavior of a
translator
for the language (e.g., the
C++
and
Fortran
specifications). The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or formal language.
A
reference
or
model
implementation
, sometimes
written in the language being specified
(e.g.,
Prolog
or
ANSI REXX
[57]
). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.
Implementation
[
edit
]
Main article:
Programming language implementation
An
implementation
of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation:
compilation
and
interpretation
. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.
The output of a
compiler
may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach, there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of
BASIC
compile and then execute the source one line at a time.
Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.
[58]
[
better source needed
]
One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is
just-in-time compilation
. Here the
virtual machine
, just before execution, translates the blocks of
bytecode
which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.
Proprietary languages
[
edit
]
Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly
domain-specific languages
or internal
scripting languages
for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.
[
citation needed
]
Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example,
Oracle Corporation
asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the
Java programming language
,
[59]
and
Microsoft
's
C#
programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has
Common Language Runtime
(CLR) as a closed environment.
[60]
Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include
MATLAB
,
VBScript
, and
Wolfram Language
. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example,
Erlang
was originally Ericsson's internal programming language.
[61]
Use
[
edit
]
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.
[62]
Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.
[63]
Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using
pseudocode
, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.
A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A
programmer
uses the
abstractions
present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called
primitives
).
[64]
Programming
is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.
Programs for a computer might be
executed
in a
batch process
without human interaction, or a user might type
commands
in an
interactive session
of an
interpreter
. In this case the "commands" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a
Unix shell
or other
command-line interface
), without compiling, it is called a
scripting language
.
[65]
Measuring language usage
[
edit
]
Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example,
COBOL
is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large
mainframes
;
[66]
[67]
Fortran
in scientific and engineering applications;
Ada
in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time, and embedded applications; and
C
in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.
Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:
counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language
[68]
the number of books sold that teach or describe the language
[69]
estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language -  which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches
[70]
counts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search engine.
Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten most popular programming languages (in descending order by overall popularity):
Java
,
C
,
C++
,
Python
,
C#
,
JavaScript
,
VB .NET
,
R
,
PHP
, and
MATLAB
.
[71]
Dialects, flavors and implementations
[
edit
]
A
dialect
of a programming language or a
data exchange language
is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as
Scheme
and
Forth
, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate, or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new
dialect
. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a
domain-specific language
, often a subset. In the
Lisp
world, most languages that use basic
S-expression
syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly as do, say,
Racket
and
Clojure
. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The
BASIC
language has
many dialects
.
Taxonomies
[
edit
]
Further information:
Categorical list of programming languages
There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.
The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple
threads
in parallel).
Python
is an object-oriented
scripting language
.
[72]
In broad strokes, programming languages are classified by
programming paradigm
and
intended domain of use,
with
general-purpose programming languages
distinguished from
domain-specific programming languages
. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called
imperative programming
languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of
declarative programming
.
[73]
More refined paradigms include
procedural programming
,
object-oriented programming
,
functional programming
, and
logic programming
; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An
assembly language
is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose,
system programming languages
, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).
[74]
Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.
[75]
A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to the programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use
English language
keywords, while
a minority do not
. Other languages may be classified as being
deliberately esoteric
or not.

She did not stop at Fremantle but at Cape Leeuwin she turned towards India. On 4 March she struck on a ledge about 1.9 kilometres (1 nmi) off Deepdene Beach and 11 kilometres (7 mi) north-west of Cape Leeuwin. On 5 March Captain Anthony Steel decided to abandon ship. He and the chief officer took the longboat and the cutter together with 29 crew members (the

The
Pakistan Naval Air Arm
(unofficially:
Pakistan Naval Aviation
) is the
naval aviation
branch within the
Pakistan Navy
that is responsible for aerial operations from the
seaborne platform
.
[1]
The naval aviation branch is responsible for conducting the
land-based
strike capability, fleet air defence,
evacuation and extraction
,
search and rescue
,
maritime reconnaissance
, and
anti-submarine warfare
.
[2]
Early in its inception the Naval Air Arm was dependent upon the
Air Force
and the
Army
to meet its training requirement of air and ground crew.
[1]
The Commander Naval Aviation (COMNAV) command is usually held by a senior officer of
Commodore
rank who directs the field operations of the naval aviation.
History
[

Establishment
[
edit

Main article:
Indo-Pakistani War of 1971
After the
second war
with
India
in 1965, the concept of establishing the navy-based aviation service was conceived by the
Pakistan Navy
who forwarded the idea to the
Government of Pakistan
as part of the
war strategy
to sustain the purely defence of nation's maritime interests.
: 63-66
[3]
The Navy had been long aware of the usefulness and tactical advantages of the air-wing after witnessing the
United States Naval Aviators
' actions in the
Vietnam War
, and
V-Adm.
Muzaffar Hassan
, the
Navy Commander
, had made attempts to establish naval aviation but this was impossible to achieve in the absence of generous support from outside sources.
: 213
[4]
[5]
Furthermore, strong objections came from Air Marshal
Abdur Rahim Khan
, the
Air Commander
, who had been very hostile towards any idea of modernizing the navy and loath to risk its precious aircraft in over-the-water operations.
: 63
[6]
The lack of funds and donations from the
United States Navy
meant the concept never materialized though the Navy entered into talks with the
United States Government
to effect the transferring of three to four
Lockheed P-3 Orion
aircraft before the
third war
with
India
in 1971.
: 64
[6]
After the
first missile attack
in
Karachi
in 1971, the Navy hastily established the naval air arm by leasing a civilian aircraft, the
Fokker F27
, from the
Pakistan International Airlines
whose
pilots
volunteered to carry the naval observers on a
maritime reconnaissance
on 6 December 1971.
[7]
Cdre.
A. W. Bhomba, the senior
forward observer
, mistakenly identified his own ship,
PNS
Zulfiqar
forming defences at that time, and gave clearance to the
Pakistan Air Force
to carry out a bombing mission to target the ship - a
friendly fire
incident that further hampered Navy's operational scope.
[7]
After the
third war
with
India
in 1971, the Air Arm continued and was able to induct
Sea King
helicopters from the
United Kingdom
through transfers from the
Royal Navy
on 28 September 1974- leading to the establishment of the 111 ASW Squadron in the Naval Aviation.
[8]
The first naval air station,
PNS Mehran
, was inaugurated in Karachi, in the vicinity of the
Faisal Air Force Base
, on 26 September 1975.
: 155-156

Atlantique Incident
[
edit
]
Main article:
Atlantique Incident
The Atlantique Incident was a major international incident that occurred on 10 August 1999 when a Pakistan Naval Air Arm patrol aircraft—a Breguet Atlantique with 16 personnel on board—was shot down in the border area of the Kutch region by
Indian Air Force
jets. Pakistan and India both claimed the aircraft to be in their respective airspace.
Some experts stated that the Atlantique was probably conducting a "probe" on India's air defence system, mainly the radar equipment in the border area; however, they advised that it was not part of any planned aggressive military action by Pakistan.
[10]
Foreign diplomats who visited the crash site noted that the plane "may have strayed into restricted space", and that Islamabad was unable to explain why it was flying so close to the border; they however added that India's reaction to the incident was not justified.
[11]
Many countries, the G8, the permanent members of the UN Security Council, as well as the western media questioned the wisdom behind Pakistan's decision to fly military aircraft so close to the Indian border.
[12]
On 21 September 1999, Pakistan lodged a compensation claim at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, accusing India of shooting down an unarmed aircraft. Pakistan sought about US$60 million in reparations from India and compensation for the victims' families. India's attorney general, Soli Sorabjee, argued that the court did not have jurisdiction,
[13]
citing an exemption it filed in 1974 to exclude disputes between India and other Commonwealth States, and disputes covered by multi-lateral treaties.
On 21 June 2000, the 16-judge Bench headed by Gilbert Guillaume of France ruled—with a 14-2 verdict—upholding India's submission that the court had no jurisdiction in this matter.
[14]
[15]
Pakistan's claims were dropped, without recourse to appeal, and the outcome was seen as a decision highly favourable to India.
[16]
[17]
The Pakistan government had spent close to 25 million Pakistani rupees (approx. $400,000) on the case.

Rotary-wing aircraft
[
edit
]
The 111 ASW Squadron, which consists of the
Sea King
helicopters, is primarily programmed for missile launch capability
targeting dived submarines
and releasing depth charges.
[8]
In 1977, the 333 ASW squadron was established with the induction of the
Aérospatiale Alouette II
and the
Alouette III
rotary aircraft, for which the first group of naval aviators were trained in
France
.
[26]
With the acquisition of
Tariq
-class
destroyers
from the
Royal Navy
, the Navy was additionally able to acquire three
Westland Lynx
utility helicopters which were inducted into the 222 ASW Squadron.
[27]
They were later retired in 2003.
[28]
In 2006, the Navy re-equipped the 222 ASW squadron by introducing the
Harbin Z-9
helicopters which are equipped with sensors and radars to support the
F-22P class
frigates.
[29]
All Pakistan naval air arm's rotary-wing aircraft are designed for
anti-submarine warfare
and
electronic warfare
support measures.
[8]
Fixed-wing aircraft
[
edit
]
In 1973, the Navy entered into talks with
France
to acquire the
Breguet Atlantic
aircraft for its patrolling missions,
[30]
and acquired them on 14 August 1976, that established the 29 ASW Atlantic Squadron and is tasked with
maritime reconnaissance
missions.
[31]
In 1982, the 27 ASW Squadron was established with the induction of the
Fokker F-27
aircraft, followed by the acquiring of the
P-3C Orion
aircraft in 1996 after a long delay due to the imposition of the
Pressler Amendment
in 1990.
: 152
[6]
The P-3C Orion gave the Navy strike capability but one of these planes was lost due to an accident while carrying out routine exercises in local coastal waters on 29 October 1999.

History
Opened
1858
Rzeszów Główny
(
Polish
for
Rzeszów Main station
) is a
railway station
of the southeastern Polish city of
Rzeszów
, and the biggest of the
Subcarpathian Voivodeship
. According to the classification of
passenger stations
in Poland, it belongs to Class B.
The first station in
Rzeszów
was built in 1858 on the newly constructed line of the
Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis
from
Kraków
which eventually reached
Lwów
in 1861. The station was initially supposed to be located further outside the town to the north in the village of
Zaczernie
, however ultimately it was placed just north of the town square, creating a u-shaped bend on the railway.
In subsequent years, Rzeszów became an important railway junction, with additional connections to
Jasło
(southbound), and
Tarnobrzeg
's district of Ocice (northbound). During
World War I
, the station was destroyed by the retreating Russian Imperial troops. Rebuilt in the
interbellum
, it was destroyed again in 1944 by the
Wehrmacht
. The current complex was built after 1945.
Since 2018 the station platforms are undergoing an upgrade, scheduled to be completed in 2021.

The station offers connections to all major cities of Poland, also to
Kyiv
and
Lviv

(
Polish pronunciation

; 15 June 1927 - 23 March 1957)
[1]
was a Polish
figurative painter
who died in a
mountaineering
accident in 1957 when he was only 29. He is recognized by many as one of Poland's most prominent artists in the early post
World War II
era, creating a distinctly
individualistic
approach to
representational art
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Wróblewski simultaneously studied art history at the famous
Jagiellonian University
in
Kraków
in 1945-48.
Wróblewski was born in
Wilno
(modern Vilnius) on 15 June 1927, the son of law professor Bronisław Wróblewski from the
Stefan Batory University
and the painter
Krystyna Wróblewska
. He showed artistic talent at a very young age. His education was interrupted by the
German invasion of Poland
, although he was able to attend some
underground courses
; his mother introduced him to the art of
woodcut
which he practiced from 1944 to 1946.
[2]
Immediately after the end of World War II, following the
shifting of Poland's national borders
, his family moved from Wilno to
Kraków
, where he passed the
matura
exams and became a student in the Painting and Sculpture Department of Poland's oldest art school, the
Academy of Fine Arts
, where he studied between 1945 and 1952 under Zygmunt Radnicki,
Zbigniew Pronaszko (pl)
,
Hanna Rudzka-Cybisowa
and Jerzy Fedkowicz. Also between 1945 and 1948 he simultaneously studied art history at the
Jagiellonian University
, Poland's oldest university (and one of the oldest in the world).
[2]
1945-1949
[
edit
]
Executions of Polish civilian hostages following the
invasion of Poland
in 1939. Wróblewski's most famous works were devoted to their
memorialization
through art.
Through exploration in art Wroblewski devised his own formal style, with his own artistic interpretation, revealed in one of his most famous works
Executions
dating from the late 1940s illustrating his heightened expressiveness and metaphorical abilities depicting real life events.
[3]
[4]
He was also highly interested in art theoretician and
literature
critique at times, since 1948 publishing articles in
Głos Plastyków
("Artists' Voice"),

Last years
[
edit
]
In the early 1950s in the
People's Republic of Poland
Wróblewski adopted the state-favoured style of
socrealism
. After the death of Soviet premier
Joseph Stalin
and resulting
destalinization
lessened governmental pressures on various spheres of life, art included.
[5]
Wroblewski died in a mountaineering accident in
Tatry
on 23 March 1957.
[6]
He was the author of over 150
oil paintings
, 1400 drawings, dozens of other art forms and over 80 published articles. His works are featured in the collections of many Polish museums and exhibitions.
[5]
Art market
[
edit
]
In November 2021, his painting titled
Two Married Women
(
Polish
: "Dwie mężatki") was sold at an auction in Warsaw for a record 13.4 million zloty (ca. $3.2 million) becoming at the time the most expensive work of art sold on the Polish market. It was painted in 1949 and is part of the artists'
Societal Contrasts
series. It is considered an iconic work of Polish post-war art.

(

) or
Intrauterine synechiae

view.
Specialty
Gynaecology
Named after
Joseph Asherman
Heinrich Fritsch
Asherman's syndrome
(
AS
) is an acquired uterine condition that occurs when scar tissue (
adhesions
) forms inside the uterus and/or the cervix.
[1]
It is characterized by variable scarring inside the uterine cavity, where in many cases the front and back walls of the uterus stick to one another. AS can be the cause of menstrual disturbances, infertility, and placental abnormalities. Although the first case of intrauterine adhesion was published in 1894 by Heinrich Fritsch, it was only after 54 years that a full description of Asherman syndrome was carried out by
Joseph Asherman
.
[2]
A number of other terms have been used to describe the condition and related conditions including:
uterine
/
cervical atresia
,
traumatic uterine atrophy
,
sclerotic endometrium
, and
endometrial sclerosis
.
[3]
There is not any one cause of AS. Risk factors can include
myomectomy
,
cesarean section
, infections, age, genital tuberculosis, and obesity. Genetic predisposition to AS is being investigated. There are also studies that show that a severe pelvic infection, independent of surgery may cause AS.
[4]
AS can develop even if the woman has not had any uterine surgeries, trauma, or pregnancies. While rare in North America and European countries, genital tuberculosis is a cause of Asherman's in other countries such as India.
[5]
History
[
edit
]
The condition was first described in 1894 by
Heinrich Fritsch
(Fritsch, 1894)
[6]
[7]
and further characterized by the
Israeli
gynecologist
Joseph Asherman
(1889-1968)
[8]
in 1948.
[9]
It is also known as Fritsch syndrome, or Fritsch-Asherman syndrome.
Signs and symptoms
[
edit
]
It is often characterized by a decrease in flow and duration of bleeding (
absence of menstrual bleeding
,
little menstrual bleeding
, or
infrequent menstrual bleeding
)
[10]
and
infertility
.
Menstrual
anomalies are often but not always correlated with severity: adhesions restricted to only the
cervix
or lower
uterus
may block
menstruation
. Pain during
menstruation
and
ovulation
is sometimes experienced and can be attributed to blockages.
It has been reported that 88% of AS cases occur after a
D&C
is performed on a recently
pregnant
uterus
, following a missed or incomplete
miscarriage
,
birth
, or during an elective termination (
abortion
) to remove
retained products of conception
.
[11]
Causes
[
edit
]
The cavity of the
uterus
is lined by the
endometrium
. This lining is composed of two layers, the
functional layer
(adjacent to the uterine cavity) which is shed during
menstruation
and an
underlying basal layer
(adjacent to the myometrium), which is necessary for regenerating the
functional layer
. Trauma to the basal layer, typically after a
dilation and curettage
(D&C) performed after a
miscarriage
, or
delivery
, or
abortion
, can lead to the development of intrauterine scars resulting in
adhesions
that can obliterate the cavity to varying degrees. In the extreme, the whole cavity can be scarred and occluded. Even with relatively few scars, the
endometrium
may fail to respond to
estrogen
.
[

Asherman's syndrome affects women of all races and ages equally, suggesting no underlying genetic predisposition for its development.
[12]
AS can result from other pelvic surgeries including
cesarean sections
,
[12]
[13]
removal of fibroid tumours (
myomectomy
)
[14]
and from other causes such as
IUDs
, pelvic
irradiation
,
schistosomiasis

Chronic endometritis from genital tuberculosis is a significant cause of severe intrauterine adhesions (IUA) in the developing world, often resulting in total obliteration of the uterine cavity which is difficult to treat.
[17]
An artificial form of AS can be surgically induced by
endometrial ablation
in women with excessive uterine bleeding, in lieu of
hysterectomy

Diagnosis

Hysteroscopic view of intrauterine adhesions
HSG
showing filling defects at the adhesion sites. Additionally, this uterus appears to be
T-shaped
.
The history of a
pregnancy
event followed by a D&C leading to secondary amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea is typical.
Hysteroscopy
is the gold standard for diagnosis.
[18]
Imaging by
sonohysterography
or
hysterosalpingography
will reveal the extent of the scar formation. Ultrasound is not a reliable method of diagnosing Asherman's Syndrome. Hormone studies show normal levels consistent with reproductive function.

Classification
[
edit
]
Various classification systems were developed to describe Asherman's syndrome (citations to be added), some taking into account the amount of functioning residual endometrium, menstrual pattern, obstetric history and other factors which are thought to play a role in determining the prognoses. With the advent of techniques which allow visualization of the uterus, classification systems were developed to take into account the location and severity of adhesions inside the uterus. This is useful as mild cases with adhesions restricted to the cervix may present with amenorrhea and infertility, showing that symptoms alone do not necessarily reflect severity. Other patients may have no adhesions but amenorrhea and infertility due to a sclerotic atrophic endometrium. The latter form has the worst prognosis.

Prevention
[
edit
]
A 2013
review
concluded that there were no studies reporting on the link between intrauterine adhesions and long-term reproductive outcome after miscarriage, while similar pregnancy outcomes were reported subsequent to surgical management (e.g. D&C), medical management or conservative management (that is,
watchful waiting
).
[19]
There is an association between surgical intervention in the uterus and the development of intrauterine adhesions, and between intrauterine adhesions and pregnancy outcomes, but there is still no clear evidence of any method of prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
[19]
In theory, the recently pregnant uterus is particularly soft under the influence of hormones and hence, easily injured. D&C (including dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation/suction curettage and manual vacuum aspiration) is a blind, invasive procedure, making it difficult to avoid endometrial trauma. Medical alternatives to D&C for evacuation of retained placenta/products of conception exist including
misoprostol
and
mifepristone
. Studies show this less invasive and cheaper method to be an efficacious, safe and an acceptable alternative to surgical management for most women.
[20]
[21]
It was suggested as early as in 1993
[22]
that the incidence of IUA might be lower following medical evacuation (e.g. Misoprostol) of the uterus, thus avoiding any intrauterine instrumentation. So far, one study supports this proposal, showing that women who were treated for missed miscarriage with misoprostol did not develop IUA, while 7.7% of those undergoing D&C did.
[23]
The advantage of misoprostol is that it can be used for evacuation not only following miscarriage, but also following birth for retained placenta or hemorrhaging.
[
citation needed
]
Alternatively, D&C could be performed under ultrasound guidance rather than as a blind procedure. This would enable the surgeon to end scraping the lining when all retained tissue has been removed, avoiding injury.
[
citation needed
]
Early monitoring during pregnancy to identify miscarriage can prevent the development of, or as the case may be, the recurrence of AS, as the longer the period after fetal death following D&C, the more likely adhesions may be to occur.
[22]
Therefore, immediate evacuation following fetal death may prevent IUA.The use of hysteroscopic surgery instead of D&C to remove retained products of conception or placenta is another alternative that could theoretically improve future pregnancy outcomes, although it could be less effective if tissue is abundant. Also, hysteroscopy is not a widely or routinely used technique and requires expertise.
[
citation needed
]
There is no data to indicate that suction D&C is less likely than sharp curette to result in Asherman's. A recent article describes three cases of women who developed intrauterine adhesions following manual vacuum aspiration.
[24]
Intrauterine adhesions also form after
hysteroscopic
surgery such as
myomectomy
, polypectomy or septum removal.
[25]
[26]
Mechanical barriers such as Womed Leaf
[27]
or hyaluronic acid gels can be used to prevent formation of IUA after such adhesiogenic procedures or after D&C.
[28]
[29]
[30]
[31]
Treatment
[
edit
]
Fertility may sometimes be restored by removal of adhesions, depending on the severity of the initial trauma and other individual patient factors. Operative
hysteroscopy
is used for visual inspection of the uterine cavity during adhesion dissection (adhesiolysis). However, hysteroscopy is yet to become a routine gynaecological procedure and only 15% of US gynecologists perform office hysteroscopy.
[32]
Adhesion dissection can be technically difficult and must be performed with care in order to not create new scars and further exacerbate the condition. In more severe cases, adjunctive measures such as laparoscopy are used in conjunction with hysteroscopy as a protective measure against uterine perforation. Microscissors are usually used to cut adhesions. Electrocauterization is not recommended.
[33]
As IUA frequently reform after surgery, techniques have been developed to prevent recurrence of adhesions. Methods to prevent adhesion reformation include the use of mechanical barriers (Foley catheter, saline-filled balloon uterine stents,
[34]
gel barriers (Seprafilm, Spraygel, autocrosslinked hyaluronic acid gel
Hyalobarrier
) and mechanical barrier film (Womed Leaf)
[27]
to maintain opposing walls apart during healing,
[35]
[36]
[37]
thereby preventing the reformation of adhesions. Antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in the presence of mechanical barriers to reduce the risk of possible infections. A common pharmacological method for preventing reformation of adhesions is sequential hormonal therapy with
estrogen
followed by a progestin to stimulate endometrial growth and prevent opposing walls from fusing together.
[38]
However, there have been no
randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) comparing post-surgical adhesion reformation with and without hormonal treatment and the ideal dosing regimen or length of estrogen therapy is not known. A recent meta analysis compared different post surgical prevention barrier strategies and concluded that there was no single clearly superior treatment.
[39]
Furthermore, diagnostic severity and outcomes are assessed according to different criteria (e.g. menstrual pattern, adhesion reformation rate, conception rate, live birth rate). Clearly, more comparable studies are needed in which reproductive outcome can be analysed systematically.
[
citation needed
]
Follow-up tests (HSG, hysteroscopy or SHG) are necessary to ensure that adhesions have not reformed. Further surgery may be necessary to restore a normal uterine cavity. According to a recent study among 61 patients, the overall rate of adhesion recurrence was 27.9% and in severe cases this was 41.9%.
[40]
Another study found that postoperative adhesions reoccur in close to 50% of severe AS and in 21.6% of moderate cases.
[18]
Mild IUA, unlike moderate to severe synechiae, do not appear to reform.
[
citation needed
]
Prognosis
[
edit
]
Amniotic sheet on ultrasound
The extent of adhesion formation is critical. Mild to moderate adhesions can usually be treated with success. Extensive obliteration of the uterine cavity or fallopian tube openings (
ostia
) and deep endometrial or myometrial trauma may require several surgical interventions and/or hormone therapy or even be uncorrectable. If the uterine cavity is adhesion free but the ostia remain obliterated,
IVF
remains an option. If the uterus has been irreparably damaged,
surrogacy
or
adoption
may be the only options.
[
citation needed
]
Depending on the degree of severity, AS may result in
infertility
, repeated
miscarriages
, pain from trapped blood, and future obstetric complications
[18]
If left untreated, the obstruction of
menstrual
flow resulting from
adhesions
can lead to
endometriosis
in some cases.
[3]
[41]
Patients who carry a
pregnancy
even after treatment of IUA may have an increased risk of having abnormal placentation including
placenta accreta
[42]
where the placenta invades the
uterus
more deeply, leading to complications in placental separation after delivery. Premature delivery,
[38]
second-trimester pregnancy loss,
[43]
and uterine rupture
[44]
are other reported complications. They may also develop
incompetent cervix
where the cervix can no longer support the growing weight of the fetus, the pressure causes the placenta to rupture and the mother goes into premature labour.
Cerclage
is a surgical stitch which helps support the cervix if needed.
[43]
Pregnancy and live birth rate has been reported to be related to the initial severity of the adhesions with 93, 78, and 57% pregnancies achieved after treatment of mild, moderate and severe adhesions, respectively and resulting in 81, 66, and 32% live birth rates, respectively.
[18]
The overall pregnancy rate after adhesiolysis was 60% and the live birth rate was 38.9% according to one study.
[45]
Age is another factor contributing to fertility outcomes after treatment of AS. For women under 35 years of age treated for severe adhesions, pregnancy rates were 66.6% compared to 23.5% in women older than 35.
[42]
Epidemiology
[
edit
]
AS has a reported
incidence
of 25% of D&Cs performed 1-4 weeks post-partum,
[41]
[13]
[46]
up to 30.9% of D&Cs performed for missed miscarriages and 6.4% of D&Cs performed for incomplete miscarriages.
[47]
In another study, 40% of patients who underwent repeated D&C for retained products of conception after missed miscarriage or retained placenta developed AS.
[48]
In the case of missed miscarriages, the time period between fetal demise and curettage may increase the likelihood of adhesion formation due to fibroblastic activity of the remaining tissue.
[12]
[49]
The risk of AS also increases with the number of procedures: one study estimated the risk to be 16% after one D&C and 32% after three or more D&Cs.
[22]
However, a single curettage often underlies the condition.
In an attempts to estimate the
prevalence
of AS in the general population, it was found in 1.5% of women undergoing
hysterosalpingography
HSG,
[50]
and between 5 and 39% of women with recurrent miscarriage.
[51]
[52]
[53]
After miscarriage, a
review
estimated the prevalence of AS to be approximately 20% (95%
confidence interval
: 13% to 28%).

Observation in evolutionary biology
Not to be confused with
Haldane's principle
.
In humans, barring intersex conditions causing
aneuploidy
and other unusual states, it is the male that is
heterogametic
, with XY sex chromosomes.
Haldane's rule
is an observation about the early stage of
speciation
, formulated in 1922 by the British
evolutionary biologist
J. B. S. Haldane
, that states that if — in a
species
hybrid
— only one sex is inviable or
sterile
, that sex is more likely to be the
heterogametic sex
. The heterogametic sex is the one with two different
sex chromosomes
; in
therian mammals
,
[a]
for example, this is the male.
[2]
Overview
[
edit
]
Haldane himself described the rule as:
When in the
F1
offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterozygous sex (heterogametic sex).
[3]
Haldane's rule applies to the vast majority of heterogametic organisms. This includes the case where two species make secondary contact in an area of
sympatry
and form hybrids after
allopatric speciation
has occurred.
The rule includes both male heterogametic (
XY
or
XO-type sex determination
, such as found in
mammals
and
Drosophila
fruit flies) and female heterogametic (
ZW
or
Z0-type sex determination
, as found in
birds
and
butterflies
), and some
dioecious
plants such as
campions
.
[4]
Hybrid dysfunction (sterility and inviability) is a major form of post-
zygotic
reproductive isolation
, which occurs in early stages of speciation. Evolution can produce a similar pattern of isolation in a vast array of different organisms. However, the actual mechanisms leading to Haldane's rule in different taxa remain largely undefined.
Hypotheses
[
edit
]
Many different hypotheses have been advanced to address the evolutionary mechanisms to produce Haldane's rule. Currently, the most popular explanation for Haldane's rule is the composite hypothesis, which divides Haldane's rule into multiple subdivisions, including sterility, inviability, male heterogamety, and female heterogamety. The composite hypothesis states that Haldane's rule in different subdivisions has different causes. Individual genetic mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive, and these mechanisms may act together to cause Haldane's rule in any given subdivision.
[5]
[6]
In contrast to these views that emphasize genetic mechanisms, another view hypothesizes that population dynamics during population divergence may cause Haldane's rule.
[7]
The main genetic hypotheses are:
Dominance: Heterogametic hybrids are affected by all X-linked alleles (be they recessive or dominant) causing incompatibilities due to divergent alleles being brought together. However, homogametic hybrids are only affected by dominant deleterious X-linked alleles. Heterogametic hybrids, which carry only a single copy of a given
X-linked
gene, will be affected by mutations regardless of dominance. Thus, an X-linked incompatibility between diverging populations is more likely to be expressed in the heterogametic sex than in the homogametic sex.
The "faster male": Male genes are thought to evolve faster due to
sexual selection
.
[6]
As a result, male sterility becomes more evident in male heterogametic taxa (XY sex determination). This hypothesis conflicts with Haldane's rule in male homogametic taxa, in which females are more affected by hybrid inferiority. It therefore only applies to male sterility in taxa with XY sex determination, according to the composite theory.
Meiotic drive
: In hybrid populations, selfish genetic elements inactivate sperm cells (i.e.: an X-linked drive factor inactivates a Y-bearing sperm and vice versa).
The "faster X": Genes on hemizygous chromosomes may evolve more quickly by enhancing selection on possible recessive alleles causing a larger effect in reproductive isolation.
[8]
Differential selection: Hybrid incompatibilities affecting the heterogametic sex and homogametic sex are fundamentally different isolating mechanisms, which makes heterogametic inferiority (sterility/inviability) more visible or preserved in nature.
[7]
Data from multiple phylogenetic groups support a combination of dominance and faster X-chromosome theories.
[9]
However, it has recently been argued that dominance theory can not explain Haldane's rule in marsupials since both sexes experience the same incompatibilities due to paternal
X-inactivation
in females.
[10]
The dominance hypothesis is the core of the composite theory, and X-linked recessive/dominance effects have been demonstrated in many cases to cause hybrid incompatibilities. There is also supporting evidence for the faster male and meiotic drive hypotheses. For example, a significant reduction of male-driven gene flow is observed in
Asian elephants
, suggesting faster evolution of male traits.
[11]
Although the rule was initially stated in context of
diploid
organisms with chromosomal
sex determination
, it has recently been argued that it can be extended to certain species lacking chromosomal sex determination, such as
haplodiploids
[12]
and
hermaphrodites
.
[9]
Exceptions
[
edit
]
In some instances, the homogametic sex turns out to be inviable while the heterogametic sex is viable and fertile. This is seen in
Drosophila
fruit flies.

Costa Rican politician
Steller's parliamentary photo.
Erick Rodríguez Steller
(
San Ramón
, April 11, 1969) is a
Costa Rican
politician, deputy in Costa Rica in the 2018-2022 period. He was elected by the
National Integration Party
during
Juan Diego Castro Fernández
candidacy, but then declared himself an independent deputy, a month before taking office soon after Castro did the same.
[1]
Later, he would announce his incorporation into the
New Generation Party
.
[2]
[3]
[4]
Steller was one of the only seven deputies who refused to acknowledge the triumph of the
US candidate
Joe Biden
, claiming "that there was suspicion of fraud".
[5]
Controversies
[
edit
]
In October 2020, he became known for mocking Costa Rica's health minister, Daniel Salas, upon learning that his father was hospitalized in the middle of the
COVID-19 pandemic
, the deputy declared: "The superman Salas did not give on his feet, even his father got sick" which generated outrage in the population and some deputies. Days after these comments, Minister Salas's father died.
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
He also received a lawsuit for sexual and workplace harassment from a female aid in his office. Among the accusations, the aid attributed some insults to the deputy such as: "stupid", "mother Teresa", "that the math teacher died on you" and "you are like this because no one fucks with you." She also affirmed that Steller made comments to ridicule her in front of the entire office, emphasizing: "You don't not drink, you have no partner, you don't go out, you have no friends, you don't smoke, why are you alive?". The aid also denounced the existence of a
WhatsApp
chat called "DEATH TO LGBTI AND NICAS" (in reference to
Nicaraguans
,
Costa Rica's main immigrant population
) which was originally the chat for the deputy's campaign. For these actions, the ideas of the deputy have been compared with those of the dictator
Adolf Hitler
,
[11]
due to the
homophobia
,
misogyny
and
xenophobia
with which he has been linked on various occasions.
[12]
[13]
In 2020, the Public Ministry reported that it is investigating Steller for the crimes of illicit enrichment and illegal recognition of labor benefits. This is because the legislator charges his office aids for the gasoline assigned to him by the
Legislative Assembly
.
[14]
A year earlier, in June 2019, the deputy was photographed buying beers, while the plenary was discussing the re-election of
Justice Paul Rueda
. Faced with these photographs, he justified himself by saying that “his vote was not going to be of any importance.”

The
Fred G. Redmon Bridge
, also known as the
Selah Creek Bridge
, is a twin
arch bridge
in the
northwest
United States
, in
Yakima County, Washington
. It carries
Interstate 82
across Selah Creek near
Selah
, between
Yakima
and
Ellensburg
.
Construction
[
edit
]
The bridge was opened to traffic on November 2, 1971. It was constructed by
Peter Kiewit & Sons
,
[1]
who won the contract with a bid of $4,356,070 (equivalent to about $36,658,000 in 2023).
[2]
[3]
The bridge was part of a 2.8-mile (4.5 km) long, $1.7 million (equivalent to $14 million in 2023)
[2]
segment of the
Interstate 82
freeway construction through the area.
[4]
At the time it was built, it was the longest concrete arch bridge in the United States,
[5]
[6]
surpassed only by the 866-foot (264 m)
Sandö Bridge

Reading
is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of
letters
,
symbols
, etc., especially by
sight
or
touch
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
For educators and
researchers
, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition,
orthography
(spelling),
alphabetics
,
phonics
,
phonemic awareness
, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.
[5]
[6]
Other types of reading and writing, such as
pictograms
(e.g., a
hazard symbol
and an
emoji
), are not based on speech-based
writing systems
.
[7]
The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of
braille
).

Overview
[
edit
]
Volunteer reads to a girl at the Casa Hogar de las Niñas in
Mexico City
Reading is typically an individual activity, done silently, although on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners; or reads aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension. Before the reintroduction of
separated text
(spaces between words) in the late
Middle Ages
, the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.
[10]
[11]
Major predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and non-alphabetic scripts are oral language skills,
[12]
phonological awareness
,
rapid automatized naming
and
verbal IQ
.
[13]
As a
leisure activity
, children and adults read because it is pleasant and interesting.  In the US, about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year.
[14]
About 5% read more than 50 books per year.
[14]
Americans read more if they: have more education, read fluently and easily, are female, live in cities, and have higher
socioeconomic status
.
[14]
Children become better readers when they know more about the world in general, and when they perceive reading as fun rather than another chore to be performed.
[14]
Reading vs. literacy
[
edit
]
Reading is an essential part of
literacy
, yet from a historical perspective literacy is about having the ability to both read and write.
[15]
[16]
[17]
[18]
And, since the 1990s some organizations have defined literacy in a wide variety of ways that may go beyond the traditional ability to read and write. The following are some examples:
"the ability to read and write ... in all media (print or electronic), including digital literacy"
[19]
"the ability to ... understand ... using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts"
[20]
[21]
[22]
"the ability to read, write, speak and listen"
[23]
"having the skills to be able to read, write and speak to understand and create meaning"
[24]
"the ability to ... communicate using visual, audible, and digital materials"
[25]
[26]
"the ability to use printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential".
[27]
It includes three types of adult literacy: prose (e.g., a newspaper article), documents (e.g., a bus schedule), and
quantitative literacy
(e.g., using arithmetic operations in a product advertisement).
[28]
[29]
In the academic field, some view literacy in a more philosophical manner and propose the concept of "multiliteracies". For example, they say, "this huge shift from traditional print-based literacy to 21st century multiliteracies reflects the impact of communication technologies and multimedia on the evolving nature of texts, as well as the skills and dispositions associated with the consumption, production, evaluation, and distribution of those texts (Borsheim, Meritt, & Reed, 2008, p. 87)".
[30]
[31]
According to cognitive neuroscientist
Mark Seidenberg
these "multiple literacies" have allowed educators to change the topic from reading and writing to "Literacy". He goes on to say that some educators, when faced with criticisms of how reading is taught, "didn't alter their practices, they changed the subject".
[32]
Also, some organizations might include numeracy skills and technology skills separately but alongside of literacy skills.
[33]
In addition, since the 1940s the term literacy is often used to mean having knowledge or skill in a particular field (e.g.,
computer literacy
,
ecological literacy
,
health literacy
,
media literacy
, quantitative literacy (
numeracy
)
[29]
and
visual literacy
).
[34]
[35]
[36]
[37]
Writing systems
[
edit
]
Main article:
Writing system
In order to understand a text, it is usually necessary to understand the spoken language associated with that text. In this way, writing systems are distinguished from many other symbolic communication systems.
[38]
Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts, and often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. The great benefit of writing systems is their ability to maintain a persistent record of information expressed in a language, which can be retrieved independently of the initial act of formulation.
[38]
Cognitive benefits
[

Reading for pleasure has been linked to increased cognitive progress in vocabulary and mathematics during adolescence.
[39]
[40]
Sustained high volume lifetime reading has been associated with high levels of academic attainment.
[41]
Research suggests that reading can improve stress management,
[42]
memory,
[42]
focus,
[43]
writing skills,
[43]
and
imagination
.
[44]
The cognitive benefits of reading continue into mid-life and the senior years.
[45]
[46]
[47]
Research suggests that reading books and writing are among the brain-stimulating activities that can slow down cognitive decline in seniors.
[48]
State of reading achievement
[

Reading achievement: national and international reports
Reading has been the subject of considerable research and reporting for decades. Many organizations measure and report on
reading achievement
for children and adults (e.g.,
NAEP
,
PIRLS
,
PISA
PIAAC
, and
EQAO
).
Researchers have concluded that approximately 95% of students can be taught to read by the end of the first or second year of school, yet in many countries 20% or more do not meet that expectation.
[49]
[50]
According to the 2019
Nation's Report card
, 34% of grade four students in the United States failed to perform at or above the
Basic reading level
. There was a significant difference by race and ethnicity (e.g., black students at 52% and white students at 23%). After the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic
the average basic reading score dropped by 3% in 2022.
[51]
See more about
the breakdown by ethnicity in 2019 and 2022 here
. According to a 2023 study in California, many teenagers who've spent time in California's juvenile detention facilities get high school diplomas with grade-school reading skills. "There are kids getting their high school diplomas who aren't able to even read and write." During a five-year span beginning in 2018, 85% of these students who graduated from high school did not pass a 12th-grade reading assessment.
[52]
Between 2013 and 2022, 30 US States passed laws or implemented new policies related to evidence-based reading instruction.
[53]
In 2023, New York City set about to require schools to teach reading with an emphasis on
phonics
. In that city, less than half of the students from the third grade to the eighth grade of school scored as proficient on state reading exams. More than 63% of Black and Hispanic test-takers did not make the grade.
[54]
Globally, the
COVID-19 pandemic
created a substantial overall learning deficit in reading abilities and other academic areas. It arose early in the pandemic and persists over time, and is particularly large among children from low socio-economic backgrounds.
[55]
[56]
In the US, several research studies show that, in the absent of additional support, there is nearly a 90 percent chance that a poor reader in Grade 1 will remain a poor reader.
[57]
In Canada, the province of
Ontario
reported that 27% of grade three students did not meet the provincial reading standards in 2023.
[58]
Also in Ontario, 53% of grade three students with special education needs (students who have an Individual Education Plan), were not meeting the provincial standards in 2022.
[59]
The province of
Nova Scotia
reported that 32% of grade three students did not meet the provincial reading standards in 2022.
[60]
The province of
New Brunswick
reported that 43.4% and 30.7% did not meet the Reading Comprehension Achievement Levels for grades four and six respectively in 2023.
[61]
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (
PIRLS
) publishes reading achievement for fourth graders in 50 countries.
[62]
The five countries with the highest overall reading average are the Russian Federation, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland and Finland. Some others are: England 10th, United States 15th, Australia 21st, Canada 23rd, and New Zealand 33rd.
[63]
[64]
[65]
The Programme for International Student Assessment (
PISA
) measures 15-year-old school pupils scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.
[66]
The reading levels of adults, ages 16-65, in 39 countries are reported by the
Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
(PIAAC).
[67]
Between 2011 and 2018, PIAAC reports the percentage of adults reading
at-or-below level one
(the lowest of five levels). Some examples are Japan 4.9%, Finland 10.6%, Netherlands 11.7%, Australia 12.6%, Sweden 13.3%, Canada 16.4%, England (UK) 16.4%, and the United States 16.9%.
[68]
According to the
World Bank
, 53% of all children in low-and-middle-income countries suffer from 'learning poverty'. In 2019, using data from the
UNESCO
Institute for Statistics, they published a report entitled
Ending Learning Poverty: What will it take?
.
[69]
Learning poverty is defined as being unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10.
Although they say that all foundational skills are important, include reading, numeracy, basic reasoning ability, socio-emotional skills, and others - they focus specifically on reading. Their reasoning is that reading proficiency is an easily understood metric of learning, reading is a student's gateway to learning in every other area, and reading proficiency can serve as a proxy for foundational learning in other subjects.
They suggest five pillars to reduce learning poverty: 1) learners are prepared and motivated to learn, 2) teachers at all levels are effective and valued, 3) classrooms are equipped for learning, 4) Schools are safe and inclusive spaces, and 5) education systems are well-managed.
Learning to read
[
edit
]
Researchers have concluded that approximately 95% of students can be taught to read by the end of the first or second year of school, yet in many countries 20% or more do not meet that expectation.
[70]
[50]
Learning to read
or
reading skills acquisition
is the acquisition and practice of the skills necessary to understand the meaning behind printed words. For a skilled reader, the act of reading feels simple, effortless, and automatic.
[71]
However, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive, linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age. As one of the four core language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing),
[72]
[73]
reading is vital to gaining a command of written language.
In the United States and elsewhere, it is widely believed that students who lack proficiency in reading by the end of grade three may face obstacles for the rest of their academic career.
[74]
[75]
[76]
For example, it is estimated that they would not be able to read half of the material they will encounter in grade four.
[77]
In 2019, among American fourth-graders in public schools, only 58% of Asian, 45% of Caucasian, 23% of Hispanic, and 18% of Black students performed at or above the
proficient level
of the
Nation's Report Card
.
[78]
Also, in 2012, in the
United Kingdom
it has been reported that 15-year-old students are reading at the age of 12-year-old students.
[79]
As a result, many governments put practices in place to ensure that students are reading at grade level by the end of grade three. An example of this is the Third Grade Reading Guarantee created by the State of
Ohio
in 2017. This is a program to identify students from kindergarten through grade three that are behind in reading, and provide support to make sure they are on track for reading success by the end of grade three.
[80]
[81]
This is also known as
remedial education
. Another example is the policy in England whereby any pupil who is struggling to decode words properly by year three must "urgently" receive help through a "rigorous and systematic phonics programme".
[82]
In 2016, out of 50 countries, the United States achieved the 15th highest score in grade-four reading ability.
[83]
The ten countries with the highest overall reading average are the Russian Federation, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Finland, Poland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Chinese Taipei and England (UK). Some others are: Australia (21st), Canada (23rd), New Zealand (33rd), France (34th), Saudi Arabia (44th), and South Africa (50th).
Spoken language: the foundation of reading
[
edit
]
Spoken language is the foundation of learning to read (long before children see any letters) and children's knowledge of the phonological structure of language is a good predictor of early reading ability. Spoken language is dominant for most of childhood; however, reading ultimately catches up and surpasses speech.
[84]
[85]
[86]
[87]
By their first birthday most children have learned all the sounds in their spoken language. However, it takes longer for them to learn the phonological form of words and to begin developing a spoken vocabulary.
[12]
Children acquire a spoken language in a few years. Five-to-six-year-old English learners have vocabularies of 2,500 to 5,000 words, and add 5,000 words per year for the first several years of schooling. This rapid learning rate cannot be accounted for by the instruction they receive. Instead, children learn that the meaning of a new word can be inferred because it occurs in the same context as familiar words (e.g.,
lion
is often seen with
cowardly
and
king
).
[88]
As British linguist
John Rupert Firth
says, "You shall know a word by the company it keeps".
The environment in which children live may also impact their ability to acquire reading skills. Children who are regularly exposed to chronic environmental noise pollution, such as highway traffic noise, have been known to show decreased ability to discriminate between
phonemes
(oral language sounds) as well as lower reading scores on standardized tests.
[89]
Reading to children: necessary but not sufficient
[
edit
]
Reading to children is not the same as teaching children to read; however, it does help if the children's attention is directed to the words on the page as they are being read to.
[90]
[91]
Children learn to speak naturally - by listening to other people speak. However, reading is not a natural process, and many children need to learn to read through a process that involves "systematic guidance and feedback".
[92]
[93]
[94]
[95]
So, "reading to children is not the same as teaching children to read".
[96]
Nonetheless, reading to children is important because it socializes them to the activity of reading; it engages them; it expands their knowledge of spoken language; and it enriches their linguistic ability by hearing new and novel words and grammatical structures.
However, there is some evidence that "shared reading" with children does help to improve reading if the children's attention is directed to the words on the page as they are being read to.
[90]
[91]
Stages to skilled reading
[
edit
]
See also:
Reading § Teaching reading
The path to skilled reading involves learning the
alphabetic principle
,
phonemic awareness
,
phonics
, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.
[97]
British psychologist
Uta Frith
introduced a three stages model to acquire skilled reading. Stage one is the
logographic or pictorial stage
where students attempt to grasp words as objects, an artificial form of reading. Stage two is the
phonological stage
where students learn the relationship between the graphemes (letters) and the phonemes (sounds). Stage three is the
orthographic stage
where students read familiar words more quickly than unfamiliar words, and word length gradually ceases to play a role.
[98]
Optimum age to learn to read
[
edit
]
There is some debate as to the optimum age to teach children to read.
The
Common Core State Standards Initiative
(CCSS) in the United States has standards for foundational reading skills in kindergarten and grade one that include instruction in print concepts, phonological awareness, phonics, word recognition and fluency.
[99]
However, some critics of CCSS say that "To achieve reading standards usually calls for long hours of drill and worksheets - and reduces other vital areas of learning such as math, science, social studies, art, music and creative play".
[100]
The
PISA 2007
OECD data from 54 countries demonstrates "no association between school entry age ... and reading achievement at age 15".
[101]
Also, a German study of 50 kindergartens compared children who, at age 5, had spent a year either "academically focused", or "play-arts focused" and found that in time the two groups became inseparable in reading skill.
[102]
The authors conclude that the effects of early reading are like "watering a garden before a rainstorm; the earlier watering is rendered undetectable by the rainstorm, the watering wastes precious water, and the watering detracts the gardener from other important preparatory groundwork".
[101]
Some scholars favor a
developmentally appropriate practice
(DPA) in which formal instruction on reading begins when children are about six or seven years old. And to support that theory some point out that children in
Finland
start school at age seven (Finland ranked 5th in the 2016
PIRLS
international grade four reading achievement.)
[103]
In a discussion on academic kindergartens, professor of child development
David Elkind
has argued that, since "there is no solid research demonstrating that early academic training is superior to (or worse than) the more traditional, hands-on model of early education", educators should defer to developmental approaches that provide young children with ample time and opportunity to explore the natural world on their own terms.
[104]
Elkind emphasized the principle that "early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught".
[104]
In response,
Grover J. Whitehurst
, Director, Brown Center on Education Policy, (part of
Brookings Institution
)
[105]
said David Elkind is relying too much on philosophies of education rather than science and research. He continues to say education practices are "doomed to cycles of fad and fancy" until they become more based on
evidence-based practice
.
[106]
On the subject of Finland's academic results, as some researchers point out, prior to starting school Finnish children must participate in one year of compulsory free pre-primary education and most are reading before they start school.
[107]
[108]
And, with respect to
developmentally appropriate practice
(DPA), in 2019 the
National Association for the Education of Young Children
, Washington, D.C., released a draft position paper on DPA saying "The notion that young children are not ready for academic subject matter is a misunderstanding of developmentally appropriate practice; particularly in grades 1 through 3, almost all subject matter can be taught in ways that are meaningful and engaging for each child".
[109]
And, researchers at
The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential
say it is a myth that early readers are bored or become trouble makers in school.
[110]
Other researchers and educators favor limited amounts of literacy instruction at the age of four and five, in addition to non-academic, intellectually stimulating activities.

in the UK have found that starting literacy teaching in preschool has "been consistently found to have a positive effect on early learning outcomes"
[112]
and that "beginning early years education at a younger age appears to have a high positive impact on learning outcomes".
[113]
This supports current standard practice in the UK which includes developing children's phonemic awareness in preschool and teaching reading from age four.
A study in
Chicago
reports that an
early education program
for children from low-income families is estimated to generate $4 to $11 of economic benefits over a child's lifetime for every dollar spent initially on the program, according to a cost-benefit analysis funded by the
National Institutes of Health
. The program is staffed by certified teachers and offers "instruction in reading and math, group activities and educational field trips for children ages 3 through 9".
[114]
[115]
There does not appear to be any definitive research about the "magic window" to begin reading instruction.
[108]
However, there is also no definitive research to suggest that starting early causes any harm. Researcher
Timothy Shanahan
, suggests, "Start teaching reading from the time you have kids available to teach, and pay attention to how they respond to this instruction - both in terms of how well they are learning what you are teaching, and how happy and invested they seem to be. If you haven't started yet, don't feel guilty, just get going".
[108]
Reading instruction by grade level

Some education researchers suggest the teaching of the various reading components by specific grade levels.

Reading development
[
edit
]
According to some researchers, learners (children and adults) progress through several stages while first learning to read in English, and then refining their reading skills. One of the recognized experts in this area is
Harvard
professor
Jeanne Sternlicht Chall
. In 1983 she published a book entitled
Stages of Reading Development
that proposed six stages.
[117]
[118]
Subsequently, in 2008
Maryanne Wolf
,
UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies
, published a book entitled
Proust and the Squid
in which she describes her view of the following five stages of reading development.
[119]
[120]
It is normal that children will move through these stages at different rates; however, typical ages for children in the United States are shown below.
Emerging pre-reader: 6 months to 6 years old
[
edit
]
Reading time at a primary school in rural
Lao PDR
, Southeast Asia. In 2017, approximately 70% of five-year-old children are not enrolled in Early Childhood Education programs, with those in hard-to-reach areas and from poor families being the most excluded.
[121]
The daily reading period shown here uses books provided by
Big Brother Mouse
, a not-for-profit that promotes reading in Lao schools and villages.
[122]
The emerging pre-reader stage, also known as
reading readiness
, usually lasts for the first five years of a child's life.
[123]
Children typically speak their first few words before their first birthday.
[124]
Educators and parents help learners to develop their skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing.
[125]
Reading to children helps them to develop their vocabulary, a love of reading, and
phonemic awareness
, i.e. the ability to hear and manipulate the individual sounds (
phonemes
) of oral language. Children will often "read" stories they have memorized. However, in the late 1990s United States' researchers found that the traditional way of reading to children made little difference in their later ability to read because children spend relatively little time actually looking at the text. Yet, in a shared reading program with four-year-old children, teachers found that directing children's attention to the letters and words (e.g. verbally or pointing to the words) made a significant difference in early reading, spelling and comprehension.
[126]
[91]
[127]
[128]
Novice reader: 6 to 7 years old
[
edit
]
Novice readers continue to develop their phonemic awareness, and come to realize that the letters (
graphemes
) connect to the sounds (
phonemes
) of the language; known as decoding,
phonics
, and the
alphabetic principle
.
[129]
They may also memorize the most common letter patterns and some of the high-frequency words that do not necessarily follow basic phonological rules (e.g.
have and who
). However, it is a mistake to assume a reader understands the meaning of a text merely because they can decode it. Vocabulary and oral language comprehension are also important parts of text comprehension as described in the
Simple view of reading
,
Scarborough's reading rope
, and
The active view of reading model
. Reading and speech are codependent: reading promotes vocabulary development and a richer vocabulary facilitates skilled reading.
[130]
Decoding reader: 7 to 9 years old
[
edit
]
The transition from the novice reader stage to the decoding stage is marked by a reduction of painful pronunciations and in its place the sounds of a smoother, more confident reader.
[131]
In this phase the reader adds at least 3,000 words to what they can decode. For example, in the English language, readers now learn the variations of the vowel-based
rimes
(e.g. s
at
, m
at
, c
at
)
[132]
and
vowel
pairs (also
digraph
) (e.g. r
ai
n, pl
ay
, b
oa
t)
[133]
As readers move forward, they learn the make up of
morphemes
(i.e. stems, roots,
prefixes
and
suffixes
). They learn the common morphemes such as "s" and "ed" and see them as "sight chunks". "The faster a child can see that
beheaded
is
be + head + ed"
, the faster they will become a more fluent reader.
In the beginning of this stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no understanding of the words being read. It is nevertheless an important stage, allowing the child to achieve their ultimate goal of becoming fluent and automatic.
It is in the decoding phase that the child will get to what the story is really about, and to learn to re-read a passage when necessary so as to truly understand it.
Fluent, comprehending reader: 9 to 15 years old
[
edit
]
The goal of this stage is to "go below the surface of the text", and in the process the reader will build their knowledge of spelling substantially.
[134]
Teachers and parents may be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a child understands everything that they are reading. As the content of what they are able to read becomes more demanding, good readers will develop knowledge of
figurative language
and
irony
which helps them to discover new meanings in the text.
Children improve their comprehension when they use a variety of tools such as connecting prior knowledge, predicting outcomes, drawing inferences, and monitoring gaps in their understanding. One of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines.
When teaching comprehension, the
educational psychologist
,
G. Michael Pressley
, says a strong case can be made for instruction in decoding, vocabulary, word knowledge, active comprehension strategies, and self-monitoring.
[135]
At the end of this stage, many processes are starting to become automatic, allowing the reader to focus on meaning. With the decoding process almost automatic by this point, the brain learns to integrate more
metaphorical
, inferential,
analogical
, background and
experiential knowledge
. This stage in learning to read will often last until early adulthood.
[136]
Expert reader: 16 years and older
[
edit
]
At the expert stage it will usually only take a reader one-half second to read almost any word.
[137]
The degree to which expert reading will change over the course of an
adult's
life depends on what they read and how much they read.
Science of reading
[
edit
]
See also:
Evidence-based education
Writing is only about 5,500 years old, unlike
human speech
which is thought to be from 50,000 years to 2 million years old.
[138]
So, unlike speech, the brain did not evolve to read naturally. As a result, the brain adapts to the challenge of reading. The process of reading involves most of the brain, especially an interconnection between visual areas and language areas; but also neural systems related to action, emotion, decision making and memory.
[139]
[140]
There is no single definition of the science of reading (SOR).
[141]
Foundational skills such as
phonics
, decoding, and
phonemic awareness
are considered to be important parts of the science of reading, but they are not the only ingredients. SOR includes any
research and evidence
about how humans learn to read, and how reading should be taught. This includes areas such as oral reading fluency, vocabulary,
morphology
, reading comprehension, text, spelling and pronunciation, thinking strategies, oral language proficiency, working memory training, and written language performance (e.g., cohesion, sentence combining/reducing).
[142]
In addition, some educators feel that SOR should include digital literacy; background knowledge; content-rich instruction; infrastructural pillars (curriculum, reimagined teacher preparation, and leadership); adaptive teaching (recognizing the student's individual, culture and linguistic strengths); bi-literacy development; equity, social justice and supporting underserved populations (e.g., students from low-income backgrounds).
[141]
Some researchers suggest there is a need for more studies on the relationship between theory and practice. They say "we know more about the science of reading than about the science of teaching based on the science of reading", and "there are many layers between basic science findings and teacher implementation that must be traversed".
[141]
In cognitive science there is likely no area that has been more successful than the study of reading. Yet, in many countries reading levels are considered low. In the United States, the 2019
Nation's Report Card
reported that 34% of grade-four public school students performed at or above the
NAEP
proficient level
(solid academic performance) and 65% performed at or above the
basic level
(partial mastery of the proficient level skills).
[143]
As reported in the
PIRLS
study, the United States ranked 15th out of 50 countries, for reading comprehension levels of fourth-graders.
[63]
[64]
In addition, according to the 2011-2018
PIAAC
study, out of 39 countries the United States ranked 19th for literacy levels of adults 16 to 65; and 16.9% of adults in the United States read at or below level one (out of five levels).
[144]
[68]
Many researchers are concerned that low reading levels are due to the manner in which reading is taught. They point to three areas: a) contemporary reading science has had very little impact on educational practice mainly because of a "two-cultures problem separating science and education", b) current teaching practices rest on outdated assumptions that make learning to read harder than it needs to be, and c) connecting
evidence-based practice
to educational practice would be beneficial but is extremely difficult to achieve because many teachers are not properly trained in the science of reading.

Simple view of reading
[
edit
]
Main article:
Simple view of reading
The Simple View of Reading proposes four broad categories of developing readers: typical readers; poor readers; dyslexics; and hyperlexics.
The simple view of reading
is a scientific theory about reading comprehension.
[148]
According to the theory, in order to comprehend what they are reading students need both
decoding skills
and
oral language (listening) comprehension ability
. Neither is enough on their own. In other words, they need the ability to recognize and process (e.g., sound out) the text, and the ability to understand the language in which the text is written (i.e., vocabulary, grammar and background knowledge). Students are not reading if they can decode words but do not understand their meaning. Similarly, students are not reading if they cannot decode words that they would ordinarily recognize and understand if they heard them spoken out loud.
[149]
[150]
[151]
It is expressed in this equation:
Decoding × Oral Language Comprehension = Reading Comprehension.
[152]
As shown in the graphic, the Simple View of Reading proposes four broad categories of developing readers: typical readers; poor readers (general reading disability);
dyslexics
;
[153]
and
hyperlexics
.
[154]
[155]
Scarborough's reading rope
[
edit
]
Hollis Scarborough
, the creator of the Reading Rope and senior scientist at
Haskins Laboratories
, is a leading researcher of early language development and its connection to later literacy.
[156]
Scarborough published the Reading Rope infographics in 2001 using strands of rope to illustrate the many ingredients that are involved in becoming a skilled reader. The upper strands represent
language-comprehension
and reinforce one another. The lower strands represent
word-recognition
and work together as the reader becomes accurate, fluent, and automatic through practice. The upper and lower strands all weave together to produce a skilled reader.
[157]
Language-comprehension (Upper strands)
Background knowledge (facts, concepts, etc.)
Vocabulary (breadth, precision, links, etc.)
Language structures (syntax, semantics, etc.)
Verbal reasoning (inference, metaphor, etc.)
Literacy knowledge (print concepts, genres, etc.)
Word-recognition (Lower strands)
Phonological awareness (syllable, phonemes, etc.)
Decoding (alphabetic principle, spelling-sound correspondence)
Sight recognition (of familiar words)
More recent research by
Laurie E. Cutting
and Hollis S. Scarborough has highlighted the importance of
executive function
processes (e.g. working memory, planning, organization, self-monitoring, and similar abilities) to reading comprehension.
[158]
[159]
Easy texts do not require much executive functions; however, more difficult text require more "focus on the ideas".
Reading comprehension
strategies, such as summarizing, may help.
The active view of reading model
[
edit
]
The active view of reading (AVR) model (May 7, 2021), offers an alternative to the
Simple view of reading
(SVR), and a proposed update to
Scarborough's reading rope
(SRR). It reflects key insights from scientific research on reading that is not captured in the SVR and SRR. Although the AVR model has not been tested as a whole in research, "each element within the model has been tested in instructional research demonstrating positive, causal influences on reading comprehension".
[160]
This model is more complete than the simple view of reading and does a better job of accommodating some of the knowledge about reading that has been developed over the past several decades. However, it doesn't explain how these variables fit together, how their relative importance changes with development, or many other issues relevant to reading instruction.
[161]
The model lists contributors to reading (and potential causes of reading difficulty) - within, across, and beyond word recognition and language comprehension; including the elements of self-regulation. This feature of the model reflects the research documenting that not all profiles of reading difficulty are explained by low word recognition and/or low language comprehension. A second feature of the model is that it shows how word recognition and language comprehension overlap, and identifies processes that "bridge" these constructs.
The following chart shows the ingredients in the authors' infographic. In addition, the authors point out that reading is also impacted by text, task and
sociocultural context
.

Executive function skills
Strategy use (related to word recognition, comprehension, vocabulary, etc.)
Word recognition (WR)

[162]
How the brain reads
[
edit
]
Several researchers and neuroscientists have attempted to explain how the brain reads. They have written articles and books, and created websites and YouTube videos to help the average consumer.
[163]
[164]
[165]
[166]
Neuroscientist
Stanislas Dehaene
says that a few simple truths should be accepted by all, namely: a) all children have similar brains, are well tuned to systematic grapheme-phoneme correspondences, "and have everything to gain from phonics - the only method that will give them the freedom to read any text", b) classroom size is largely irrelevant if the proper teaching methods are used, c) it is essential to have standardized screening tests for
dyslexia
, followed by appropriate specialized training, and d) while decoding is essential, vocabulary enrichment is equally important.
[167]
A study conducted at the
Medical University of South Carolina
(MUSC) in 2022 indicates that "greater left-brain asymmetry can predict both better and average performance on a foundational level of reading ability, depending on whether analysis is conducted over the whole brain or in specific regions".
[168]
[169]
There have been correlations between specific brain regions in the
left hemisphere
of the
cerebral cortex
during different reading activities.
[170]
Although it is not included in most meta-analytical studies, the
sensorimotor cortex
of the brain is the most active region of the brain during reading. This is often disregarded because it is associated solely with movement;
[171]
however, a 2014 fMRI study involving adults and children participants, where bodily movement was restricted, demonstrated strong evidence revealing that this region may be correlated with automatic word processing and decoding.
[172]
The results of this study found this portion of the brain to be highly active in persons who were learning/struggling to read (children, those diagnosed with dyslexia, and those new to the English language) and less active in fluent adult readers.
[172]
The
occipital
and
parietal lobes
, or more specifically
fusiform gyrus
, include the brain's
visual word form area
(VWFA).
[173]
The VWFA is believed to be responsible for the brain's ability to read visually.
[173]
This area of the brain tends to be activated when words are presented orthographically, as found in a study in 2002 where participants were presented with word and non-word stimuli.
[174]
During presentation of word stimuli, this portion of the brain was extremely active; however, during presentation of stimuli that did not involve graphemes the brain was less active. Participants with dyslexia remained outliers, with this area of the brain being consistently under active in both scenarios.
[174]
The two major regions of the brain associated with phonological skills are the temporal-parietal region and the Perisylvian Region.
[175]
In an fMRI study conducted in 2001, participants were presented with written words, verbal frequency words, and verbal pseudo-words.
[176]
The dorsal (upper) portion of the temporal-parietal region was the most active during the pseudo-words and the ventral (lower) portion was more active during frequency words, with the exception of subjects diagnosed with dyslexia, who showed no impairment to their ventral region but under-activation in the dorsal portion.
[176]
The Perisylvian Region, which is the portion of the brain believed to connect Broca's and Wernicke's area,
[177]
is another region that is highly active during phonological activities where participants are asked to verbalize known and unknown words.
[178]
Damage to this portion of this brain directly affects a person's ability to speak cohesively and with sense; furthermore, this portion of the brain activity remains consistent for both dyslexic and non-dyslexic readers.
[179]
[178]
[180]
The inferior frontal region is a much more complex region of the brain, and its association with reading is not necessarily linear, for it is active in several reading related activities.
[181]
Several studies have recorded its activity in association with comprehension and processing skills, as well as spelling and working memory
[182]
Although the exact role of this portion of the brain is still debatable, several studies indicate that this area of the brain tends to be more active in readers who have been diagnosed with dyslexia and less active when treatment is successfully undergone.
[183]
In addition to regions on the cortex, which is considered
gray matter
on fMRI's, there are several
white matter
fasciculus that are also active during different reading activities.
[184]
These three regions are what connects the three respected cortex regions as the brain reads, thus it is responsible for the brains cross-model integration involved in reading.
[185]
Three connective fasciculus that are prominently active during reading are the following: the left
arcuate faciculus
, the left inferior longitudinal faciculus, and the
superior longitudinal fasciculus
.
[186]
All three areas are found to be weaker in readers diagnosed with dyslexia.
[184]
[185]
[186]
The
cerebellum
, which is not a part of the cerebral cortex, is also believed to play an important role in reading.
[187]
When the cerebellum is impaired, victims struggle with many executive functioning and organizational skills both inside and outside of their reading ability.
[187]
In a synthetic fMRI study, specific activities that displayed significant cerebellum involvement included automation, word accuracy, and reading speed.
[188]
Eye movement and silent reading rate
[
edit
]
Main article:
Eye movement in reading
Reading is an intensive process in which the eye quickly moves to assimilate the text - seeing just accurately enough to interpret groups of symbols.
[189]
It is necessary to understand
visual perception
and
eye movement in reading
to understand the reading process.
When reading, the eye moves continuously along a line of text, but makes short rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers, and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. When reading, the eye has a
perceptual span
of about 20 slots. In the best-case scenario and reading English, when the eye is fixated on a letter, four to five letters to the right and three to four letters to the left can be clearly identified. Beyond that, only the general shape of some letters can be identified.
[190]
The eye movements of deaf readers differ from that of readers that can hear, and skilled deaf readers have shown to have shorter fixations and fewer refixations when reading.
[191]
Research published in 2019 concluded that the
silent reading rate
of adults in English for
non-fiction
is in the range of 175 to 300
words per minute
(wpm); and for
fiction
the range is 200 to 320 words per minute.
[192]

Eye fixation point

Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud
[
edit
]
Main article:
Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud
In the early 1970s the
dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud
was proposed, according to which there are two separate mental mechanisms involved in reading aloud, with output from both contributing to the pronunciation of written words.
[195]
[196]
[197]
One mechanism is the
lexical
route whereby skilled readers can recognize a word as part of their
sight vocabulary
. The other is the
nonlexical or sublexical
route, in which the reader "sounds out" (decodes) written words.
[197]
[198]
The production effect (reading out loud)
[
edit
]
There is robust evidence that saying a word out loud makes it more memorable than simply reading it silently or hearing someone else say it. This is because self-reference and self-control over speaking produce more engagement with the words. The memory benefit of "hearing oneself" is referred to as
the production effect
.
[199]
This has implications for students such as those who are learning to read. The results of studies imply that oral production is beneficial because it entails two distinctive components: speaking (a motor act) and hearing oneself (the self-referential auditory input). It is also thought that the "optimal benefit would probably come from reading aloud from notes that the student took at the time of initial exposure to new information".

.
[233]
Other studies conclude that many children understand more from reading books vs. screens.
[234]
[235]
Apart from that, depending on the circumstances, some people prefer one medium over the other and each appears to have its own unique advantages.
[236]
Teacher training in science of reading
[
edit
]
According to some researchers, having a highly qualified teacher in every classroom is an educational necessity, and a 2023 study of 512 classroom teachers in 112 schools showed that teachers' knowledge of language and literacy reliably predicted students' reading foundational skills scores, but not reading comprehension scores.
[237]
Yet, some teachers, even after obtaining a master's degree in education, think they lack the necessary knowledge and skills to teach all students how to read.
[238]
A 2019 survey of K-2 and special education teachers found that only 11 percent said they felt "completely prepared" to teach early reading after finishing their preservice programs. And, a 2021 study found that most U.S. states do not measure teachers' knowledge of the 'science of reading'.
[239]
In addition, according to one study, as few as 2% of school districts use reading programs that follow the science of reading.

Mark Seidenberg
, a neuroscientist, states that, with few exceptions, teachers are not taught to teach reading and "don't know what they don't know".
[242]
A survey in the United States reported that 70% of teachers believe in a
balanced literacy
approach to teaching reading - however balanced literacy "is not systematic, explicit instruction".
[238]
Teacher, researcher and author, Louisa Moats,
[243]
in a video about teachers and science of reading, says that sometime, when teachers talk about their "philosophy" of teaching reading, she responds by saying, "But your 'philosophy' doesn't work".
[244]
She says this is evidenced by the fact that
so many children are struggling with reading
.
[245]
On another occasion, when asked what is the most frequent question teachers ask her, she replied, "over and over" they ask "why didn't anyone teach me this before?".
[246]
In an Education Week Research Center survey of more than 530 professors of reading instruction, only 22 percent said their philosophy of teaching early reading centered on explicit, systematic phonics with comprehension as a separate focus.
[238]
As of July 28, 2022, after
Mississippi
became the only state to improve reading results between 2017 and 2019,
[247]
30 U.S. states have since passed laws or implemented new policies related to evidence-based reading instruction.
[53]
These requirements relate to six areas: teacher preparation; teacher certification or license renewal; professional development or coaching; assessment; material; and instruction or intervention. As a result, many schools are moving away from balanced literacy programs that encourage students to guess a word, and are introducing phonics where they learn to "decode" (sound out) words.
[248]
However, the adoption of these new requirements are by no means uniform. For example, only five states have requirements in all six areas, and three have requirements in only one area. Also, only fourteen states have requirements related to teacher certification or license renewal, whereas 25 have requirements for professional development or coaching. Furthermore, eight states do not allow or require 3rd-grade retention for students who are behind in reading. Experts say it is uncertain whether these new initiatives will lead to real improvements in children's reading results because old practices prove hard to shake.
[249]
[250]
As more state legislatures seek to pass
science of reading
legislation, some teachers' unions are mounting opposition — citing concerns about mandates that would limit teachers' professional autonomy in the classroom, uneven implementation, unreasonable timelines, and the amount of time and compensation teachers receive for additional training.
[251]
Some teachers' unions, in particular, have protested attempts to ban the
three-cueing system
that encourages students to guess at the pronunciation of words, using pictures, etc. (rather than to decode them).
Arkansas
required every elementary and special education teacher to be proficient in the scientific research on reading by 2021; causing Amy Murdoch, an associate professor and the director of the reading science program at
Mount St. Joseph University
in Cincinnati to say "We still have a long way to go - but I do see some hope".

[252]
[253]
In 2021, the
Department of Education and Early Childhood Development
of
New Brunswick
appears to be the first in Canada to revise its K-2 reading curriculum based on "research-based instructional practice". For example, it replaced the various cueing systems with "mastery in the consolidated alphabetic to skilled reader phase".
[254]
[255]
Although one document on the site, dated 1998, contains references to such practices as using "cueing systems" which is at odds with the department's current shift to using evidence-based practices.
[256]
The Minister of Education in
Ontario
, Canada followed by stating plans to revise the elementary language curriculum and the Grade 9 English course with "scientific, evidence-based approaches that emphasize direct, explicit and systematic instruction and removing references to unscientific discovery and inquiry-based learning, including the three-cueing system, by 2023."
[257]
Some non-profit organizations, such as the Center for Development and Learning (
Louisiana
) and the Reading League (
New York State
), offer training programs for teachers to learn about the science of reading.

[231]
Timothy Shanahan
acknowledges that comprehensive research does not always exist for specific aspects of reading instruction. However, "the lack of evidence doesn't mean something doesn't work, only that we don't know". He suggests that teachers make use of the research that is available in such places as
Journal of Educational Psychology
,
Reading Research Quarterly
,
Reading & Writing Quarterly
,
Review of Educational Research
, and
Scientific Studies of Reading
. If a practice lacks supporting evidence, it can be used with the understanding that it is based upon a claim, not science.
[262]
Teaching reading
[
edit
]
Reading to children has many benefits; however, for most children it is not sufficient to teach them how to read. For that "all teaching should be initially focused on a single goal, the grasp of the alphabetic principle whereby each letter or grapheme represents a phoneme".
[263]
Alphabetic languages
[
edit
]
Educators have debated for years about which method is best to teach reading for the English language. There are three main methods,
phonics
,
whole language
and
balanced literacy
. There are also a variety of other areas and practices such as
phonemic awareness
, fluency, reading comprehension, sight words and sight vocabulary, the three-cueing system (the searchlights model in England),
guided reading
,
shared reading
, and
leveled reading
. Each practice is employed in different manners depending on the country and the specific school division.
In 2001, some researchers reached two conclusions: 1) "mastering the alphabetic principle is essential" and 2) "instructional techniques (namely, phonics) that teach this principle directly are more effective than those that do not". However, while they make it clear they have some fundamental disagreements with some of the claims made by whole-language advocates, some principles of whole language have value such as the need to ensure that students are enthusiastic about books and eager to learn to read.

Phonics and related areas
[
edit

Main article:
Phonics
A Course of Study in Phonics, San Francisco, U.S., 1912
[264]
Phonics
emphasizes the
alphabetic principle
- the idea that letters (
graphemes
) represent the sounds of speech (
phonemes
).
[265]
It is taught in a variety of ways; some are systematic and others are unsystematic. Unsystematic phonics teaches phonics on a "when needed" basis and in no particular sequence.
Systematic
phonics
uses a planned, sequential introduction of a set of phonic elements along with
explicit
teaching and practice of those elements. The
National Reading Panel
(NRP) concluded that systematic phonics instruction is more effective than unsystematic phonics or non-phonics instruction.
Phonics approaches include analogy phonics, analytic phonics, embedded phonics with mini-lessons, phonics through spelling, and synthetic phonics.
[266]
[267]
[268]
[71]
[269]
According to a 2018 review of research related to
English speaking poor readers
, phonics training is effective for improving literacy-related skills, particularly the fluent reading of words and non-words, and the accurate reading of irregular words.
[270]
In addition, phonics produces higher achievement for all beginning readers, and the greatest improvement is experienced by students who are at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instruction on phonics rules. Some phonics instruction has marked benefits such as expansion of a student's vocabulary. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.
[271]
A challenge in teaching phonics is that in some languages, such as English, complex letter-sound correspondences can cause confusion for beginning readers. For this reason, it is recommended that teachers of English-reading begin by introducing the "most frequent sounds" and the "common spellings", and save the less frequent sounds and complex spellings for later (e.g. the sounds /s/ and /t/ before /v/ and /w/; and the spellings c
a
ke before
eigh
t and
c
at before du
ck
).
[71]
[272]
[273]
Phonics is gaining
world-wide acceptance
.
Combining phonics with other literacy instruction
[
edit
]
Phonics is taught in many different ways and it is often taught together with some of the following: oral language skills,
[274]
[275]
concepts about print,
[276]
phonological awareness
,
phonemic awareness
,
phonology
, oral reading
fluency
, vocabulary,
syllables
,
reading comprehension
,
spelling
, word study,
[277]
[278]
[279]
cooperative learning
,
multisensory learning
, and
guided reading
. And, phonics is often featured in discussions about
science of reading
,
[280]
[281]
and
evidence-based practices
.
The
National Reading Panel
(U.S. 2000) is clear that "systematic phonics instruction should be integrated with other reading instruction to create a balanced reading program".
[282]
It suggests that phonics be taught together with phonemic awareness, oral fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.
Timothy Shanahan (educator)
, a member of that panel, recommends that primary students receive 60-90 minutes per day of explicit, systematic, literacy instruction time; and that it be divided equally between a) words and word parts (e.g. letters, sounds, decoding and phonemic awareness), b) oral reading fluency, c) reading comprehension, and d) writing.
[283]
Furthermore, he states that "the phonemic awareness skills found to give the greatest reading advantage to kindergarten and first-grade children are
segmenting and blending
".
[284]
The Ontario Association of Deans of Education (Canada) published research Monograph # 37 entitled
Supporting early language and literacy
with suggestions for parents and teachers in helping children prior to grade one. It covers the areas of letter names and letter-sound correspondence (phonics), as well as conversation, play-based learning, print, phonological awareness, shared reading, and vocabulary.
[285]
Effectiveness of programs
[
edit
]
Some researchers report that teaching reading without teaching phonics is harmful to large numbers of students; yet not all phonics teaching programs produce effective results. The reason is that the effectiveness of a program depends on using the right curriculum together with the appropriate approach to instruction techniques, classroom management, grouping, and other factors.
[286]
Louisa Moats, a teacher, psychologist and researcher, has long advocated for reading instruction that is direct, explicit and systematic, covering phoneme awareness, decoding, comprehension, literature appreciation, and daily exposure to a variety of texts.
[287]
She maintains that "reading failure can be prevented in all but a small percentage of children with serious learning disorders. It is possible to teach most students how to read if we start early and follow the significant body of research showing which practices are most effective".
[288]
Interest in
evidence-based education
appears to be growing.
[231]
In 2021,
Best evidence encyclopedia
(BEE) released a review of research on 51 different programs for struggling readers in elementary schools.
[208]
Many of the programs used phonics-based teaching and/or one or more of the following:
cooperative learning
, technology-supported adaptive instruction (see
Educational technology
),
metacognitive
skills,
phonemic awareness
, word reading,
fluency
,
vocabulary
,
multisensory learning
,
spelling
,
guided reading
,
reading comprehension
, word analysis, structured
curriculum
, and
balanced literacy
(non-phonetic approach).
The BEE review concludes that a) outcomes were positive for one-to-one tutoring, b) outcomes were positive, but not as large, for one-to-small group tutoring, c) there were no differences in outcomes between teachers and teaching assistants as tutors, d) technology-supported adaptive instruction did not have positive outcomes, e) whole-class approaches (mostly cooperative learning) and whole-school approaches incorporating tutoring obtained outcomes for struggling readers as large as those found for one- to-one tutoring, and benefitted many more students, and f) approaches mixing classroom and school improvements, with tutoring for the most
at-risk students
, have the greatest potential for the largest numbers of struggling readers.
[208]
Robert Slavin, of BEE, goes so far as to suggest that states should "hire thousands of tutors" to support students scoring far below grade level - particularly in elementary school reading. Research, he says, shows "only tutoring, both one-to-one and one-to-small group, in reading and mathematics, had an
effect size
larger than +0.10 ... averages are around +0.30", and "well-trained teaching assistants using structured tutoring materials or software can obtain outcomes as good as those obtained by certified teachers as tutors".
[289]
[290]
What works clearinghouse
allows you to see the effectiveness of specific programs. For example, as of 2020 they have data on 231 literacy programs. If you filter them by grade 1 only, all class types, all school types, all delivery methods, all program types, and all outcomes you receive 22 programs. You can then view the program details and, if you wish, compare one with another.

[210]
Systematic phonics
[
edit
]
The National Reading Panel concluded that systematic phonics instruction is more effective than unsystematic phonics or non-phonics instruction.
[293]
Systematic phonics
is not one specific method of teaching phonics; it is a term used to describe phonics approaches that are taught
explicitly
and in a structured, systematic manner. They are
systematic
because the letters and the sounds they relate to are taught in a specific sequence, as opposed to incidentally or on a "when needed" basis.
[294]
The
National Reading Panel
(NRP) concluded that systematic phonics instruction is more effective than unsystematic phonics or non-phonics instruction. The NRP also found that systematic phonics instruction is effective (with varying degrees) when delivered through one-to-one tutoring, small groups, and teaching classes of students; and is effective from kindergarten onward, the earlier the better. It helps significantly with word-reading skills and reading comprehension for kindergartners and 1st graders as well as for older struggling readers and reading disabled students. Benefits to spelling were positive for kindergartners and 1st graders but not for older students.
[295]
Systematic phonics is sometimes mischaracterised as "skill and drill" with little attention to meaning. However, researchers point out that this impression is false. Teachers can use engaging games or materials to teach letter-sound connections, and it can also be incorporated with the reading of meaningful text.
[296]
Phonics can be taught systematically in a variety of ways, such as: analogy phonics, analytic phonics, phonics through spelling, and synthetic phonics. However, their effectiveness vary considerably because the methods differ in such areas as the range of letter-sound coverage, the structure of the lesson plans, and the time devoted to specific instructions.
[297]
Systematic phonics has gained increased acceptance in different parts of the world since the completion of three major studies into teaching reading; one in the US in 2000,
[298]
[299]
another in Australia in 2005,
[300]
and the other in the UK in 2006.
[301]
In 2009, the UK
Department of Education
published a curriculum review that added support for systematic phonics. In fact, systematic phonics in the UK is known as
Synthetic phonics
.
[302]
Beginning as early as 2014, several states in the United States have changed their curriculum to include systematic phonics instruction in elementary school.
[303]
[304]
[305]
[306]
In 2018, the State
Government of Victoria
, Australia, published a website containing a comprehensive Literacy Teaching Toolkit including Effective Reading Instruction, Phonics, and Sample Phonics Lessons.
[307]
Analytic phonics and analogy phonics
[
edit
]
Main article:
Analytic phonics
Analytic phonics
does not involve pronouncing individual sounds (phonemes) in isolation and blending the sounds, as is done in synthetic phonics. Rather, it is taught at the word level and students learn to analyze letter-sound relationships once the word is identified. For example, students analyze letter-sound correspondences such as the
ou
spelling of
/
aʊ
/
in shr
ou
ds. Also, students might be asked to practice saying words with similar sounds such as
b
all,
b
at and
b
ite. Furthermore, students are taught consonant blends (separate, adjacent consonants) as units, such as
br
eak or
shr
ouds.
[308]
[309]
Analogy phonics
is a particular type of
analytic phonics
in which the teacher has students analyze phonic elements according to the speech sounds (
phonograms
) in the word. For example, a type of phonogram (known in linguistics as a
rime
) is composed of the vowel and the consonant sounds that follow it (e.g. in the words
cat, mat and sat,
the rime is
"at"
.) Teachers using the analogy method may have students memorize a bank of phonograms, such as
-at
or
-am
, or use
word families
(e.g. c
an
, r
an
, m
an
, or m
ay
, pl
ay
, s
ay
).
[310]
[308]
There have been studies on the effectiveness of instruction using analytic phonics vs. synthetic phonics. Johnston et al. (2012) conducted experimental research studies that tested the effectiveness of phonics learning instruction among 10-year-old boys and girls.
[311]
They used  comparative data from the Clackmannanshire Report and chose 393 participants to compare synthetic phonics instruction and analytic phonics instruction.
[312]
[311]
The boys taught by the synthetic phonics method had better word reading than the girls in their classes, and their spelling and reading comprehension was as good. On the other hand, with analytic phonics teaching, although the boys performed as well as the girls in word reading, they had inferior spelling and reading comprehension. Overall, the group taught by synthetic phonics had better word reading, spelling, and reading comprehension. And, synthetic phonics did not lead to any impairment in the reading of irregular words.
[311]
Embedded phonics with mini-lessons
[
edit
]
Embedded phonics
, also known as
incidental phonics
, is the type of phonics instruction used in
whole language
programs. It is not
systematic phonics
.
[313]
Although phonics skills are de-emphasised in whole language programs, some teachers include phonics "mini-lessons" when students struggle with words while reading from a book. Short lessons are included based on phonics elements the students are having trouble with, or on a new or difficult phonics pattern that appears in a class reading assignment. The focus on meaning is generally maintained, but the mini-lesson provides some time for focus on individual sounds and the letters that represent them. Embedded phonics is different from other methods because instruction is always in the context of literature rather than in separate lessons about distinct sounds and letters; and skills are taught when an opportunity arises, not systematically.
[314]
[315]
Phonics through spelling
[
edit
]
For some teachers this is a method of teaching spelling by using the sounds (phonemes).
[316]
However, it can also be a method of teaching reading by focusing on the sounds and their spelling (i.e. phonemes and syllables). It is taught systematically with guided lessons conducted in a direct and explicit manner including appropriate feedback. Sometimes
mnemonic
cards containing individual sounds are used to allow the student to practice saying the sounds that are related to a letter or letters (e.g.
a
,
e
,
i
,
o
,
u
). Accuracy comes first, followed by speed. The sounds may be grouped by categories such as vowels that sound short (e.g. c-
a
-t and s-
i
-t). When the student is comfortable recognizing and saying the sounds, the following steps might be followed: a) the tutor says a target word and the student repeats it out loud, b) the student writes down each individual sound (letter) until the word is completely spelled, saying each sound as it is written, and c) the student says the entire word out loud. An alternate method would be to have the student use mnemonic cards to sound-out (spell) the target word.
Typically, the instruction starts with sounds that have only one letter and simple CVC words such as
sat
and
pin
. Then it progresses to longer words, and sounds with more than one letter (e.g. h
ea
r and d
ay
), and perhaps even syllables (e.g. wa-ter). Sometimes the student practices by saying (or sounding-out) cards that contain entire words.
[317]
Synthetic phonics
[
edit
]
Main article:
Synthetic phonics
Synthetic phonics
, also known as blended phonics, is a systematic phonics method employed to teach students to read by
sounding out
the letters then
blending
the sounds to form the word. This method involves learning how letters or letter groups represent individual sounds, and that those sounds are blended to form a word. For example,
shrouds
would be read by pronouncing the sounds for each spelling,
sh, r, ou, d, s
(IPA
/
ʃ
,
r
,
aʊ
,
d
,
z
/
), then blending those sounds orally to produce a spoken word,
sh - r - ou - d - s = shrouds
(IPA
/
ʃ
r
aʊ
d
z
/
). The goal of a synthetic phonics instructional program is that students identify the sound-symbol correspondences and blend their phonemes automatically. Since 2005, synthetic phonics has become the accepted method of teaching reading (by phonics instruction) in England, Scotland and Australia.
[318]
[319]
[320]
[321]
The 2005
Rose Report
from the UK concluded that systematic
synthetic phonics
was the most effective method for teaching reading. It also suggests the "best teaching" included a brisk pace, engaging children's interest with
multi-sensory activities
and stimulating resources, praise for effort and achievement; and above all, the full backing of the headteacher.
[322]
It also has considerable support in some
States
in the U.S.
[299]
and some support from expert panels in
Canada
.
[323]
In the US, a pilot program using the Core Knowledge Early Literacy program that used this type of phonics approach showed significantly higher results in K-3 reading compared with comparison schools.
[324]
In addition, several States such as California, Ohio, New York and Arkansas, are promoting the principles of synthetic phonics (see
synthetic phonics in the United States
).
Resources for teaching phonics are available

Phonemic awareness
[
edit
]
Main article:
Phonemic awareness
Phonemic awareness
is the process by which the
phonemes
(sounds of oral language) are heard, interpreted, understood and manipulated - unrelated to their
grapheme
(written language). It is a sub-set of
Phonological awareness
that includes the manipulation of
rhymes
,
syllables
, and
onsets
and
rimes
, and is most prevalent in alphabetic systems.
[325]
The specific part of speech depends on the
writing system
employed. The
National Reading Panel
(NPR) concluded that phonemic awareness improves a learner's ability to learn to read. When teaching phonemic awareness, the NRP found that better results were obtained with focused and explicit instruction of one or two elements, over five or more hours, in small groups, and using the corresponding
graphemes
(letters).
[326]
See also
Speech perception
. As mentioned earlier, some researchers feel that the most effective way of teaching phonemic awareness is through segmenting and blending, a key part of
synthetic phonics
.
[284]
Vocabulary
[
edit
]
A critical aspect of reading comprehension is vocabulary development.
[327]
When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word if it is in the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of the word using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently then the development of reading will also be impaired.
[328]
Sight vocabulary vs. sight words
[
edit
]
Sight words
(i.e. high-frequency or common words), sometimes called the
look-say
or
whole-word method
, are
not
a part of the phonics method.
[329]
They are usually associated with
whole language
and
balanced literacy
where students are expected to memorize common words such as those on the
Dolch word list
and the Fry word list (e.g. a, be, call, do, eat, fall, gave, etc.).
[330]
[331]
The supposition (in whole language and balanced literacy) is that students will learn to read more easily if they memorize the most common words they will encounter, especially words that are not easily decoded (i.e. exceptions).
On the other hand, using sight words as a method of teaching reading in English is seen as being at odds with the
alphabetic principle
and treating English as though it was a
logographic
language (e.g.
Chinese
or
Japanese
).
[332]
In addition, according to research, whole-word memorization is "labor-intensive", requiring on average about 35 trials per word.
[333]
Also, phonics advocates say that most words are decodable, so comparatively few words have to be memorized. And because a child will over time encounter many low-frequency words, "the phonological recoding mechanism is a very powerful, indeed essential, mechanism throughout reading development".
[71]
Furthermore, researchers suggest that teachers who withhold phonics instruction to make it easier on children "are having the opposite effect" by making it harder for children to gain basic word-recognition skills. They suggest that learners should focus on understanding the principles of phonics so they can recognize the phonemic overlaps among words (e.g. have, had, has, having, haven't, etc.), making it easier to decode them all.
[334]
[335]
[336]
Sight vocabulary
is a part of the phonics method. It describes words that are stored in long-term memory and read automatically. Skilled fully-alphabetic readers learn to store words in long-term memory without memorization (i.e. a mental dictionary), making reading and comprehension easier. "Once you know the sound-based way to decode, your mind learns what words look like, even if you're not especially trying to do so".
[337]
The process, called
orthographic
mapping
, involves
decoding, crosschecking, mental marking and rereading
. It takes significantly less time than memorization. This process works for fully-alphabetic readers when reading simple decodable words from left to right through the word.
Irregular words
pose more of a challenge, yet research in 2018 concluded that "fully-alphabetic students" learn irregular words more easily when they use a process called
hierarchical decoding
. In this process, students, rather than decode from left to right, are taught to focus attention on the irregular elements such as a vowel-digraph and a silent-e; for example, break (b - r -
ea
- k), height (h -
eigh
- t), touch (t -
ou - ch
), and make (m -
a
- k
e
). Consequentially, they suggest that teachers and tutors should focus on "teaching decoding with more advanced vowel patterns before expecting young readers to tackle irregular words".
[333]
[338]
Fluency
[
edit
]
Main article:
Fluency
Fluency
is ability to read orally with speed, accuracy, and
vocal
expression. The ability to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult to remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to their background knowledge. This accuracy and
automaticity
of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.
[339]
Reading comprehension
[
edit
]
The NRP describes reading comprehension as a complex
cognitive
process in which a reader intentionally and interactively engages with the text. The
science of reading
says that reading comprehension is heavily dependent on word recognition (i.e., phonological awareness, decoding, etc.) and oral language comprehension (i.e., background knowledge, vocabulary, etc.).
[340]
Phonological awareness and rapid naming predict reading comprehension in second grade but oral language skills account for an additional 13.8% of the variance.
[341]
It has also been found that sustained content literacy intervention instruction that gradually build thematic connections may help young children transfer their knowledge to related topics, leading to improved comprehension.
[342]
The American educator,
Eric "E. D." Donald Hirsch Jr.
, suggests that students need to learn about something in order to read well.
[343]
However, some researchers say reading comprehension instruction has become "content agnostic", focused on skill practice (such as "finding the main idea"), to the detriment of learning about science, history, and other disciplines. Instead, they say teachers should find ways to integrate content knowledge with reading and writing instruction. One approach is to merge the two - to embed literacy instruction into social studies and science. Another approach is to build content knowledge into reading classes, often called "high-quality or "content-rich" curriculum.
[344]
[345]
However, according to
Natalie Wexler
, in her book
The Knowledge Gap
, "making the shift to knowledge is as much about changing teachers' beliefs and daily practice as about changing the materials they're supposed to use".
[346]
Reading and spelling (writing)
[
edit
]
Evidence supports the strong synergy between reading (decoding) and
spelling
(encoding), especially for children in kindergarten or grade one and elementary school students at risk for literacy difficulties. Students receiving encoding instruction and guided practice that included using (a) manipulatives such as letter tiles to learn phoneme-grapheme relationships and words and (b) writing phoneme-grapheme relationships and words made from these correspondences significantly outperformed contrast groups not receiving encoding instruction.

Whole language

Main article:
Whole language
Although widely used, whole-word methods are not supported by science.
[352]
[71]
Whole language
has the reputation of being a meaning-based method of teaching reading that emphasizes literature and text comprehension. It discourages any significant use of phonics, if at all.
[353]
Instead, it trains students to focus on words, sentences and paragraphs as a whole rather than letters and sounds. Students are taught to use context and pictures to "guess" words they do not recognize, or even just skip them and read on. It aims to make reading fun, yet many students struggle to figure out the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the student's decoding and spelling to suffer.
The following are some features of the whole language philosophy:
Children are expected to learn to read and write as they learned to talk, that is gradually, without a great deal of direct instruction. (However, researchers and neuroscientists say that learning to read, unlike learning to talk, is not a natural process and many learners require explicit instruction. They point out that millions of adults can speak their language just fine, yet they cannot read their language.)
[354]
[355]
[71]
Learning is emphasized more than teaching. It is assumed that the students will learn to read and write, and the teacher facilitates that growth.
Students read and write every day in a variety of situations.
Reading, writing, and spoken language are not considered separate components of the curriculum or merely ends in themselves; rather they permeate everything the students are doing.
There is no division between first
learning to read
and later
reading to learn
.
[356]
[357]
As of 2020, whole language is widely used in the US and Canada (often as
balanced literacy
); however, in some US States and many other
countries
, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, it has lost favor or been abandoned because it is not supported by evidence.
[358]
[359]
[360]
Some notable researchers have clearly stated their disapproval of
whole language
and
whole-word
teaching. In his 2009 book,
Reading in the brain
, cognitive neuroscientist,
Stanislas Dehaene
, said "cognitive psychology directly refutes any notion of teaching via a 'global' or 'whole language' method". He goes on to talk about "the myth of whole-word reading", saying it has been refuted by recent experiments. "We do not recognize a printed word through a holistic grasping of its contours, because our brain breaks it down into letters and graphemes".
[352]
In addition, cognitive neuroscientist
Mark Seidenberg
, in his 2017 book
Language at the speed of light
, refers to whole language as a "theoretical zombie" because it persists in spite of a lack of supporting evidence.
[361]
[362]
[358]
Balanced literacy
[
edit
]
Main article:
Balanced literacy
Balanced literacy
is not well defined; however, it is intended as a method that combines elements of both phonics and whole language.
[363]
According to a survey in 2010, 68% of elementary school teachers in the United States profess to use balanced literacy.
[364]
However, only 52% of teachers in the United States include
phonics
in their definition of
balanced literacy
.
The National Reading Panel concluded that phonics must be integrated with instruction in phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. And, some studies indicate that "the addition of language activities and tutoring to phonics produced larger effects than any of these components in isolation". They suggest that this may be a constructive way to view balanced reading instruction.
[365]
However, balanced literacy has received criticism from researchers and others suggesting that, in many instances, it is merely
whole language
by another name.
[366]
[367]
[368]
[369]
[370]
According to phonics advocate and cognitive neuroscientist
Mark Seidenberg
, balanced literacy allows educators to diffuse the
reading wars
while not making specific recommendations for change.
[271]
He goes on to say that, in his opinion, the high number of struggling readers in the United States is the result of the manner in which teachers are taught to teach reading.
[371]
[103]
[372]
[373]
He also says that struggling readers should not be encouraged to skip a challenging word, nor rely on pictures or semantic and syntactic cues to "guess at" a challenging word. Instead, they should use
evidence-based
decoding methods such as
systematic phonics
.
[374]
[375]
[376]
Structured Literacy
[
edit
]
Structured literacy has many of the elements of
systematic phonics
and few of the elements of balanced literacy.
[377]
It is defined as explicit, systematic teaching that focuses on phonological awareness, word recognition, phonics and decoding, spelling, and syntax at the sentence and paragraph levels. It is considered to be beneficial for all early literacy learners, especially those with
dyslexia
.
[378]
[379]
[380]
According to the
International Dyslexia Association
, structured literacy contains the elements of
phonology
and
phonemic awareness
, sound-symbol association (the
alphabetic principle
and
phonics
),
syllables
,
morphology
,
syntax
, and
semantics
. The elements are taught using methods that are systematic, cumulative, explicit,
multisensory
, and use diagnostic assessment.
[381]
Three cueing system (Searchlights model)
[
edit
]
The three-cueing system (the searchlights model in England) is a theory that has been circulating since the 1980s. Its roots are in the theories proposed in 1960s by
Ken Goodman
and
Marie Clay
that eventually became
whole language
,
reading recovery
and guided reading (e.g.,
Fountas and Pinnell
early reading programs).
[382]
As of 2010, 75% of teachers in the United States teach the three-cueing system.
[364]
It proposes that children who are stuck on a word should use various "cues" to figure it out and determine (guess) its meaning. The "meaning cues" are semantic ("does it make sense in the context?"), syntactic (is it a noun, verb, etc.?) and graphophonic (what are the letter-sound relationships?). It is also known as MSV (
M
eaning,
S
entence structure/syntax and
V
isual information such as the letters in the words).
According to some, three-cueing is not the most effective way for beginning readers to learn how to decode printed text.
[383]
While a cueing system does help students to "make better guesses", it does not help when the words become more sophisticated; and it reduces the amount of practice time available to learn essential decoding skills. They also say that students should first decode the word, "then they can use context to figure out the meaning of any word they don't understand".
Consequently, researchers such as cognitive neuroscientists
Mark Seidenberg
and professor
Timothy Shanahan
do not support the theory. They say the three-cueing system's value in reading instruction "is a magnificent work of the imagination", and it developed not because teachers lack integrity, commitment, motivation, sincerity, or intelligence, but because they "were poorly trained and advised" about the
science of reading
.
[384]
[385]
[386]
In England, the
simple view of reading
and
synthetic phonics
are intended to replace "the searchlights multi-cueing model".
[387]
[388]
On the other hand, some researchers suggest that "context" can be useful, not to guess a word, but to confirm a word after it has been phonetically decoded.
[141]
Three Ps (3Ps) - Pause Prompt Praise
[
edit
]
The three Ps approach is used by teachers, tutors and parents to guide oral reading practice with a struggling reader.
[389]
For some, it is merely a variation of the above-mentioned
three-cueing system
.
However, for others it is very different.
[390]
For example: when a student encounters a word they do not know or get it wrong, the three steps are: 1) pause to see if they can fix it themselves, even letting them read on a little, 2) prompt them with strategies to find the correct pronunciation, and 3) praise them directly and genuinely. In the
prompt
step, the tutor does not suggest the student skip the word or guess the word based on the pictures or the first sound. Instead, they encourage student to use their decoding training to sound out the word, and use the context (meaning) to confirm they have found the correct word.
Guided reading, reading workshop, shared reading, leveled reading, silent reading (and self-teaching)
[
edit
]
Guided reading
is small group reading instruction that is intended to allow for the differences in students' reading abilities.
[391]
While they are reading, students are encouraged to use strategies from the three-cueing system, the searchlights model, or MSV.
It is no longer supported by the
Primary National Strategy
in England as
Synthetic phonics
is the officially recognized method for teaching reading.
[392]
[393]
In the United States, Guided Reading is part of the Reading Workshop model of reading instruction.
[394]
The reading workshop model
provides students with a collection of books, allows them the choice of what to read, limits students' reading to texts that can be easily read by them, provides teaching through mini-lessons, and monitors and supports reading comprehension development through one-on-one teacher-student conferences. Some reports state that it is 'unlikely to lead to literacy success' for all students, particularly those lacking foundational skills.
[395]
[396]
Shared (oral) reading
is an activity whereby the teacher and students read from a shared text that is determined to be at the students' reading level.
Leveled reading
involves students reading from "leveled books" at an appropriate reading level. A student that struggles with a word is encouraged to use a cueing system (e.g. three-cueing, searchlights model or MSV) to guess its meaning. There are many systems that purport to gauge the students' reading levels using scales incorporating numbers, letters, colors and lexile readability scores.
[397]
Silent reading (and self-teaching)
is a common practice in elementary schools. A 2007 study in the United States found that, on average only 37% of class time was spent on active reading instruction or practice, and the most frequent activity was students reading silently. Based on the limited available studies on
silent reading
, the
NRP
concluded that independent silent reading did not prove an effective practice when used as the only type of reading instruction to develop fluency and other reading skills - particularly with students who have not yet developed critical alphabetic and word reading skills.
[398]
Other studies indicate that, unlike silent reading, "oral reading increases phonological effects".
According to some, the classroom method called DEAR (Drop everything and read) is not the best use of classroom time for students who are not yet fluent.
[399]
However, according to the
self-teaching hypothesis
, when fluent readers practice decoding words while reading silently, they learn what whole words look like (spelling), leading to improved fluency and comprehension.
[400]
[401]
The suggestion is: "if some students are fluent readers, they could read silently while the teacher works with the struggling readers".
Logographic languages
[
edit
]
Hieroglyph, one of the earliest forms of writing
Languages such as
Chinese
and Japanese are normally written (fully or partly) in
logograms
(
hanzi
and
kanji
, respectively), which represent a whole word or
morpheme
with a single character. There are a large number of characters, and the sound that each makes must be learned directly or from other characters which contain "hints" in them. For example, in Japanese, the
On-reading
of the kanji 民 is
min
and the related kanji 眠 shares the same On-reading,
min
: the right-hand part shows the character's pronunciation. However, this is not true for all characters.
Kun readings
, on the other hand, have to be learned and memorized as there is no way to tell from each character.
Ruby characters
are used in textbooks to help children learn the sounds that each logogram makes. These are written in a smaller size, using an alphabetic or
syllabic
script. For example,
hiragana
is typically used in Japanese, and the
pinyin
romanization
into Latin alphabet characters is used in Chinese.
漢
か
ん
字
じ
or
かん
じ
漢
字
The examples above each spell the word
kanji
, which is made up of two kanji characters: 漢 (
kan
, written in hiragana as かん), and 字 (
ji
, written in hiragana as じ).
Textbooks are sometimes edited as a cohesive set across grades so that children will not encounter characters they are not yet expected to have learned.
The Reading Wars: phonics vs. whole language
[
edit
]
A debate has been going on for decades about the merits of phonics vs.
whole language
. It is sometimes referred to as the
Reading Wars
.
[402]
[403]
Phonics was a popular way to learn reading in the 19th century.
William Holmes McGuffey
(1800-1873), an American educator, author, and Presbyterian minister who had a lifelong interest in teaching children, compiled the first four of the
McGuffey Readers
in 1836.
[404]
McGuffey's Primer 1836
Then, in 1841
Horace Mann
, the Secretary of the
Massachusetts Board of Education
, advocated for a whole-word method of teaching reading to replace phonics. Others, such as
Rudolf Flesch
, advocated for a return to phonics in his book
Why Johnny Can't Read
(1955). The whole-word method received support from
Kenneth J. Goodman
who wrote an article in 1967 entitled
Reading: A psycholinguistic guessing game
.
[405]
Although not supported by scientific studies, the theory became very influential as the
whole language
method.
[406]
[362]
Since the 1970s some whole language supporters such as
Frank Smith (psycholinguist)
, are unyielding in arguing that phonics should be taught little, if at all.
[407]
Yet, other researchers say instruction in phonics and
phonemic awareness
are "critically important" and "essential" to develop early reading skills.
[374]
[408]
[71]
In 2000, the
National Reading Panel
(U.S.) identified five ingredients of effective reading instruction, of which phonics is one; the other four are phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.
[97]
Reports from other countries, such as the Australian report on
Teaching reading
(2005)
[300]
and the U.K.
Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006)
have also supported the use of phonics.
Some notable researchers such as
Stanislas Dehaene
and
Mark Seidenberg
have clearly stated their disapproval of
whole language
.
[409]
[410]
Furthermore, a 2017 study in the UK that compared teaching with phonics vs. teaching whole written words concluded that phonics is more effective, saying "our findings suggest that interventions aiming to improve the accuracy of reading aloud and/or comprehension in the early stages of learning should focus on the systematicities present in print-to-sound relationships, rather than attempting to teach direct access to the meanings of whole written words".
[411]
More recently, some educators have advocated for the theory of
balanced literacy
purported to combine phonics and whole language yet not necessarily in a consistent or systematic manner. It may include elements such as word study and phonics mini-lessons, differentiated learning, cueing, leveled reading, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading and sight words.
[412]
[413]
[414]
[415]
According to a survey in 2010, 68% of K-2 teachers in the United States practice balanced literacy; however, only 52% of teachers included
phonics
in their definition of
balanced literacy
. In addition, 75% of teachers teach the
three-cueing system
(i.e., meaning/structure/visual or semantic/syntactic/graphophonic) that has its roots in whole language.
[364]
[416]
In addition, some phonics supporters assert that
balanced literacy
is merely
whole language
by another name.
[417]
And critics of whole language and sceptics of balanced literacy, such as neuroscientist
Mark Seidenberg
, state that struggling readers should
not
be encouraged to skip words they find puzzling or rely on semantic and syntactic cues to guess words.
[374]
[368]
[418]
Over time a growing number of countries and states have put greater emphasis on phonics and other
evidence-based practices
(see
Phonics practices by country or region
).
Requirements for proficient reading
[
edit
]
According to the report by the US
National Reading Panel
(NRP) in 2000,
[97]
[419]
the elements required for proficient reading of
alphabetic
languages are
phonemic awareness
,
phonics
,
fluency
,
[339]
vocabulary
,
[327]
and
text comprehension
. In non-Latin languages, proficient reading does not necessarily require
phonemic awareness
, but rather an awareness of the individual parts of speech, which may also include the whole word (as in Chinese characters) or syllables (as in Japanese) as well as others depending on the writing system being employed.
The
Rose Report
, from the
Department for Education
in England makes it clear that, in their view,
systematic phonics
, specifically
synthetic phonics
, is the best way to ensure that children learn to read; such that it is now the law.
[301]
[420]
[421]
[422]
In 2005 the government of
Australia
published a report stating "The evidence is clear ... that direct systematic instruction in phonics during the early years of schooling is an essential foundation for teaching children to read".
[423]
Phonics has been gaining acceptance in many other countries as can be seen from this page
Practices by country or region
.
Other important elements are:
rapid automatized naming
(RAN),
[424]
[425]
a general understanding of the
orthography
of the language, and practice.
Rapid automatized naming
, the ability to say quickly the names of letters, objects and colors, predicts an individual's ability to read. This might be linked to the importance of quick retrieval of
phonological
representations from
long-term memory
in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left
cerebral hemisphere
that are recruited to underpin a learner's word-recognition abilities.
[424]
[425]
Orthography
describes or defines the set of symbols used in a language, and the rules about how to write these symbols (i.e., the conventional spelling system of a language). Orthographic Development proceeds in increasing complexity as a person learns to read. Some of the first things to be learnt are the orthographic conventions such as the direction of reading and that there are differing typefaces and capitalization for each symbol. In general, this means that to read proficiently, the reader has to understand elements of a written language. In the United States, a limited amount of spelling is taught up to grade four, and beyond that "we gain orthographic expertise by reading"; so the amount and variety of texts that children read is important.
[426]
Practice: Repeated exposure to print improves many aspects of learning to read and most importantly the knowledge of individual words. It increases the speed at which high frequency words are recognized which allows for increased
fluency
in reading. It also supports orthographic development,
reading comprehension
and
vocabulary development
. Research suggests there is value in reading words both in isolation and in context. Reading words in isolation promotes faster reading times and better memory for spellings; whereas, reading words in context improves semantic knowledge and comprehension.
[427]
Reading difficulties
[
edit
]
Difficulties in reading typically involve difficulty with one or more of the following: decoding, reading rate, reading fluency, or reading comprehension.
Decoding
[
edit
]
Main article:
Dyslexia
Brain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation.
[428]
Difficulty with decoding is marked by having not acquired the
phoneme
-
grapheme
mapping concept. One specific disability characterized by poor decoding is
dyslexia
, defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.
[429]
These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia. Although the symptoms vary from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding.
[429]
Adults can have either developmental dyslexia
[430]
[431]
[432]
[433]
or
acquired dyslexia
which occurs after a
brain injury
,
stroke
[434]
[435]
or
dementia
.
[436]
[437]
[431]
[432]
[434]
[435]
Reading rate
[
edit
]
Average reading rate in
words per minute
(wpm) depending on age and measured with different tests in English, French and German
Individuals with reading rate difficulties tend to have accurate word recognition and normal comprehension abilities, but their reading speed is below grade level.
[438]
Strategies such as
guided reading
(guided, repeated oral-reading instruction), may help improve a reader's reading rate.
[439]
Many studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension.
[440]
Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces).
[441]
Scientific studies have demonstrated that
speed reading
- defined here as capturing and decoding words faster than 900 wpm - is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.
[442]
Reading fluency
[
edit
]
Individuals with reading fluency difficulties fail to maintain a fluid, smooth pace when reading. Strategies used for overcoming reading rate difficulties are also useful in addressing reading fluency issues.
[419]
Reading comprehension
[
edit
]
Main article:
Reading comprehension
Individuals with
reading comprehension
difficulties are commonly described as poor comprehenders.
[443]
They have normal decoding skills as well as a fluid rate of reading, but have difficulty comprehending text when reading. The
simple view of reading
holds that reading comprehension requires both
decoding skills
and
oral language comprehension
ability.
[155]
Increasing vocabulary knowledge, listening skills and teaching basic comprehension techniques may help facilitate better reading comprehension. It is suggested that students receive brief, explicit instruction in reading comprehension strategies in the areas of vocabulary, noticing understanding, and connecting ideas.
[444]
Scarborough's Reading Rope
and
The active view of reading model
also outline some of the essential ingredients of reading comprehension.
Radio Reading Service
[
edit
]
In some countries, a
radio reading service
provides a service for
blind
people and others who chose to hear
newspapers
, books, and other printed material read aloud, typically by volunteers. An example is
Australia
's
Radio Print Handicapped Network
with stations in capital cities and some other areas.
Reading achievement: national and international reports
[
edit
]
The following organizations measure and report on reading achievement in the United States and internationally:
NAEP
[
edit
]
Main article:
NAEP
In the United States, the National Assessment of Educational Progress or
NAEP
("The Nation's Report Card") is the national assessment of what students know and can do in various subjects. Four of these subjects - reading, writing, mathematics and science - are assessed most frequently and reported at the state and district level, usually for grades 4 and 8.
[445]
In 2019, with respect to the reading skills of the nation's grade-four public school students, 35% performed at or above the NAEP
Proficient level
(solid academic performance) and 65% performed at or above the NAEP
Basic level
(partial mastery of the proficient level skills). It is believed that students who read below the basic level do not have sufficient support to complete their schoolwork.
[446]
Reading scores for the individual States and Districts are available on the NAEP site. Between 2017 and 2019
Mississippi
was the only State that had a grade-four reading score increase and 17 States had a score decrease.
[447]
The
COVID-19 pandemic
had a significant impact on reading results in the United States. In 2022 the average basic-level reading score among elementary schoolchildren was 3 points lower compared to 2019 (the previous assessment year) and roughly equivalent to the first reading assessment in 1992. Students of all ethnic groups other than Asians saw their scores decline. However, "black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) students and students in high-poverty schools were disproportionately impacted". (This was substantiated by other sources).
[448]
In 2022, no states had a reading score increase and 30 states had a score decrease.
[449]
The results by race or ethnicity were as follows:

[451]
The average reading score for grade-four public school students was 219.
[452]
Female students had an average score that was 7 points higher than male students. Students who were eligible for the
National School Lunch Program (NSLP)
had an average score that was 28 points lower than that for students who were not eligible.
PIAAC
[

Main article:
PIAAC
The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (
PIAAC
) is an international study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (
OECD
) of cognitive and workplace skills in 39 countries between 2011 and 2018.
[67]
The Survey measures adults' proficiency in key information-processing skills - literacy, numeracy and problem solving. The focus is on the working-age population between the ages of 16 and 65. For example, the study shows the ranking of 38 countries as to the
literacy proficiency among adults
. According to the 2019 OECD report, the five countries with the highest ranking are Japan, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Australia; whereas Canada is 12th, England (UK) is 16th, and the United States is 19th.
[144]
It is also worth noting that the PIAAC table A2.1 (2013) shows the percentage of adults reading
at-or-below level one
(out of five levels). Some examples are Japan 4.9%, Finland 10.6%, Netherlands 11.7%, Australia 12.6%, Sweden 13.3%, Canada 16.4%, England 16.4%, and the United States 16.9%.
[68]
PIRLS
[
edit
]
Main article:
PIRLS
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (
PIRLS
) is an international study of reading (comprehension) achievement in fourth graders.
[62]
It is designed to measure children's reading literacy achievement, to provide a baseline for future studies of trends in achievement, and to gather information about children's home and school experiences in learning to read. The 2016 PIRLS report shows the 4th grade reading achievement by country in two categories (literary and informational). The ten countries with the highest overall reading average are the Russian Federation, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Finland, Poland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Chinese Taipei and England (UK). Some others are: the United States 15th, Australia 21st, Canada 23rd, and New Zealand 33rd.

PISA
[
edit
]
Main article:
PISA
The Programme for International Student Assessment (
PISA
) measures 15-year-old school pupils scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.
[66]
In 2018, of the 79 participating countries/economies, on average, students in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang (China) and Singapore outperformed students from all other countries in reading, mathematics and science. 21 countries have reading scores above the OECD average scores and many of the scores are not statistically different.
[453]
[454]
Critics, however, say PISA is fundamentally flawed in its underlying view of education, its implementation, and its interpretation and impact on education globally.
[455]
In 2014, more than 100 academics from around the world called for a moratorium on PISA.
[456]
[457]
According to a 2023 book, PISA is failing in its mission. It suggests that flatlined student outcomes and policy shortcomings have much to do with PISA's implicit ideological biases, structural impediments such as union advocacy, and conflicts of interest.

, is an agency of the government of Ontario, Canada that reports on the publicly funded school system.
[459]
In 2022, it reported that 77% of grade three students in Ontario's English language schools met the provincial standard in reading in 2018-2019. This decreased to 73% in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.
[460]
53% of grade three students with special needs met the standard in 2018-2019, and this reduced to 48% in 2021-2022. 72% of grade three students who are English language learners met the standard in 2018-2019, and this reduced to 67% in 2021-2022.

History of reading
[

A
Catholic monk

The history of reading dates back to the
invention of writing
during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading
print
text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With
some exceptions
, only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered
literate
before the
Industrial Revolution
. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included
classical Athens
and the Islamic
Caliphate
.
[462]
Scholars assume that reading aloud (Latin
clare legere
) was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (
legere tacite
or
legere sibi
) was unusual.
[463]
In his
Confessions
,
Saint Augustine
remarks on
Saint Ambrose
's unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.
[463]
[464]
During the
Age of Enlightenment
, elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society - and viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made.
[465]
Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product.
Michel de Certeau
argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era.
[465]
Before the mid 18th century, children's books in England usually had religious or instructional (school books, conduct books) themes, but by the mid to late 18th century books were designed to delight and novels would come into popularity. By the end of the 18th century literature made for children were flourishing, with perhaps as many as 50 books being printed every year in major cities.
[466]
In 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one - and as sleeping increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers - especially women - could escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.
[467]
Also during the 18th century in England, reading novels was often criticized as a time-wasting pastime, when contrasted with the cultural seriousness carried by reading history, classical literature or poetry.
[468]
Chapbooks
were small, cheap forms of literature for children and adults that were sold on the streets, and covered a range of subjects such as ghost stories, crime, fantasy, politics and disaster updates. They provided simple reading matter and were commonplace across England from the 17th to the 19th century. They are known to have been passed down the generations. Their readership would have been largely among the poor, and among children of the middle class.
[469]
Reading became even more pronounced in the 19th century with public notes, broadsides, catchpennies and printed songs becoming common street literature, it informed and entertained the public before newspapers became readily available. Advertisements and local news, such as offers of rewards for catching criminals or for the return of stolen goods, appeared on public notices and handbills, while cheaply printed sheets - broadsheets and ballads - covered political or criminal news such murders, trials, executions, disasters and rescues.
[470]
Technological improvements during the industrial revolution in printing and paper production; and new distribution networks enabled by improved roads and rail helped push an increased demand for printed (reading) matter. Besides this, social and educational changes (such as wider schooling rates) along with increasing literacy rates, particularly among the middle and working classes, helped boost a new mass market for printed material.
[471]
The arrival of gas and electric lighting in private homes meant that reading after dark no longer had to take place by oil lamp or candlelight.
[468]
In 19th century
Russia
, reading practices were highly varied, as people from a wide range of social statuses read Russian and foreign-language texts ranging from high literature to the peasant
lubok
.
[472]
Provincial readers such as Andrei Chikhachev give evidence of the omnivorous appetite for fiction and non-fiction alike among middling landowners.
[473]
History of learning to read
[
edit
]
The history of learning to read dates back to the
invention of writing
during the 4th millennium BC.
[474]
With respect to the English language in the United States, the
phonics
principle of teaching reading was first presented by
John Hart
in 1570, who suggested the teaching of reading should focus on the relationship between what is now referred to as
graphemes
(letters) and
phonemes
(sounds).
[475]
In the
colonial times
of the United States, reading material was not written specifically for children, so instruction material consisted primarily of the Bible and some patriotic essays. The most influential early textbook was
The New England Primer
, published in 1687. There was little consideration given to the best ways to teach reading or assess reading comprehension.
[476]
[477]
Phonics was a popular way to learn reading in the 1800s.
William Holmes McGuffey
(1800-1873), an American educator, author, and Presbyterian minister who had a lifelong interest in teaching children, compiled the first four of the
McGuffey Readers
in 1836.
[404]
The whole-word method was introduced into the English-speaking world by
Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet
, the director of the
American School for the Deaf
.
[478]
It was designed to educate deaf people by placing a word alongside a picture.
[479]
In 1830, Gallaudet described his method of teaching children to recognize a total of 50 sight words written on cards.
[480]
[481]
Horace Mann
, the Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts, U.S., favored the method for everyone, and by 1837 the method was adopted by the
Boston
Primary School Committee.
[482]
By 1844 the defects of the whole-word method became so apparent to Boston schoolmasters that they urged the Board to return to phonics.
[483]
In 1929,
Samuel Orton
, a
neuropathologist
in
Iowa
, concluded that the cause of children's reading problems was the new
sight method
of reading. His findings were published in the February 1929 issue of the
Journal of Educational Psychology
in the article "The Sight Reading Method of Teaching Reading as a Source of Reading Disability".
[484]
The meaning-based curriculum came to dominate reading instruction by the second quarter of the 20th century. In the 1930s and 1940s, reading programs became very focused on comprehension and taught children to read whole words by sight. Phonics was taught as a last resort.
[476]
Edward William Dolch
developed his list of
sight words
in 1936 by studying the most frequently occurring words in children's books of that era. Children are encouraged to memorize the words with the idea that it will help them read more fluently. Many teachers continue to use this list, although some researchers consider the theory of sight word reading to be a "myth". Researchers and literacy organizations suggest it would be more effective if students learned the words using a phonics approach.
[352]
[485]
[486]
In 1955,
Rudolf Flesch
published a book entitled
Why Johnny Can't Read
, a passionate argument in favor of teaching children to read using phonics, adding to the reading debate among educators, researchers, and parents.
[487]
An American girl reading a newspaper (1969)
Government-funded research on reading instruction in the United States and elsewhere began in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing studies with evidence on the effectiveness of different instructional approaches. During this time, researchers at the
National Institutes of Health
(NIH) conducted studies that showed early reading acquisition depends on the understanding of the connection between sounds and letters (i.e. phonics). However, this appears to have had little effect on educational practices in public schools.
[488]
[489]
In the 1970s, the
whole language
method was introduced. This method de-emphasizes the teaching of phonics out of context (e.g. reading books), and is intended to help readers "guess" the right word.
[490]
It teaches that guessing individual words should involve three systems (letter clues, meaning clues from context, and the syntactical structure of the sentence). It became the primary method of reading instruction in the 1980s and 1990s. However, it is falling out of favor. The neuroscientist
Mark Seidenberg
refers to it as a "theoretical zombie" because it persists in spite of a lack of supporting evidence.
[410]
[360]
It is still widely practiced in related methods such as
sight words
, the
three-cueing system
and
balanced literacy
.
[491]
[488]
[492]
In the 1980s the
three-cueing system
(the searchlights model in England) emerged. According to a 2010 survey 75% of teachers in the United States teach the three-cueing system.
[364]
It teaches children to guess a word by using "meaning cues" (semantic, syntactic and graphophonic). While the system does help students to "make better guesses", it does not help when the words become more sophisticated; and it reduces the amount of practice time available to learn essential decoding skills. Consequently, present-day researchers such as cognitive neuroscientists
Mark Seidenberg
and professor
Timothy Shanahan
do not support the theory.
[384]
[385]
[386]
In England,
synthetic phonics
is intended to replace "the searchlights multi-cueing model".
[387]
[388]
In the 1990s
Balanced literacy
arose. It is a theory of teaching reading and writing that is not clearly defined. It may include elements such as word study and phonics mini-lessons, differentiated learning, cueing, leveled reading, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading and sight words.
[412]
[413]
[414]
[415]
For some, balanced literacy strikes a balance between
whole language
and
phonics
. Others say balanced literacy in practice usually means the
whole language
approach to reading.
[493]
According to a survey in 2010, 68% of K-2 teachers in the United States practice balanced literacy. Furthermore, only 52% of teachers included
phonics
in their definition of
balanced literacy
.
[364]
In 1996 the
California
Department of Education took an increased interest in using phonics in schools.
[494]
And in 1997 the department called for grade one teaching in concepts about print, phonemic awareness, decoding and word recognition, and vocabulary and concept development.
[495]
By 1998 in the U.K. whole language instruction and the searchlights-model were still the norm; however, there was some attention to teaching phonics in the early grades, as seen in the National Literacy Strategies.
[496]
[497]
21st century

In 2000 the
National Reading Panel
in the U.S. identified five ingredients of effective reading instruction:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension
.
Beginning in 2000, several reading research reports were published:
2000 - The
National Reading Panel
(U.S.) that identified five ingredients of effective reading instruction:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension
.
[97]
2005 - The
Australian
report on
Teaching reading
that supports the use of
systematic phonics
.
[300]
2006 - The
United Kingdom
Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006)
that supports
systematic synthetic phonics
.
[498]
In Australia the 2005 report,
Teaching Reading
, recommends teaching reading based on evidence and teaching systematic, explicit phonics within an integrated approach.
[499]
[500]
The executive summary says "
systematic phonics
instruction is critical if children are to be taught to read well, whether or not they experience reading difficulties".
[423]
As of October 5, 2018
, The State Government of Victoria, Australia, publishes a website containing a comprehensive Literacy Teaching Toolkit including effective reading instruction, phonics, and sample phonics lessons.
[501]
[502]
In
Scotland
a seven-year study (the Clackmannanshire Report) was published in 2005.
[503]
It compared analytic phonics with synthetic phonics and advantaged students with disadvantaged students. The report found that, using
synthetic phonics
children from lower socio-economic backgrounds performed at the same level as children from advantaged backgrounds in primary school (whereas with analytic phonics teaching, they did significantly less well.); and boys performed better than or as well as girls.
[312]
A five-year follow-up of the study concluded that the beneficial effects were long-lasting, in fact the reading gains increased.
[504]
Subsequently,
Education Scotland
concluded that explicit, systematic phonics programs, usually embedded in a rich literacy environment, give an additional four months progress over other programs such as whole language, and are particularly beneficial for young learners (aged 4-7). There is evidence, though less secure, that synthetic phonics programs may be more beneficial than
analytic phonics
programs; however, it is most important to teach
systematically
.
[505]
Until 2006, the English language syllabus of
Singapore
advocated "a balance between decoding and meaning-based instruction … phonics and whole language". However, a review in 2006 advocated for a "systematic" approach. Subsequently, the syllabus in 2010 had no mention of whole language and advocated for a balance between "systematic and explicit instruction" and "a rich language environment". It called for increased instruction in oral language skills together with phonemic awareness and the key decoding elements of synthetic phonics, analytic phonics and analogy phonics.
[506]
In 2007 the Department of Education (DE) in
Northern Ireland
was required by law to teach children foundational skills in
phonological awareness
and the understanding that "words are made up of sounds and syllables and that sounds are represented by letters (phoneme/grapheme awareness)".
[507]
In 2010 the DE required that teachers receive support in using
evidence-based practices
to teach literacy and numeracy, including: a "systematic programme of high-quality phonics" that is explicit, structured, well-paced, interactive, engaging, and applied in a meaningful context.
[508]
In 2008, the
National Center for Family Literacy
, with the
National Institute for Literacy
,
[509]
published a report entitled
Developing Early Literacy
. It is a synthesis of the scientific research on the development of early literacy skills in children ages zero to five as determined by the
National Early Literacy Panel
that was convened in 2002. Amongst other things, the report concluded that code-focused interventions on the early literacy and conventional literacy skills of young children yield a moderate to large effect on the predictors of later reading and writing, irrespective of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or population density.
[510]
In 2010 the
Common Core State Standards Initiative
was introduced in the United States. The
English Language Arts Standards for Reading: Foundational Skills in Grades 1-5
include recommendations to teach print concepts, phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, and fluency.
[511]
In the United Kingdom a 2010 government white paper contained plans to train all primary school teachers in phonics.
[512]
The 2013 curriculum
[513]
has "statutory requirements" that, amongst other things, students in years one and two be capable in using
systematic synthetic phonics
in regards to word reading, reading comprehension, fluency, and writing. This includes having skills in "sound to graphemes", "decoding", and "blending".
[421]
[422]
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
In 2013, the National Commission for
UNESCO
launched the
Leading for Literacy
project to develop the literacy skills of grades 1 and 2 students. The project facilitates the training of primary school teachers in the use of a
synthetic phonics
program. From 2013 to 2015, the
Trinidad and Tobago
Ministry of Education appointed seven reading specialist to help primary and secondary school teachers improve their literacy instruction. From February 2014 to January 2016, literacy coaches were hired in selected primary schools to assist teachers of kindergarten, grades 1 and 2 with pedagogy and content of early literacy instruction. Primary schools have been provided with literacy resources for instruction, including phonemic awareness, word recognition, vocabulary manipulatives, phonics and comprehension.
In 2013 the
State of Mississippi
passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act.
[514]
[515]
The
Mississippi Department of Education
provided resources for teachers in the areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension and reading strategies.
[516]
[517]
[447]
The school curriculum in
Ireland
focuses on ensuring children are literate in both the
English language
and the
Irish language
. The 2014 teachers' Professional Development guide
[518]
covers the seven areas of attitude and motivation, fluency, comprehension, word identification, vocabulary, phonological awareness, phonics, and assessment. It recommends that phonics be taught in a systematic and structured way and is preceded by training in phonological awareness.
In 2014 the
California
Department of Education said children should know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade, and be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)".
[519]
In grades two and three children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.
[520]
In 2015 the
New York State
Public School system revised its English Language Arts learning standards, calling for teaching involving "reading or literacy experiences" as well as
phonemic awareness
from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition for grades 1-4.
[521]
That same year, the
Ohio
Legislature set minimum standards requiring the use of phonics including guidelines for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.
[522]
[523]
[524]
In 2016 the What Works Clearinghouse
[216]
and the
Institute of Education Sciences
published an Educator's Practice Guide on Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten Through 3rd Grade.
[525]
It contains four recommendations to support reading: 1) teach students academic language skills, including the use of inferential and narrative language, and vocabulary knowledge, 2) develop awareness of the segments of sounds in speech and how they link to letters (phonemic awareness and phonics), 3) teach students to decode words, analyze word parts, and write and recognize words (phonics and synthetic phonics), and 4) ensure that each student reads connected text every day to support reading accuracy, fluency, and comprehension.
[526]
[527]
In 2016 the
Colorado Department of Education
updated their
Elementary Teacher Literacy Standards
with standards for development in the areas of phonology, phonics and word recognition, fluent automatic reading, vocabulary, text comprehension, handwriting, spelling, and written expression.
[528]
At the same time, the Department of Education in
Delaware
produced a plan to improve education results. It states that "students who aren't reading at grade level aren't able to comprehend up to half of the printed fourth-grade curriculum". Furthermore, it says a gap exists between what is known about how to teach reading and how teachers are able to teach reading. It goes on to say that teachers' preparation programs must include evidence-based practices, including the five essential components of reading instruction (phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension).
[529]
The European Literacy Policy Network (ELINET) 2016
[530]
reports that
Hungarian
children in grades one and two receive explicit instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics "as the route to decode words". In grades three and four they continue to apply their knowledge of phonics; however, the emphasis shifts to the more meaning-focused technical aspects of reading and writing (i.e., vocabulary, types of texts, reading strategies, spelling, punctuation and grammar).
[531]
In 2017 the
Ohio
Department of Education adopted
Reading Standards for Foundational Skills K-12
laying out a systematic approach to teaching
phonological awareness
in kindergarten and grade one, and
grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words
(including fluency and comprehension) in grades 1-5.
[81]
In 2018 the
Arkansas Department of Education
published a report about their new initiative known as R.I.S.E., Reading Initiative for Student Excellence, that was the result of The Right to Read Act, passed in 2017.
[252]
The first goal of this initiative is to provide educators with the in-depth knowledge and skills of "the science of reading" and evidence-based instructional strategies.
[532]
This included a focus on research-based instruction on phonological awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension; specifically systematic and explicit instruction.
[533]
[534]
As of 2018
, the Ministry of Education in New Zealand has online information to help teachers to support their students in years 1-3 in relation to sounds, letters, and words. It states that phonics instruction "is not an end in itself" and it is
not
necessary to teach students "every combination of letters and sounds".
[535]
In 2018, ScienceDirect published the results of a study of early literacy and numeracy outcomes in developing countries entitled
Identifying the essential ingredients to literacy and numeracy improvement: Teacher professional development and coaching, student textbooks, and structured teachers' guides
.
[536]
It concluded that "Including teachers' guides was by far the most cost-effective intervention".
There has been a strong debate in France on the teaching of phonics ("méthode syllabique") versus whole language ("méthode globale"). After the 1990s, supporters of the later started defending a so-called "mixed method" (also known as
Balanced literacy
) in which approaches from both methods are used. Influential researchers in psycho-pedagogy, cognitive sciences and neurosciences, such as
Stanislas Dehaene
[163]
and
Michel Fayol
have put their heavy scientific weight on the side of phonics. In 2018 the ministry created a science educational council that openly supported phonics.
[537]
[538]
In April 2018, the minister issued a set of four guiding documents
[539]
for early teaching of reading and mathematics and a booklet
[540]
detailing phonics recommendations. Some have described his stance as "traditionalist",
[541]
but he openly declared that the so-called mixed approach is no serious choice.
[542]
In 2019 the
Minnesota Department of Education
introduced standards requiring school districts to "develop a local literacy plan to ensure that all students have achieved early reading proficiency by no later than the end of third grade" in accordance with a Statute of the
Minnesota Legislature
requiring elementary teachers to be able to implement comprehensive,
scientifically based reading
and oral language instruction in the five reading areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
[543]
[544]
Also in 2019, 26% of grade 4 students in
Louisiana
were reading at the
proficiency level
according to the
Nation's Report Card
, as compared to the National Average of 34%.
[545]
In March 2019 the
Louisiana Department of Education
revised their curriculum for K-12 English Language Arts including requirements for instruction in the alphabetic principle, phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, fluency and comprehension.
[546]
[547]
And again in 2019, 30% of grade 4 students in
Texas
were reading at the
proficiency level
according to the
Nation's Report Card
.
[545]
[548]
[452]
In June of that year the Texas Legislature passed a Bill requiring all kindergarten through grade-three teachers and principals to "
begin
a teacher literacy achievement academy before the 2022-2023 school year".
[549]
The required content of the academies' training includes the areas of
The Science of Teaching Reading, Oral Language, Phonological Awareness, Decoding (i.e. Phonics), Fluency and Comprehension.
The goal is to "increase teacher knowledge and implementation of
evidence-based practices
to positively impact student literacy achievement".
[550]
In 2021, the State of Connecticut passed an act concerning the "right to read" that will take effect in 2023. It requires education standards that are
evidenced-based
and scientifically based and focused on competency in the five areas of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and reading fluency, including oral skills and reading comprehension.
[551]
In the same year, the state of North Carolina passed a bill requiring that the teaching of reading be based on the
science of reading
.
[552]
In Canada, on January 27, 2022, the
Ontario Human Rights Commission
(OHRC) released a report on its public inquiry into the right to read.
[553]
It followed the unanimous decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada
, on November 9, 2012, recognizing that learning to read is not a privilege, but a basic and essential human right.
[554]
The OHRC's report deals with all students, not just those with learning disabilities.
[555]
The inquiry found that Ontario is not fulfilling its obligations to meet students' right to read. Specifically, foundational word-reading skills are not effectively targeted in Ontario's education system. With science-based approaches to reading instruction, early screening and intervention, we should see only about 5% of students reading below grade level. However, in 2018-2019, 26% of all Ontario Grade 3 students and 53% of Grade 3 students with special education needs (students who have an Individual Education Plan), were not meeting the provincial EQAO standard. The results improved only slightly for Grade 6 students, where 19% of all students and 47% of students with special education needs did not meet the provincial standard.
The Ontario curriculum encourages the use of the
three-cueing system
and
balanced literacy
, which are ineffective because they teach children to "guess" the meaning of a word rather than sound it out. What is required is a)
evidence-based curriculum and instruction
(including explicit and systematic instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics), b) evidence-based screening assessments, c) evidence-based reading interventions, d) accommodations that are not used as a substitute for teaching students to read, and e) professional assessments (yet, not required for interventions or accommodations).
The Minister of Education for Ontario
responded to this report by saying the government is taking immediate action to improve student literacy and making longer-term reforms to modernize the way reading is taught and assessed in schools, with a focus on phonics. Their plan includes "revising the elementary Language curriculum and the Grade 9 English course with scientific, evidence-based approaches that emphasize direct, explicit and
systematic instruction
, and removing references to unscientific discovery and inquiry-based learning, including the three-cueing system, by 2023."
[556]
On April 23, 2022, the Center for Research in Education and Social Policy at the
University of Delaware
presented the results of a study of the long-term effects of
Reading Recovery
. The conclusion was that the "long-term impact estimates were significant and negative". The study found that children who received Reading Recovery had scores on state reading tests in third and fourth grade that were below the test scores of similar children who did not receive Reading Recovery. It suggests three possible hypotheses for this outcome: 1) while Reading Recovery produces large impacts on early literacy measures, it does not give students the required skills for success in later grades; or, 2) the gains are lost because students do not receive sufficient intervention in later grades; or, 3) the impacts of the early intervention was washed out by subsequent experiences.
[557]
[558]
Between 2013 and 2022, 30 States have passed laws or implemented new policies related to evidence-based reading instruction.

Other terms
[

Subvocalization
is the sense that a reader is combining silent reading with internal sounding of the words. Advocates of speed reading claim it can be a bad habit that slows reading and comprehension, but some researchers say this is a fallacy since there is no actual speaking involved. Instead, it may help skilled readers to read since they are utilizing the phonological code to understand words (
e.g.
, the difference between
PERmit
and
perMIT
).
[559]
[560]
[561]
Speed reading
is the claim that you can increase reading speed without experiencing an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. Methods include skimming or the
chunking
of words in a body of text to increase the rate of reading. However, cognitive neuroscientists such as
Stanislas Dehaene
and
Mark Seidenberg
say that claims of reading up to 1,000 words per minute 'must be viewed with skepticism' and that 'people are as likely to read thousands of words per minute as they are to run faster than the speed of light'".
[352]
[562]
It is estimated that the average reading speed for adults in English is from 175 to 320 words per minute.
[192]
Proofreading
is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting
typographical errors
. It is not reading in the usual sense, as they may largely suspend comprehension while doing so.
[563]
Rereading
is reading a book more than once. "One cannot read a book: one can only reread it,"
Vladimir Nabokov
once said.
[564]
Structure-proposition-evaluation (SPE)
method, popularized by
Mortimer Adler
in
How to Read a Book
, mainly for non-fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three passes: 1) for the structure of the work, 2) for the logical propositions made, and 3) for evaluation of the merits of the arguments and conclusions. This method involves
suspending judgment

[1]
The
siege of Montauban
(French: siège de Montauban) was a siege conducted by the young French king
Louis XIII
from August to November 1621, against the Protestant stronghold of
Montauban
. This siege followed the
siege of Saint-Jean-d'Angély
, in which Louis XIII had succeeded against Rohan's brother
Benjamin de Rohan, duc de Soubise
.
[2]
Despite a strength of about 25,000 men,
[3]
Louis XIII was unable to capture the city of Montauban, and he had to raise the siege and abandon it after 2 months.
[4]
After a lull, Louis XIII resumed his campaign with the
siege of Montpellier
, which ended in stalemate, leading to the 1622
Peace of Montpellier
, which temporarily confirmed the right of the Huguenots in France.
[5]
The city would be finally captured in 1629, in the
Redition of Montauban
.

Director
Paweł Skibiński
Website
The
Museum of John Paul II and Primate Wyszyński
(
Polish
:
Muzeum Jana Pawła II i Prymasa Wyszyńskiego
) is a
Roman Catholic
cultural and educational institution affiliated with the
Archdiocese of Warsaw
, honoring two prominent Polish Catholic leaders:
Saint John Paul II
, the first Polish
Pope
, and Cardinal
Stefan Wyszyński
, the
Archbishop of Warsaw and Gniezno and Primate of Poland
. It was established by a decree
[1]
of 18 May 2010 issued by Archbishop
Kazimierz Nycz
.
The museum is located at the
Temple of Divine Providence
, which constitutes its integral part. The museum’s exhibition space, which was under construction as of 2014
, is housed 26 metres (85 ft) above ground in the area surrounding the dome of the Church.
Mission
[
edit
]
The Museum of John Paul II and Primate Wyszyński recognizes their contribution to Polish culture and preserves the memory of their resistance against the Nazi and communist totalitarian systems, which in the 20th century had exterminated many Polish citizens and attempted to overrun Poland's cultural identity. The museum was also commissioned to commemorate the role of the Catholic Church in Polish culture and society in the 20th century.
The Narrative Museum will be a time vehicle. The use of multimedia, decorations and sound effects is intended to take the visitor through a course of events and invite them to co-participate in the men's history.
[
when?
]
Project
[
edit
]
The main exhibition covers the period from 1901, the year Stefan Wyszyński was born, to 2005, the year John Paul II died.
The main exhibition was designed by the Kłaput Project (Barbara and Jarosław Kłaputowie).
The main exhibition
[
edit
]
The main exhibition will consist of ten zones to highlight specific historical events. Four events of the twentieth century symbolize moments of special unity between the Polish nation and the Catholic Church: the Millennium of the Baptism of Poland in 1966; the first papal Mass conducted at Victory Square in Warsaw in June 1979; the
Solidarity (Polish trade union)
of 1980; and the Great Jubilee of the year 2000.
