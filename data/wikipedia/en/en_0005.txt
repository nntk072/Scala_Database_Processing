(

Yuri
(
Korean

), is a South Korean pop singer. Debuting as a singer with
Cool
(쿨), she later formed
Girl Friends
with best friend
Chae Ri-na
after the former group's breakup in 2005. Yuri has since regrouped with
Cool
.
Career
[
edit
]
Yuri was not an original member of Cool, but was brought in to replace
Yoo Chae-yeong
for the group's second album.
[2]
The band's lineup stayed the same from the second album onwards.
[3]
In 2004, though, Cool was reportedly in danger of breaking up due to tensions within the band.
[4]
The group eventually broke up after the release of their tenth album in 2005.
[5]
A year after the breakup, Yuri announced that she would be joining with close friend Chae Ri-na to become a musical duo, named Girl Friends.
[6]
Becoming friends in the 1990s while performing with their respective groups, the two had been discussing a possible joint project for 10 years.
[7]
Girl Friends released their first album,
Another Myself
, in 2006, with the lead single "Maybe I Love You".
[8]
Their second album,
Addict 2 Times
, was released in late 2007.
[9]
In 2008, Cool announced that they would be regrouping.
[10]
Yuri stated that she missed performing their trademark dance songs in the summer, even while still performing as part of Girl Friends.
[11]
The group then released their 11th album in the summer of 2009.
[12]
Yuri has set up an online shopping mall with friend
Baek Ji-young
.
[13]
On October 17, 2012, it was reported that Yuri had been accidentally killed in a fight in Gangnam, Seoul, but this was revealed to be a case of mistaken identity. The real victim was "Ms. Kang", the ex-wife of Yuri's Cool bandmate Kim Sung Soo, who was stabbed to death in a fight in a restaurant where she had been meeting with
Roo'ra
and
Girl Friends
singer Chae Ri-na. "Ms. Kang" and Yuri were supposedly very physically similar, causing a misunderstanding as to the identity of the victim.

Joint Service Signal Unit, Cyprus
Ayios Nikolaos Station
(also spelled
Agios Nikolaos
;
Greek
:
Άγιος Νικόλαος
, lit. "Saint Nicholas") is a British military station and part of in the
British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia
in
Cyprus
.  It is a former village (
Ayios Nikolaos, SBA
) connected by a road to the main area of the Dhekelia Garrison. The Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus) (JSSU(Cyp)), formerly 9th Signal Regiment and the
Royal Air Force
's 33 Signals Unit, is based at Ayios Nikolaos. This unit is a
British Armed Forces
run
electronic intelligence
gathering station.
[1]
The current superior body to JSSU (Cyp) appears to be the Joint Service Signal Organisation.
[2]
The JSSO, as of 2012, was located at
RAF Digby
in
Lincolnshire
, under the command of a
Group Captain
of the RAF Operations Support Branch and had 1,600 staff which are drawn from all three services.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
The station was established at Ayios Nikolaos shortly after the
Second World War
.
[4]
In 1946 2 Wireless Company and 2 Special Wireless Group merged to become 2 Wireless Regiment RSigs. In 1959 2 Wireless Regiment became 9 Signal Regiment.
[5]
In early 1956 No. 751 Signals Unit RAF, a mobile radar convoy, was located at RAF Ayios Nikolaos. The unit radars initially comprised one Type 15, two Type 14s, and two Type 13s, conducting air defence.
[6]
It moved to
Cape Greco
after March 1956.
[7]
It was located there until 1959.
[8]
There were a number of court cases involving servicemen from the regiment during the 1980s, including the
Cyprus Seven Trial
, an alleged spy-ring operating at Ayios Nikolaos Station in 1984.
[9]
The Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus) (or JSSU (Cyp)) was formed on 1 April 1999, as a result of the amalgamation of the Joint Service Signal Unit (Ayios Nikolaos) and elements of 33 Signals Unit RAF.
[10]
It is a three-squadron organisation, commanded by a
Royal Signals
Lieutenant Colonel, with a number of
Royal Air Force
and civilian contractors attached.
Ayios Nikolaos
or
Agios Nikolaos
is a very common place name in
Greece
and
Cyprus
; it is Greek for "
Saint Nicholas
".
[11]
For satellite interception, the Ayios Nikolaos station has a number of dish antennas of various sizes. Somewhere between 2008 and 2011, also a
torus antenna
was installed, which is able to receive the signals of up to 35 satellites simultaneously.
[12]
Declassified documents show that the station was run for the
Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ), and
documents released by Edward Snowden
suggest that in recent years half the cost of running the station is funded by the U.S.
National Security Agency
.
[13]
It became the largest GCHQ site outside the UK.

One of the many famous boats that made Port Owen their home
Port Owen
is a man-made
marina
in the town of
Velddrif
, 145 km from
Cape Town
, on the west coast of
Western Cape Province
,
South Africa
. Velddrif, which has incorporated the village of Laaiplek has the lowest crime statistics in South Africa according to the local police station. It comprises 100 hectares and has 3.5 km of waterways which were produced over 15 years of dredging to remove roughly a million tons of dredge.
The marina is surrounded on three sides by the
Great Berg River
and is 1km from the harbour mouth, where the river meets St. Helena Bay. This bay, the largest on the west coast of Africa, offers the finest sailing conditions on the South African coastline because of its sheltered nature and its orientation to the prevailing summer wind (The South-East Trade, which blows off-shore here). That has been confirmed by Bertie Reed, John Martin, Dave Hudson and many other leading South African sailors.
In 1497,
Vasco da Gama
landed here and recorded, "The dogs here sound just like the ones in Portugal". A monument was later erected on the shore by the Portuguese government.
The marina is adjacent to the fishing harbour of Laaiplek and is surrounded by salt marsh. The area is renowned for its bird life and for the over 350 different sea, land and river birds that are found here.
Port Owen is named after H. Owen Wiggins Junior, who recognising the potential for a Florida-style residential marina developed the marshy farm land, creating its residential and commercial plots and all the infrastructure.  He also established the Port Owen Yacht Club, which grew from Friday evening sundowners on his advertising manager Gideon Langart's 36' yacht,
Absolutely!
to a large and thriving club.
The original plan set aside the Marina Centre, which has become the commercial centre of Port Owen. The Harbour Centre shopping centre has a health spa, pub, restaurant, hairdressing salon, cafe, fishing tackle shop and estate agency. Adjacent is a brewery, distillery and restaurant. Owen Wiggins went on to create the Langebaan Country Club.
Port Owen was the first deep-sea residential marina developed in South Africa. The waterways are controlled by the Port Owen Marina Authority.
[1]
For many years, it was the home of
Roamer
, Bob Burn's boat on which he became the 32nd man to sail around the world single-handedly. Its bell is on display at Gideon Estates.
Port Owen is surrounded on three sides by the
Berg River
, which limits its future growth and ensures that it remains restful and exclusive. In the heart of Port Owen is Admiral Island, a privately run security estate that is accessible only by the entry-controlled bridge or from the water. The shoreline of Admiral Island is monitored by 24-hour-monitored security cameras and rapid-response armed security. The lifestyle on Admiral Island is very relaxed and secure as can be seen from the boats and equipment in the yards of unfenced houses.

Port Owen has a slipway, three restaurants, a microbrewery a gin distillery and shops. The river is navigable for 56 km for shallow-drought boats.

The
World's Largest Disco
is an annual event held at the
Buffalo Niagara Convention Center
in
Buffalo, New York
each year the Saturday after
Thanksgiving
. The event, widely popular in the area, is a tribute to the
disco
era and features live performances by 1970s-era musicians, along with dancers dressed in 1970s attire; it also bills itself as "the greatest
people watching
event on Earth."
The current event began as an annual occurrence in 1994, but it traces its history and name to a disco held in Buffalo in 1979, featuring
The Trammps
and
Gloria Gaynor
. That disco is marked in
Guinness World Records
as the largest disco in the history, with 13,000 people in attendance. The current incarnation of the event draws 7,000, though this is only because of capacity issues; ticket sales were capped at 7,000 after the 1997 event also drew over 13,000 fans, well over the convention center's capacity. Tickets for the event regularly sell out within minutes of being put on sale, which usually occurs in early August.
The in-person event was not held in 2020 due to crowd size limits imposed during the
COVID-19 pandemic in New York (state)
. A radio broadcast on
WTSS
, which will break from the station's usual
Christmas music
format, coincided with an Internet stream on the World's Largest Disco Web site featuring replays of video from past events. The in-person event will return in 2021, with a capacity reduced to 6,500.
The event is a charity fundraiser held by Conesus Fest for Charity to raise funds for
Camp Good Days and Special Times
, a summer camp for children with cancer.

Part of the foundation's innovative work involves extensive overland travel to discover the health and human rights issues in a region, seeking formal and informal organizations that are successfully dealing with these problems and their cultural context. The foundation then implements a pilot program involving as many of these players as possible and then presents the findings at the
International AIDS Conference

English society
comprises the
group behaviour
of the
English people
, and of collective social interactions, organisation and political attitudes in
England
. The
social history of England
evidences many social and societal changes over the
history of England
, from
Anglo-Saxon England
to the contemporary forces upon the
Western world
. These major social changes have occurred both internally and in its relationship with other nations. The themes of
social history
include
demographic history
,
labour history and the working class
,
women's history
,
family
, the
history of education in England
,
rural and agricultural history
,
urban history
and
industrialisation

Prehistoric society
[
edit
]
The distant past does not offer much information on the structures of society. However, major changes in human behaviour make it likely that society must have changed dramatically. In common with much of
Europe
, the switch from the
hunter-gatherer
lifestyle to
farming
around 4000 BC must have heralded an enormous shift in all aspects of human life. Nobody knows what changes may have occurred, and recent evidence of permanent buildings and habitation from 3,000 years ago means that these may still have been gradual shifts. One of the most obvious symbols of change in prehistoric society is
Stonehenge
. The building of such
stone circles
,
burial mounds
and
monuments
throughout the
British Isles
seems to have required a
division of labour
. Builders would have needed to dedicate themselves to the task of monument construction to acquire the necessary skills. Not having time to hunt and farm would make them rely on others to such an extent that specialised farmers would emerge who provided not only for themselves but also for the monument builders. There are many changes in culture seen in prehistoric and later times such as the
Beaker people
, the
Celts
, the
Romans
and the
Anglo-Saxons
.

Roman Britain
The
Roman invasion of Britain
in 54 BC probably did not alter society greatly at first, as it was simply a replacement of the ruling class, but numerous, at first minor, ideas would later gain footholds. Certainly, it would not have affected
Ireland
in the slightest. It is from the Romans, and particularly
Tacitus
, that we get the earliest detailed written records of Britain and its tribal society. We get fascinating glimpses of society in Britain before the Romans, although only briefly and disparagingly mentioned, particularly the importance of powerful women such as
Cartimandua
and
Boudica
. City dwelling was not new to pre-Roman Britain, but it was a lifestyle that the Romans preferred even though available to only a select few Romanised Britons. Romanisation was an important part of the Roman conquest strategy, and British rulers who willingly adopted Roman ways were rewarded as client kings; a good example of this is
Togidubnus
and his ultramodern
Fishbourne Roman Palace
. To subdue and control the country, the Romans built a major road network which not only was an important
civil engineering
project but formed the basis of the country's communication links. The Romans brought many other innovations and ideas such as writing and plumbing, but how many of these things were the preserve of the rich or were even lost and re-appropriated at a later date is uncertain.

History of Anglo-Saxon England
The collapse of the
Western Roman Empire
in the 5th century is thought to have brought general strife and anarchy to society, but the actual events are not well understood.
Archaeology
certainly shows a reduction in the expensive goods found before, and the Roman cities began to be abandoned, but much of British society had never had such things. Certainly, numerous peoples took advantage of the absence of Roman power, but how they affected British society is far from clear. The hegemony of Roman rule gave way to a selection of splintered, often competing, societies, including later the
heptarchy
. Rather than think of themselves as a small part of a larger Roman empire, they reverted to smaller tribal allegiances.
The
Anglo-Saxons
' arrival is the most hotly disputed of events, and the extent to which they killed, displaced, or integrated with the existing society is still questioned.
[3]
What is clear is that a separate Anglo-Saxon society, which would eventually become
England
with a more
Germanic
feel, was set up in the south east of the island. These new arrivals had not been conquered by the Romans, but their society was perhaps similar to that of Britain. The main difference was their
pagan
religion, which the surviving northern areas of non-Saxon rule sought to convert to Christianity. During the 7th century these northern areas, particularly
Northumbria
, became important sites of learning, with
monasteries
acting like early schools and intellectuals such as
Bede
being influential. In the 9th century
Alfred the Great
worked to promote a literate, educated people and did much to promote the
English language
, even writing books himself. Alfred and his successors unified and brought stability to most of the south of Britain that would eventually become England.
[4]
Late medieval society
[

See also:
England in the High Middle Ages
and
England in the Late Middle Ages
The medieval English saw their economy as comprising three groups - the clergy, who prayed; the
knights
, who fought; and the
peasants
, who worked the land. The monasteries and the nobility owned most of the land, but some rich peasants also owned land.
After the
Norman conquest
of England in 1066, society seemed fixed and unchanging for several centuries, but gradual and significant changes were still taking place, the exact nature of which would not be appreciated until much later. The Norman lords spoke
Norman French
, and in order to work for them or gain advantage, the English had to use the
Anglo-Norman language
that developed in England. This became a necessary administrative and literary language (see
Anglo-Norman literature
), but despite this the English language was not supplanted, and after gaining much in grammar and vocabulary began in turn to replace the language of the rulers. At the same time the population of England more than doubled between Domesday and the end of the 13th century, and this growth was not checked by the almost continual foreign warfare, crusades and occasional civil anarchy.
[5]
Feudalism
, although historians debate the term, is often used to describe medieval society.
[6]
Basically stated, a lord owns land or a
fief
which he allows
vassals
to work in return for their military service. The vast majority of the people were
peasants
who would work on the vassal's fiefs. This or a similar system was the basis of later medieval society. It probably existed in some form in England before the Norman conquest, but the
Normans
did much to institute it, either replacing existing lords or by becoming 'overlords' above now-demoted lords. A wealth of information on these social structures can be drawn from the best early surveys of its type, the
Domesday Book
.
[7]
Church
[
edit
]
See also:
Religion in Medieval England
The Crusades
are one measure of the ever-increasing power of the church in medieval life, with some estimates suggesting that as many as 40,000 clergy were ordained during the 13th century. This is also shown by the spate of
cathedral
building, common throughout Europe, at the time. These great buildings would often take several generations to complete, spawning whole communities of artisans and craftsmen and offering them jobs for life.
[8]
A quarter of the land was owned by the Church. Its monasteries owned large tracts of land farmed by peasants.
[9]
Prosperity and population growth
[
edit
]
See also:
Economy of England in the Middle Ages
The two centuries from 1200 to 1400 (when the plague hit) were prosperous. The population grew rapidly, from about 2 million to about 5 million. England remained a mainly rural society, and many agricultural changes, such as
crop rotation
, kept the countryside profitable. Most people lived by farming, although there were wide variations in patterns of land ownership and the status of peasants. To meet the needs of the growing population more land had to be cultivated. Waste land was exploited and major incursions were made into forests, fen and marsh lands. "High farming" was increasingly practised, whereby the landowner took personal control of his land using hired hands rather than leasing it out. Treatises appeared on the best practices, but the growth of per-acre productivity was small. On good land one acre might produce 17 bushels of wheat (compared to 73 bushels an acre in the 1960s), or 26 of barley or 22 of oats.
[10]
[11]
After 1300 prosperity was more tenuous owing to a combination of over-population, land shortages and depleted soils.  The loss of life in the
Great Famine of 1315-1317
shook the English economy severely, and population growth ceased.
[12]
The first outbreak of the
Black Death
in 1348 then killed around half the English population, but left plenty of land for the survivors. The agricultural sector shrank, with higher wages, lower prices and shrinking profits leading to the final demise of the old
demesne
system and the advent of the modern farming system of cash rents for lands.
[13]
Wat Tyler's
Peasants' Revolt
of 1381 shook the older feudal order and limited the levels of royal taxation considerably for a century to come.
[14]
Towns
[
edit
]
The increase in population led not only to denser rural areas but also to more and larger towns. Many new towns appeared but most were small. Major cities such as
Lincoln
,
Norwich
and
Thetford
had 4,000-5,000 population, while London grew from 10,000 to nearly 40,000 population and York approached 10,000.
[15]
The 13th century experienced a mini-industrial revolution, with the increased use of
wind power
and changes in the
wool
industry. Wool, always important to the British economy, was traditionally exported to be processed, but it was now frequently processed in England, creating a variety of extra jobs. The export of cloth continued to increase from the 14th century onwards, and after the closing of the port of
Calais
(which consumed much of the raw wool) by
the Spanish
in the late 16th century, cloth became the primary type of wool exported.
[16]
Many people were finding different roles and responsibilities within English society too, with the growth of
common law
giving people greater access to the law and the "commons" starting to have a place in the Parliament during
Edward I of England
's time.
Black Death and population decline
[
edit
]
The Black Death re-shaped society; the "dance of death" was a favourite visual image; no one knew who would die and who would live.
After many years of growth and gradual change, there was one seismic event which changed British society dramatically. The
Black Death
in the middle of the 14th century almost halved the population. Whole villages were wiped out by the plague, but rather than destroying society it managed to reinvigorate it. Before the plague there was a large, probably excessive, workforce with not enough productive work available. Overpopulation meant that before the Black Death too many people were competing for scarce resources. Afterwards, the drop in population meant that labourers were in short supply and were paid better. Peasants who had once been confined to a landowner's estate now had an incentive to travel to areas without workers. This social mobility was combined with the fact that peasants could charge much more for their services, and this began a switch from
indentured labourer
to
wage
earner, which signalled the decline of the feudal system.
[17]
The peasants' new-found freedoms were very worrying to the authorities, who passed laws specifying the maximum that a peasant should be paid, but this had little effect on wages. The first of several
sumptuary laws
were also made, dictating exactly how people at every level of society should dress and what they could own, in an effort to enforce social distinctions. These new laws, plus a newly levied
poll tax
which had been calculated on pre-plague population figures, led directly to the
Peasants' Revolt
. Although quickly put down, the revolt was an early popular reform movement—a precursor to later, more successful uprisings.
[18]
Chaucer's vision
[
edit
]
Geofrey Chaucer
's
Canterbury Tales
give an illuminating picture of many of the different people who made up medieval society, although these portraits are limited mainly to the middle classes. The
Wife of Bath
is one particularly vibrant character within the Tales, and a few years later a real-world equivalent,
Margery Kempe
, showed in her autobiography that women had an important part in medieval society.
[19]
Tudor society
[
edit
]
See also:
Tudor period
and
Elizabethan era
In general terms, the
Tudor dynasty
period was seen as relatively stable compared to the previous years of almost constant warfare. However, the
Reformation
caused internal and external social conflict, with a considerable impact on social structure and personality.
[20]

Before they were broken up and sold by
Henry VIII
,
monasteries
had been one of the important parts of social welfare, giving
alms
and looking after the destitute, and their disappearance meant that the state would have to adopt this role, which culminated in the
Poor Law
of 1601. The monasteries were decrepit and no longer were the major educational or economic establishments in the country. After they had gone, many new
grammar schools
were founded and these, along with the earlier introduction of the printing press, helped to improve
literacy
.
[21]
Food and agriculture
[
edit
]
The agricultural reforms which had begun in the 13th century accelerated in the 16th century, with
enclosure
altering the
open-field system
and denying many of the poor access to land. Large areas of land which had once been
common
, and whose usage had been shared between many people, were now being
enclosed
by the wealthy mainly for extremely profitable sheep farming.
England's food supply was plentiful throughout most of the era; there were no famines. Bad harvests caused distress, but they were usually localised. The most widespread came in 1555-57 and 1596-98.
[22]
In the towns the price of
staples
was fixed by law; in hard times the size of the loaf of bread sold by the baker was smaller.
[23]
The poor consumed a diet largely of bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just arriving at the end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make
bread puddings
, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces.
[24]
At a somewhat higher social level, families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some raised their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries.  Families without a garden could trade with their neighbours to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.
[25]
The people discovered new foods (such as the
potato
and
tomato
imported from the
Americas
), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as coffee and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces, bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use
vinegar
heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The
apricot
was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.
[26]
At the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. Often they celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of her majesty.
17th century
[

Stuart period
and
History of citizenship § Great Britain
England was wracked by civil war over religious issues. Prosperity generally continued in both rural areas and the growing towns,
[27]
as well as the great metropolis of London.
The
English Civil War
was far from just a conflict between two religious faiths, and indeed it had much more to do with divisions within the one
Protestant
religion. The austere, fundamentalist
Puritanism
on the one side was opposed to what it saw as the crypto-Catholic decadence of the
Anglican church
on the other. Divisions also formed along the lines of the common people and the gentry, and between the country and city dwellers. It was a conflict that was bound to disturb all parts of society, and a frequent slogan of the time was "the world turned upside down".
[28]
In 1660 the
Restoration
was a quick transition back to the high-church
Stuarts
. Public opinion reacted against the puritanism of the Puritans, such as the banning of traditional pastimes of gambling, cockfights, the theatre and even Christmas celebrations. The arrival of
Charles II
—The Merry Monarch—brought a relief from the warlike and then strict society that people had lived in for several years. The theatre returned, along with expensive fashions such as the
periwig
and even more expensive commodities from overseas. The
British Empire
grew rapidly after 1600, and along with wealth returning to the country, expensive luxury items were also appearing. Sugar and coffee from the
East Indies
, tea from India and slaves (brought from Africa to the sugar colonies, along with some enslaved servants in England itself) formed the backbone of imperial trade.
[29]
One in nine Englishmen lived in London near the end of the Stuart period.
[30]
However, plagues were even more deadly in a crowded city—the only remedy was to move to isolated rural areas, as
Isaac Newton
of
Cambridge University
did in 1664-66 as the
Great Plague of London
killed as many as 100,000 Londoners.
[31]
The fast-growing metropolis was the centre of politics, high society and business. As a major port and hub of trade, goods from all over were for sale.
Coffee houses
were becoming the centres of business and social life, and it has also been suggested that tea might have played its own part in making Britain powerful, as the
antiseptic
qualities of tea allowed people to live closer together, protecting them from germs, and making the
Industrial Revolution
possible.
[32]
These products can be considered as beginning the
consumer society
which promoted trade and brought development and riches to society.
[33]
Newspapers
were new and soon became important tools of social discourse, and the diarists of the time such as
Samuel Pepys
and
John Evelyn
are some of the best sources we have of everyday life in
Restoration
England. Coffee houses grew numerous and were places for middle-class men to meet, read the papers, look over new books and gossip and share opinions. Thomas Garway operated a coffee house in London from 1657 to 1722. He sold tea, tobacco, snuff, and sandwiches. Businessmen met there informally; the first furs from the
Hudson's Bay Company
were auctioned there.
[34]
[35]
The diet of the poor in the 1660-1750 era was largely bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small quantities of meat and vegetables. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including tea, coffee, and chocolate.
[36]
Crime and punishment
[
edit
]
Historians examining the period 1300-1800 have detected a high level of continuity in their studies of crime and punishment. They have used local records, as well as literary sources, to explore how crime was defined and detected, the changes in the court system, the central importance of elite attitudes toward the poor and dangerous classes, professional criminals, and the amateur and community element in law enforcement before the establishment of police forces in the 19th century.
[37]
The
Black Act of 1723
, sponsored by
Robert Walpole
, strengthened the criminal code. It specified over 200
capital crimes
, many with intensified punishment.
Arson
, for example, was expanded to include burning or the threat of burning haystacks. The legal rights of defendants were strictly limited. For example, suspects who refused to surrender within 40 days could be summarily judged guilty and sentenced to execution if apprehended. Local villages were punished if they failed to find, prosecute and convict alleged criminals.
[38]
From the left, historians such as
E. P. Thompson
have emphasized that crime and disorder were characteristic responses of the working and lower classes to the oppressions imposed upon them. Thompson argues that crime was defined and punished primarily as an activity that threatened the status, property and interests of the elites. England's lower classes were kept under control by large-scale execution, transportation to the colonies, and imprisonment in horrible hulks of old warships. There was no interest in reformation, the goal being to deter through extremely harsh punishment.

Agriculture
[
edit
]
Major advances in farming made agriculture more productive and freed up people to work in industry. The
British Agricultural Revolution
included innovations in technology such as
Jethro Tull
's
seed drill
which allowed greater yields, while the process of enclosure, which had been altering rural society since the Middle Ages, became unstoppable. The new mechanisation needed much larger fields - the layout of the British countryside with the patchwork of fields divided by
hedgerows
that we see today.
Industrial Revolution
[
edit
]
Historians typically date the coming of the
Industrial Revolution
to Britain in the mid-18th century. Not only did existing cities grow but small market towns such as
Manchester
,
Sheffield
and
Leeds
became cities simply by weight of population.
[41]
Middle class and stability
[
edit
]
The
middle class
grew rapidly in the 18th century, especially in the cities.
[42]
At the top of the scale, the legal profession succeeded first, establishing specialist training and associations, and was soon followed by the medical profession. The merchant class prospered with imperial trade. Wahrman (1992) argues that the new urban elites included two types: the gentlemanly capitalist, who participated in the national society, and the independent bourgeois, who was oriented toward the local community. By the 1790s a self-proclaimed middle class, with a particular sociocultural self-perception, had emerged.
[43]
Thanks to increasing national wealth, upward mobility into the middle class, urbanisation, and civic stability, Britain was relatively calm and stable, certainly compared with the revolutions and wars which were convulsing the American colonies, France and other nations at the time.
[44]
The politics of the
French Revolution
did not translate directly into British society to spark an equally seismic revolution, nor did the loss of the
American Colonies
dramatically weaken or disrupt Great Britain.
Religion
[
edit
]
Historians have emphasized the importance of religion, including the domination of the Anglican establishment.
[45]
The
Act of Toleration 1689
granted rights of free religious worship to the non-conformist Protestant sects which had emerged during the Civil War.
Baptists
,
Congregationalists
,
Methodists
, and
Quakers
were all allowed to pray freely. These groups took the opportunity of the expanding empire and set up in the
Thirteen Colonies
, where they expanded rapidly after the
First Great Awakening
.
In response to the religious and moral apathy of the common people, Methodist preachers set up societies divided into
classes
—intimate meetings where individuals were encouraged to confess their sins to one another and to build each other up. They also took part in
love feasts
which allowed for the sharing of testimony and mutual surveillance of moral behavior. The success of
Methodist revivals
in reaching the poor and working classes concentrated their attention on spiritual goals rather than political grievances.
[46]
Cultural history
[
edit
]
Scholars have recently been moving toward cultural history rather than social history. The language and self images of people are the chief targets of cultural studies. Of special importance is the concept of an emerging
consumer society.
Studies of middle- and upper-class manners, tastes, and fashions have proliferated, along with studies of gender, national, and racial identities.
[47]
Victorian era
[

Victorian era
George William Joy
's depiction of men and women travelling in an omnibus in the early Victorian era
The social changes during the Victorian era were wide-ranging and fundamental, leaving their mark not only upon the United Kingdom but upon much of the world which was under Britain's influence during the 19th century. It can even be argued that these changes eclipsed the massive shifts in society during the 20th century; certainly many of the developments of the 20th century have their roots in the 19th. The technology of the
Industrial Revolution
had a great impact on society. Inventions not only introduced new industries for employment, but the products and services produced also altered society.
[48]
The
population of England
almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901.
[49]
Scotland's population also rose rapidly, from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901. Ireland's population decreased rapidly, from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901, mostly due to the
Great Famine
.
[50]
At the same time, around 15 million
emigrants
left the United Kingdom in the Victorian era and settled mostly in the United States, Canada, and Australia.
[51]
Not only did the rapidly expanding
British Empire
attract immigrants, it also attracted temporary administrators, soldiers, missionaries and businessmen who on their return talked up the Empire as a part of greater Britain.
Culturally there was a transition away from the
rationalism
of the Georgian period and toward
romanticism
and mysticism with regard to religion, social values, and the arts.
[52]
The era is popularly associated with the
"Victorian" values of social and sexual restraint
.
The status of the poor is one area in which huge changes occurred. A good illustration of the differences between life in the Georgian and Victorian eras are the writings of two of England's greatest authors,
Jane Austen
and
Charles Dickens
. Both writers held a fascination for people, society and the details of everyday life but in Austen the poor are almost absent, mainly because they were still the rural poor, remote and almost absent from the minds of the middle classes. For Dickens, only a few years later, the poor were his main subject, as he had partly suffered their fate. The poor now were an unavoidable part of urban society and their existence and plight could not be ignored. Industrialisation made large profits for the entrepreneurs of the times, and their success was in contrast not only to the farm workers who were in competition with imported produce but also to the aristocracy whose landowning wealth was now becoming less significant than business wealth. The British class system created an intricate hierarchy of people which contrasted the new and old rich, the skilled and unskilled, the rural and urban and many more.
[53]
Some of the first attacks on industrialisation were the
Luddites
' destruction of machines, but this had less to do with factory conditions and more to do with machines mass-producing linen much quicker and cheaper than the handmade products of skilled labourers. The army was called to the areas of Luddite activity such as
Lancashire
and
Yorkshire
and for a time there were more British soldiers controlling the Luddites than fighting Napoleon in Spain. The squalid, dangerous and oppressive conditions of many of the new Victorian factories and the surrounding communities which rose to service them became important issues of discontent, and the workers began to form
trade unions
to get their working conditions addressed.
[54]
The first unions were feared and distrusted, and ways were devised to ban them. The most widely known case was that of the
Tolpuddle Martyrs
of 1834, an early attempt at a union whose members were tried on a spurious charge, found guilty and
transported
to
Australia
. The sentence was challenged and they were released shortly afterwards, but unions were still threatened. It was not until the formation of the
TUC
in 1868 and the passing of the
Trade Union Act 1871
that union membership became reasonably legitimate. Many pieces of legislation were passed to improve working conditions, including the
Ten Hours Act 1847
to reduce working hours, and these culminated in the
Factory Act 1901
.
[55]
Many of these acts resulted from the blight of
Britain's agricultural depression
.  Beginning in 1873 and lasting until 1896, many farmers and rural workers were hard-pressed for a stable income. With the decline in wheat prices and land productivity many countrymen were left looking for any hope of prosperity. Although the British parliament gave substantial aid to farmers and labourers, many still complained that rents were too high, wages too low, and the hours labourers were required to work were too long for their income. As a result, many workers turned to unions to have their concerns heard and, with the acts listed above as proof, were able to achieve some success.
[56]
Environmental and health standards rose throughout the Victorian era; improvements in nutrition may also have played a role, although the importance of this is debated.
[57]
Sewage works were improved as was the quality of drinking water. With a healthier environment, diseases were caught less easily and did not spread as much. Technology was also improving because the population had more money to spend on medical technology (for example, techniques to prevent death in childbirth so more women and children survived), which also led to a greater number of cures for diseases. However, a
cholera
epidemic took place in London in 1848-49 killing 14,137, and subsequently in 1853 killing 10,738. This anomaly was attributed to the closure and replacement of
cesspits
by the modern sewerage systems.
[58]
Communications and travel
[
edit
]
The railways changed communications and society dramatically
Communication improved rapidly. Stage coaches, canal boats, steam ships and most notably the railways all speeded up the movement of people, goods and ideas. New communication methods were very fast if not instantaneous, including the telegraph, the telephone and the trans-oceanic cable.
Trains opened up leisure destinations, especially seaside resorts. The
Bank Holidays Act 1871
created a number of fixed holidays which the middle class could enjoy.  Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as
Worthing
,
Brighton
,
Morecambe
and
Scarborough
began turning them into major tourist centres, and people like
Thomas Cook
saw arranging for domestic and foreign tourism as a viable business model.  Steam ships such as the
SS Great Britain
and
SS Great Western
made international travel more common but also advanced trade, so that in Britain it was not just the luxury goods of earlier times that were imported into the country but essentials such as grain and meat from North America and Australia. One more important innovation in communications was the
Penny Black
, the first
postage stamp
, which standardised postage to a flat price regardless of distance sent.
The Victorians were impressed by science and progress, and felt that they could improve society in the same way as they were improving technology. The model town of
Saltaire
was founded, along with others, as a planned environment with good sanitation and many civic, educational and recreational facilities, although it lacked a pub, which was regarded as a focus of dissent. Similar sanitation reforms, prompted by the Public Health Acts
1848
and
1869
, were made in the crowded, dirty streets of the existing cities, and soap was the main product shown in the relatively new phenomenon of advertising. Victorians also strove to improve society through many charities and relief organisations such as the
Salvation Army
, the
RSPCA
and the
NSPCC
, and at the same time there were many people such as
Florence Nightingale
trying to reform areas of public life. Another new institution was
Robert Peel
's "peelers", one of the earliest formal
police
forces.
Women and the family
[
edit
]
Reformers organised many movements to obtain greater rights for women; voting rights did not come until the next century.
[59]
[60]
The
Married Women's Property Act 1882
meant that women did not lose their right to their own property when they got married and could divorce without fear of poverty, although divorce was frowned upon and very rare during the 19th century. It is too much to claim that the Victorians "invented childhood," but they deemed it the most significant phase of life.
[61]
The trend was towards smaller families, probably because of the rise of modern inner-directed families, coupled with lower infant mortality rates and longer life spans. Legislation reduced the working hours of children while raising the minimum working age, and the passing of the
Elementary Education Act 1870
set the basis for universal primary education.
In
local government elections
, unmarried women
ratepayers
received the right to vote in the
Municipal Franchise Act 1869
. This right was confirmed in the
Local Government Act 1894
and extended to include some married women.
[62]
[63]
By 1900, more than 1 million women were registered to vote in local government elections in England.
[64]
Divorce
[
edit
]
In Britain before 1857 wives were under the economic and legal control of their husbands, and divorce was almost impossible. It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps £200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford.  It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1857
, which passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England.  The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about £40, but now became feasible for the middle class.  A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a
feme sole,
with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace.  The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973
.

Home front during World War I § Britain
Edwardian ideals were a bit more liberal 1901-1914, but what really changed society was the
Great War
. The army was traditionally never a large employer in the nation, and the regular army stood at 247,000 at the start of the war. By 1918 there were about five million people in the army and the fledgling
Royal Air Force
, newly formed from the
RNAS
and the
RFC
, was about the same size of the pre-war army. The almost three million casualties were known as the "lost generation", and such numbers inevitably left society scarred; but even so, some people felt their sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like
Siegfried Sassoon
's
Blighters
criticising the ill-informed
jingoism
of the
home front
.
Conscription
brought people of many different classes, and also people from all over the empire, together and this mixing was seen as a great leveller which would only accelerate social change after the war.
1920s

Interwar Britain
and
Roaring Twenties
The social reforms of the previous century continued into the twentieth with the
Labour Party
being formed in 1900, but this did not achieve major success until the 1922 general election.
Lloyd George
said after the World War that "the nation was now in a molten state", and his
Housing Act 1919
would lead to affordable
council housing
which allowed people to move out of Victorian
inner-city
slums. The slums, though, remained for several more years, with
trams
being electrified long before many houses.
[67]
The
Representation of the People Act 1918
gave women householders the vote, and in 1928 full equal suffrage was achieved.
[68]
After the War, many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. The shortage of servants was felt in the kitchen, but now instead of an experience cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the ordinary housewife working alone could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Breakfast porridge from branded, more finely milled, oats could now be cooked in two minutes, not 20. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor.  Street vendors were fewer. Shops were upgraded; the flies were gone as were the open barrels of biscuits and pickles. Groceries and butcher shops carried more bottled and canned goods as well as fresher meat, fish and vegetables. Whereas wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choices, the 1920s saw many new kinds of foods—especially fruits—imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene.  Middle classes households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.

Great Depression

Great Depression in the United Kingdom
The relatively prosperous 1920s gave way by 1930 to a

[70]
[71]
Particularly hardest hit were the north of England and Wales, where unemployment reached 70% in some areas. The
General Strike
was called during 1926 in support of the miners and their falling wages, but it failed. The strike marked the start of the slow decline of the British coal industry. In 1936 two hundred unemployed men walked from
Jarrow
to
London
in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor, but the
Jarrow March
, had little impact and it was not until 1940 that industrial prospects improved.

The war was a "people's war" that enlisted every party, class and every region and every interest, with strikingly little dissent.
[72]
It was started with a "
phony war
" with little fighting. Fear of bombing led to
women and children were moved from London
and other cities liable to air raids and evacuated to the country. Most returned some months later and remained in the cities until the end of the war. There were half the number of military casualties in this war than the last, but the improvements in aerial warfare meant that there were many more civilian casualties and a foreign war seemed much closer to home. The early years of the war in which Britain "stood alone" and
the Blitz
spirit which developed as Britain suffered under aerial bombardment helped pull the nation together after the divisions of the previous decade, and campaigns such as "
Dig for Victory
" helped give the nation a common purpose. The focus on agriculture to feed the nation gave some people their first introduction to the countryside, and women played an important part in the war effort as the
Land Girls
.
[73]
A half a million women served in the armed forces, led by
Princess Elizabeth
, the future queen, who donned the
ATS soldier's uniform
as a lorry driver.

Austerity: 1945-51
[
edit
]
The
Labour Party
victory in 1945 represented pent-up frustrations.  The strong sense that all Britons had joined in a "People's War" and all deserved a reward animated voters.  But the Treasury was near bankruptcy and Labour's nationalization programs were expensive.  Prewar levels of prosperity did not return until the 1950s. It was called the Age of Austerity.
[75]
The most important reform was the founding of the
National Health Service
on 5 July 1948. It promised to give
cradle to grave
care for everyone in the country, regardless of income.
[76]
Wartime rationing continued, and was extended to bread. In the war the government banned ice cream and rationed sweets, such as chocolates and confections; sweets were rationed until 1954.
[77]
Most people grumbled, but for the poorest, rationing was beneficial, because their rationed diet was of greater nutritional value than their pre-war diet. Housewives organized to oppose the austerity.
[78]
The Conservatives saw their opening and rebuilt their fortunes by attacking socialism, austerity, rationing, and economic controls, and were back in power by 1951.
[79]
Prosperous 1950s
[
edit
]
As prosperity returned after 1950, Britons became more family centred.
[80]
Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war.
Holiday camps
, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s - and people increasingly had money to pursue their personal hobbies. The
BBC
's early television service was given a major boost in 1953 with the coronation of
Elizabeth II
, attracting an estimated audience of twenty million, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950 1% owned television sets; by 1965 75% did.  As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.
[81]
Small neighbourhood stores were increasingly replaced by
chain stores
and
shopping centres
, with their wide variety of goods, smart-advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and
ribbon developments
springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the
green belt
to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.
[82]
1960s
[
edit
]
The 1960s saw dramatic shifts in attitudes and values led by youth.  It was a worldwide phenomenon, in which British rock musicians, especially
The Beatles
, played an international role.
[83]
The generations divided sharply regarding the new sexual freedom demanded by youth who listened to bands like
The Rolling Stones
.
[84]
Sexual morals shifted towards greater acceptance of sexual behaviors and identities that had been considered taboo or immoral.  One notable event was the publication of
D. H. Lawrence
's
Lady Chatterley's Lover
by
Penguin Books
in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive mass-market paperback version prompted a court case. The prosecuting council's question, "Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?" highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen as one of the first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. Other elements of the
sexual revolution
included the development of
The Pill
,
Mary Quant
's
miniskirt
and the 1967 legalisation of
homosexuality
. There was a rise in the incidence of divorce and abortion, and a resurgence of the
women's liberation movement
, whose campaigning helped secure the
Equal Pay Act
and the
Sex Discrimination Act
in 1975.
The 1960s were a time of greater disregard for the
establishment,
with a satire boom led by people who were willing to attack their elders.
Pop music
became a dominant form of expression for the young, and bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were seen as leaders of
youth culture
. Youth-based
subcultures
such as the
mods
,
rockers
,
hippies
and
skinheads
became more visible.
Reforms in education led to the effective elimination of the
grammar school
. The rise of the
comprehensive school
was aimed at producing a more egalitarian educational system, and there were ever-increasing numbers of people going into higher education.
In the 1950s and 1960s,
immigration of people to the United Kingdom
, mainly from former British colonies in the Caribbean, India and Pakistan, began to escalate, leading to
racism
. Dire predictions were made about the effect of these new arrivals on British society (most famously
Enoch Powell
's
Rivers of Blood speech
), and tension led to a few
race riots
. In the longer term, many people with differing cultures have successfully integrated into the country, and some have risen to high positions.
[85]
1980s
[
edit
]
One important change during the 1980s was the opportunity given to many to buy their
council houses
, which resulted in many more people becoming property owners in a
stakeholder society.
At the same time, Conservative
Margaret Thatcher
weakened her bitter enemy, the trade unions.
[86]
[87]
The
environmentalism
movements of the 1980s reduced the emphasis on
intensive farming
, and promoted
organic farming
and
conservation
of the countryside.
[88]
Religious observance declined notably in Britain during the second half of the 20th century, even with the growth of non-Christian religions due to immigration and travel (see
Islam in the UK
).
Church of England
attendance has particularly dropped, although
charismatic
churches like
Elim
and
AOG
are growing. The movement to
Keep Sunday Special
seemed to have lost at the beginning of the 21st century.
[89]
1990s and the new millennium
[
edit
]
Following on from the resurgence of
economic liberalism
in the 1980s, the last decade of the 20th century was noted for a greater embrace of
social liberalism
within British society, largely attributed to the greater influence of the generation born in the socially transformative 1960s. In 1990, 69% of Britons surveyed believed homosexuality was morally wrong; by the end of the decade this had fallen to below half, and the legal age of consent for homosexual sexual activity had been lowered to 16, in line with heterosexual sex.
[90]
The
death of Diana, Princess of Wales
in 1997 was also observed to have demonstrated the way in which social attitudes towards mourning had changed, with the unprecedented mass public outpourings of grief that characterised the days after her death being remarked upon as reflecting a change in the national psyche.
[91]
Growing disparity in the relative affluence of those who have benefitted and those 'left behind' from the
deindustrialisation
and
globalisation
of the economy was attributed as one of the primary factors behind the surprise victory of the 'leave' campaign in the
2016 European Union membership referendum
, and began wider discourse on the emergence of 'two countries' within England that represented greatly differing social attitudes and outlooks.
[92]
Historiography
[
edit
]
The social history of the medieval period was primarily developed by
Eileen Power
, H. S. Bennett, Ambrose Raftis,
Rodney Hilton
, and Sylvia Thrupp before the rise of the
New Social History
in the 1960s.
Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on an "orthodox" school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made "impressive progress" in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal
Rural History
. Led by
Alun Howkins
,
[93]
it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.

The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs
is a song for voice and closed piano by
John Cage
. It was composed in late 1942 and quickly became a minor classic in Cage's oeuvre.
[1]
The text was a reworked version of a passage from
James Joyce
's
Finnegans Wake
.
General information
[
edit
]
The song was commissioned by singer
Janet Fairbank
, who later became known for pioneering contemporary music. Cage chose to set a passage from page 556 of
Finnegans Wake
, a book he bought soon after its publication in 1939. The composition is based, according to Cage himself, on the impressions received from the passage.
[2]
The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs
marks the start of Cage's interest in Joyce and is the first piece among many in which he uses the writer's work.
The vocal line only uses three
pitches
, while the piano remains closed and the pianist produces sounds by hitting the lid or other parts of the instrument in a variety of ways (with his fingers, with his knuckles, etc.). Almost immediately after its composition the song became one of Cage's most frequently performed works, and was several times performed by the celebrated duo of
Cathy Berberian
and
Luciano Berio
. Cage later composed another piece for voice and closed piano,
A Flower
, and a companion piece to
The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs
, called
Nowth upon Nacht
, also based on Joyce's book.
In 1976,
Robert Wyatt
performed a version on the split LP
Voices and Instruments
attributed to
Jan Steele
and John Cage, produced by
Brian Eno
and released on his
Obscure Records
label. In 1993,
Joey Ramone
performed a version on the compilation
Caged/Uncaged - A Rock/Experimental Homage To John Cage

It seems that the name was originally Alpin, quickly softened to Albin by
Bede
and the martyrologies which succeed him. According to them, Albin succeeds
Justus
in 390 and was a holy bishop.
[2]
Tradition assigns him the foundation of the St. Stephen's Church, where he was buried. He died shortly before 400AD.

American physician
William Howard Hay
Hay in 1934
Born
December 14, 1866
Hartstown, Pennsylvania
Died
1940
Occupation(s)
Physician
, writer
William Howard Hay
(December 14, 1866 - 1940) was an American
physician
and director of The East Aurora Sun and Diet Sanatorium. He is principally known for the '
Hay diet
', a
food-combining
dietary
system.
Career
[
edit
]
Hay graduated from the
New York University Medical College
in 1891 and was licensed in
Pennsylvania
. Following graduation he practiced in
Youngsville
, and was the surgeon for the American Tinplate Company of
New Castle
.
[1]
While he was in Pennsylvania he set-up the Hay Rest Cure which was advertised as "a special service department for the cure of hay fever cases".
[1]
In 1905, it seems he had an episode of acute heart failure following running for a train.
[2]
As a result, he discovered that he had
Bright's disease
(or
hypertension
) with a dilated
heart
, a condition with a poor prognosis at the time.  As a consequence he changed his diet, discontinued coffee and stopped smoking.
[2]
His condition improved, he lost weight and his blood pressure fell. Over the next 4 years he developed a dietary system based on this experience.
[2]
The dietary system he developed involved fasting and promoted the idea that certain foods require an
acid
pH environment in digestion, and other foods require an
alkaline
pH environment, and that both cannot take place at the same time, in the same environment.
In 1921 he went to
Buffalo
and in 1927 he was appointed director of The East Aurora Sun and Diet
Sanatorium
.
[3]
[4]
where he developed the 'Sun-Diet Menus'. In this period Hay was a member of the Medical Advisory Board of the Defensive Diet League of America, and campaigned against the use of aluminum cooking utensils,
[1]
vivisection
[5]
and vaccination for smallpox.
[6]
[7]
In 1930 he resigned from his local medical society just before charges of unethical advertising were preferred.
[1]
In 1932 he purchased the Pocono Hay-ven resort and in 1935 became the Medical Director of Hay System, Inc. The Hay diet was popular around that time and many restaurants offered 'Hay-friendly' menus; followers of his dietary advice, who called themselves “Hayites”, included
Henry Ford
.
[8]
Reception
[
edit
]
Hay was criticized in the
Journal of the American Medical Association
as a food-faddist
[1]
and later for advocating that a patient with type 1 diabetes stop taking insulin.
[9]
Physician
Logan Clendening
described the Hay Diet as a "half-baked unscientific food fad"
[10]
Jeffrey M. Pilcher a Professor of Food History has noted that:
[Hay] believed that carbohydrates and proteins should never be eaten at the same meal because the body uses alkaline enzymes to digest 
carbohydrates whereas acids work on proteins. Thus, if a person ate both types of foods together, the alkalines and acids would neutralize one another, the stomach would be unable to digest anything, and the food would simply rot in the intestines... His theory was exposed as flawed because the alkaline enzymes operate in one part of the intestine and the acids in another.
[11]
Hay's dieting ideas have received continual criticism over lack of a scientific basis.
[12]
[13]
[14]
However, the Hay diet and its variants, such as the Kensington diet
[15]
and the
Beverly Hills Diet
,
[13]
have remained popular to this day,
[16]
with actors such as
Elizabeth Hurley
,
Helen Mirren
and
Catherine Zeta-Jones
following food-combining diets.

Genre(s)
Adventure
Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game
is a
handheld electronic game
released by
Mattel
in 1981.
[1]
Designer
Peter Oliphant
claims that it was one of the more basic projects he worked on during his career.
[2]
Release
[
edit
]
The
Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game
was released in the fall of 1981.
[3]
Mattel stated that the game immediately sold out, setting it apart from some of Mattel Electronics' more well-known sports-themed handhelds.
[4]
Display
[
edit
]
The game unit is a portable game with an
LCD
screen, and is powered by watch batteries.
[5]
The game opens with an isometric view of a simple 3D dungeon. The player is represented by a minor character who appears to be holding a sword aloft. The protagonist is at a crossroads in four passageways. The character's placement is indicated by an expanded letter and number, which always starts at A0. A cursor button moves a black arrow in one of four directions, while a move button moves the surface in the same way.
[

]
The character that the player would be controlling and the maze are depicted in the bottom left corner of the tiny screen, giving room for other icons that indicate when other items and monsters are nearby in one of the four directions. This contains a bat that can randomly pick the character up and place the character elsewhere in the maze. There is also a pit that will kill the character if the character does not have a rope to pull the character out of the pot. The rope occurs at the beginning of the game's most accessible setting, in the dungeon in the intermediate location, and there is no rope in the most challenging environment.
[6]
Gameplay
[
edit
]
The LCD screen displayed a dungeon junction in quasi-three dimensions, coupled with hints of routes that the player may explore further. Each intersection also featured a number and letter designation, allowing the player to create a map while searching. The dungeon itself was made up of 100 squares laid out in ten rows ten. However, because the dungeon circled around itself, if the player were to walk beyond the edge in any direction, the character would resurface at the other edge.
[7]
The gameplay is similar to
Hunt The Wumpus
, in that the player moves through a maze, must beware of bats and pits, and must find an arrow and shoot it at the dragon without entering its lair directly.
[8]
To win, the player must first find the magical arrow, then the dragon, and then shoot it with the weapon while in another room.
Every few seconds, an ominous four-tone piece of music plays as the player navigates through the maze. Each movement is accompanied by a tapping sound that is meant to indicate movement. The player will hear a descending sound followed by a few notes from a death dirge if the character falls into a pit. Unlike Hunt for the Wumpus, D&D's gameplay takes place on a ten by ten grid, with each square representing a different room.
[9]
The positioning of the dozen pits, the magical arrow, rope, and dragon are determined at random in each game. When the player wins, the player is given a score based on how long it took to complete the game, with one point provided for every five seconds. With its silly, off-set LCD screen and weird graphic of white-outlined cobblestones, the entire game is approximately the size of an inch-thick or so credit card. According to Oliphant, the game was much easier to code because it was turn-based and followed a set of rules rather than relying on real-time activity.
[10]
"I felt the layout was fantastic for a turn-based game," he continued. "The LCD art was fantastic - you could tell right immediately that the monsters were bats and a dragon." As a result, I was pleased with the final product."
[11]
While he was working on the prototype, another group was in charge of programming the production version that was presented to the market. He does recall, though, that it was a system with limited memory that made full use of it.
[12]
"It wasn't as difficult as some of my past games," he said. "It was definitely one of the easier assignments I've done in terms of my engagement."
[13]
Oliphant believes Mattel Electronics sought to venture out from its usual sports games for this handheld in order to get numerous different licenses for new properties in order to widen the type of games they were developing. As a result, licensed games like Battlestar Galactica, Flash Gordon, and Masters of the Universe were developed, as well as non-licensed oddities like Chess, Backgammon, and the Horoscope Computer.
[14]
Reception
[
edit
]
Electronic Games
in 1983 wrote that
Dungeons & Dragons
"is sure to win your heart". The magazine liked the gameplay and sound effects, and concluded that it "is an exciting and novel approach to the famous fantasy game".
[15]
Bats found in the game could transport you to another spot on the map, which could get extremely annoying. There was also a countdown clock that indicated the passage of time. While playing, You have to be quick, alert, and lucky to win. You could accomplish everything perfectly and yet still lose due to uncontrollable forces, which is one of the many reasons that players get frustrated while playing.

Batman
[a]
is a
superhero
appearing in
American comic books
published by
DC Comics
. The character was created by artist
Bob Kane
and writer
Bill Finger
, and debuted in
the 27th issue
of the comic book
Detective Comics
on March 30, 1939. In the
DC Universe
continuity, Batman is the alias of
Bruce Wayne
, a wealthy American
playboy
,
philanthropist
, and industrialist who resides in
Gotham City
.
Batman's origin story
features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents
Thomas
and
Martha
as a child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of
justice
. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a
bat-inspired
persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with
supporting characters
, including his sidekicks
Robin
and
Batgirl
; allies
Alfred Pennyworth
,
James Gordon
, and
Catwoman
; and
foes
such as the
Penguin
, the
Riddler
,
Two-Face
, and his
archenemy
, the
Joker
.
Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's
Superman
; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more
bat
-like. The character received his own
spin-off
publication,
Batman
, in 1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any
superpowers
, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s
Batman
television series used a
camp
aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986
miniseries
The Dark Knight Returns
by
Frank Miller
.
DC has featured Batman in
many comic books
, including comics published under its
imprints
such as
Vertigo
and
Black Label
. The longest-running Batman comic,
Detective Comics
, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and
Wonder Woman
, as a member of organizations such as the
Justice League
and the
Outsiders
. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as
Jean-Paul Valley
/
Azrael
in the 1993-1994 "
Knightfall
" story arc;
Dick Grayson
, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and
Jace Fox
, son of Wayne's ally
Lucius
, as of 2021.
[4]
DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in
The Dark Knight Returns
and its successors,
the incarnation
from the
Flashpoint
(2011) event, and numerous interpretations from
Elseworlds
stories.
One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in
various media
and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as
Lego Batman
and video games like the
Batman: Arkham
series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s
Batman
television series played by
Adam West
and
in film
by
Michael Keaton
in
Batman
(1989),
Batman Returns

Creation
First published image of Batman, in
Action Comics
#12, announcing the character's debut in the forthcoming
Detective Comics
#27
[5]
In early 1939, the success of
Superman
in
Action Comics
prompted editors at
National Comics Publications
(the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response,
Bob Kane
created "the Bat-Man".
[6]
Collaborator
Bill Finger
recalled that "Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ...reddish tights, I believe, with boots ...no gloves, no gauntlets ...with a small
domino mask
, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ...BATMAN".
[7]
The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by
Leonardo da Vinci
's sketch of an
ornithopter
flying device.
[8]
Finger suggested giving the character a
cowl
instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume.
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: "Bruce Wayne's first name came from
Robert the Bruce
, the
Scottish
patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ...then I thought of
Mad Anthony Wayne
."
[13]
He later said his suggestions were influenced by
Lee Falk
's popular
The Phantom
, a
syndicated
newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also familiar.
[14]
Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods, and weaponry. Details find predecessors in
pulp fiction
,
comic strips
,
newspaper
headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself.
[15]
As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in
the Scarlet Pimpernel
(created by
Baroness Emmuska Orczy
, 1903) and
Zorro
(created by
Johnston McCulley
, 1919). Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films
The Mark of Zorro
(1920) and
The Bat Whispers
(1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like
Doc Savage
,
The Shadow
,
Dick Tracy
, and
Sherlock Holmes
, made the character a master sleuth.
[16]
[17]
In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:
One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.' He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.
[14]
Golden Age
Subsequent creation credit
Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say "Batman created by Bob Kane"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when
Jerry Siegel
and
Joe Shuster
began receiving a "created by" credit on the Superman titles, along with
William Moulton Marston
being given the byline for creating
Wonder Woman
, Batman stories began saying "Created by Bob Kane" in addition to the other credits.
Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of
Batman
#169 (February 1965) for example, editor
Julius Schwartz
names him as the creator of the
Riddler
, one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, "Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by."
[13]
At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.
Jerry Robinson
, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with
The Comics Journal
:
Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why ...[he was] going to leave [Kane's employ]. ...[Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there. ...That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same co-creator credit in the strip, writer, and artist.
[18]
Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that "it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the ''Batman, t'  [
sic
] as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue." Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. "The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator."
[19]
In 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview:
In those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of DC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I never volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.
[20]
In September 2015,
DC Entertainment
revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman's creation on the 2016 superhero film
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
and the second season of
Gotham
after a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC.
[2]
Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with
Batman and
Robin
Eternal
#3 and
Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis
#3. The updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as "Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger".
[3]
Early years
Batman made his debut in
Detective Comics
#27
(
cover dated
May 1939), cover art by
Bob Kane
The first Batman story, "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate", was published in
Detective Comics
#27
(
cover dated
May 1939). It was inspired, some say
[
who?
]
plagiarized, by the 60 page story “Partners of Peril” in
The Shadow
#113, which was written by
Theodore Tinsley
and illustrated by
Tom Lovell
.
[21]
Finger said, "Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps",
[22]
and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in
Detective Comics
. By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.
[23]
The two characters were featured side by side as the stars of
World's Finest Comics
, which was originally titled
World's Best Comics
when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including
Jerry Robinson
and
Dick Sprang
also worked on the strips during this period.
Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman", Kane said.
[24]
Batman's characteristic utility belt
was introduced in
Detective Comics
#29 (July 1939), followed by the
boomerang
-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the
Batplane
, in #31 (September 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (November 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that "by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals".
[25]
[26]
[27]
The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in
Detective Comics
#38 (April 1940) with the introduction of
Robin
, Batman's junior counterpart.
[28]
Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a "
Watson
" with whom Batman could talk.
[29]
Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of "kid sidekicks".
[30]
The first issue of the solo spin-off series
Batman
was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the
Joker
and
Catwoman
, but for a pre-Robin inventory story, originally meant for
Detective Comics
#38, in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death.
[31]
[32]
That story prompted editor
Whitney Ellsworth
to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.
[33]
By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos.
[34]
In the years following World War II, DC Comics "adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy". The impact of this editorial approach was evident in
Batman
comics of the postwar period; removed from the "bleak and menacing world" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a "bright and colorful" environment.
[35]
Silver and Bronze Ages
1950s and early 1960s
Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story "The Mightiest Team in the World" in
Superman
#76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity.
[36]
Following the success of this story,
World's Finest Comics
was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.
[37]
The team-up of the characters was "a financial success in an era when those were few and far between";
[38]
this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986.
Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist
Fredric Wertham
's book
Seduction of the Innocent
in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed
homosexual
overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.
[39]
Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the
Comics Code Authority
, a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The tendency towards a "sunnier Batman" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code.
[40]
Scholars have suggested that the characters of
Batwoman
(in 1956) and the pre-
Barbara Gordon
Bat-Girl
(in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.
[41]
In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.
[42]
New characters such as Batwoman, the original Bat-Girl,
Ace the Bat-Hound
, and
Bat-Mite
were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the
Justice League
of America in
The Brave and the Bold
#28 (February 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic book series starting later that same year.
"New Look" Batman and camp
By 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was "planning to kill Batman off altogether".
[43]
In response to this, editor
Julius Schwartz
was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's
Detective Comics
#327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the "New Look". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist
Carmine Infantino
to help overhaul the character. The
Batmobile
was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet Cooper, came to live with Bruce Wayne and
Dick Grayson
.
[44]
The debut of the
Batman
television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and
Batman
reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies.
[45]
Elements such as the character of
Batgirl
and the show's
campy
nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, "When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books."
[46]
Cover of
Batman
#227 (November 1970) returning Batman to the darker roots of the original publications. Art by Neal Adams.
Starting in 1969, writer
Dennis O'Neil
and artist
Neal Adams
made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a "grim avenger of the night".
[47]
O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."
[48]
O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story "
The Secret of the Waiting Graves
" in
Detective Comics
#395 (January 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker
Dick Giordano
, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was "tremendous".
[49]
Giordano said: "We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well ..."
[50]
While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer
Steve Englehart
and penciler
Marshall Rogers
in
Detective Comics
#471-476 (August 1977 - April 1978), which went on to influence the 1989 movie
Batman
and be adapted for
Batman: The Animated Series
, which debuted in 1992.
[51]
Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.
[52]
Modern Age
The Dark Knight Returns
Frank Miller
's limited series
The Dark Knight Returns
(February-June 1986) returned the character to his darker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated interest in the character.
The Dark Knight Returns
was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.
[53]
The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity.
[54]
That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering 12-issue miniseries
Crisis on Infinite Earths
. O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before.
[55]
One outcome of this new approach was the "
Year One
" storyline in
Batman
#404-407 (February-May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist
David Mazzucchelli
redefined the character's origins.
[56]
Writer
Alan Moore
and artist
Brian Bolland
continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page
one-shot issue
Batman: The Killing Joke
, in which the Joker, attempting to drive
Commissioner Gordon
insane, cripples Gordon's daughter
Barbara
, and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.
[57]
The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a
900 number
for readers to call to vote on whether
Jason Todd
, the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes (see
Batman: A Death in the Family
).
[56]
Knightfall
The 1993 "
Knightfall
" story arc introduced a new villain,
Bane
, who critically injures Batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance. Jean-Paul Valley, known as
Azrael
, is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers
Doug Moench
,
Chuck Dixon
, and
Alan Grant
worked on the Batman titles during "Knightfall", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's "
Cataclysm
" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's "
No Man's Land
", a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of "No Man's Land", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by
Bob Schreck
.
[58]
Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was
Jeph Loeb
. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries (
The Long Halloween
and
Dark Victory
) that pit an early-in-his-career version of Batman against his entire
rogues gallery
(including
Two-Face
, whose origin was re-envisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving
serial killers
Holiday
and the
Hangman
.
21st century
Hush
and
Under the Hood
In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist
Jim Lee
to work on another mystery arc: "
Batman: Hush
" for the main Batman book. The 12-issue story line has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery, including an apparently resurrected
Jason Todd
, while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain
Hush
.
[59]
While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. The series became #1 on the
Diamond Comic Distributors
sales chart for the first time since
Batman
#500 (October 1993) and Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer
Judd Winick
's subsequent run as writer on
Batman
, with another multi-issue arc, "
Under the Hood
", which ran from
Batman
#637-650 (April 2005 - April 2006).

All Star DC Comics
In 2005, DC launched
All Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder
, a stand-alone comic book miniseries set outside the main DC Universe continuity. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC Comics,
[60]
[61]
although it was widely panned by critics for its writing, characterization, and strong depictions of violence.
[62]
[63]
Grant Morrison's Batman Run
Starting in 2006,
Grant Morrison
and
Paul Dini
were the regular writers of
Batman
and
Detective Comics
, with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the science fiction-themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman experienced under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training. Morrison's run climaxed with "
Batman R.I.P.
", which brought Batman up against the villainous "Black Glove" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. "Batman R.I.P." segued into
Final Crisis
(also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of
Darkseid
. In the 2009 miniseries
Batman: Battle for the Cowl
, Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son Damian becomes the new Robin.
[64]
[65]
In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing
Batman
, while Grant Morrison was given their own series, titled
Batman and Robin
.
[66]
In 2010, the storyline
Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne
saw Bruce travel through history, eventually returning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his crime-fighting cause globally, which is the central focus of
Batman Incorporated
. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in
Batman
,
Detective Comics
, and
Batman and Robin
, while Wayne would be the main character in
Batman Incorporated
. Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series,
Batman: The Dark Knight
.
The New 52

The New 52
In September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero comic books, including its
Batman
franchise, were cancelled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of
The New 52
reboot
. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in
Batman
,
Detective Comics
,
Batman and Robin
, and
Batman: The Dark Knight
. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact.
Batman Incorporated
was relaunched in 2012-2013 to complete the "Leviathan" storyline.
With the beginning of
The New 52
,
Scott Snyder
was the writer of the
Batman
title. His first major story arc was "
Night of the Owls
", where Batman confronts the
Court of Owls
, a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was "
Death of the Family
", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was "
Batman: Zero Year
", which redefined Batman's origin in
The New 52
. It followed
Batman
vol. 2 #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years. The final storyline before the
Convergence
(2015) storyline was "
Endgame
", depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.
Starting with
Batman
vol. 2 #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, robotic-Batman, debuting in the
Free Comic Book Day
special comic
Divergence
. However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now with almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend,
Julie Madison
, but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a "strange star" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor. Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shut down.
[67]
In 2015, DC Comics released
The Dark Knight III: The Master Race
, the sequel to Frank Miller's
The Dark Knight Returns
and
The Dark Knight Strikes Again
.
[68]
DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier
In June 2016, the
DC Rebirth
event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles.
Batman
was rebooted as starting with a one-shot issue entitled
Batman: Rebirth
#1 (August 2016). The series then began shipping twice-monthly as a third volume, starting with
Batman
vol. 3 #1 (August 2016). The third volume of
Batman
was written by
Tom King
, and artwork was provided by
David Finch
and Mikel Janín. The
Batman
series introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl.
Detective Comics
resumed its original numbering system starting with June 2016's #934, and the
New 52
series was labeled as volume 2, with issues numbering from #1-52.
[69]
Similarly with the
Batman
title, the
New 52
issues were labeled as volume 2 and encompassed issues #1-52. Writer
James Tynion IV
and artists
Eddy Barrows
and Alvaro Martinez worked on
Detective Comics
#934, and the series initially featured a team consisting of
Tim Drake
,
Stephanie Brown
,
Cassandra Cain
, and
Clayface
, led by Batman and
Batwoman
.
DC Comics ended the
DC Rebirth
branding in December 2017, opting to include everything under a larger
DC Universe
banner and naming. The continuity established by
DC Rebirth
continues across DC's comic book titles, including volume 1 of
Detective Comics
and volume 3 of
Batman
.
[70]
[71]
After the conclusion of
Batman
vol. 3 #85
[72]
a new creative team consisting of
James Tynion IV
with art by
Tony S. Daniel
and
Danny Miki
replaced
Tom King
, David Finch and Mikel Janín. Following Tynion's departure from DC Comics, Joshua Williamson, who previously wrote the backup story in issue #106, briefly became the new head writer in December 2021 starting with issue #118.
[73]
Chip Zdarsky
then became the head writer with artist Jorge Jimenez returning after having previously illustrated parts of Tynion's run. Their run begun with issue #125, which was released on July 5, 2022 and starts with "Failsafe", a six-issue story arc.

Characterization
Bruce Wayne
"Bruce Wayne" redirects here. For other uses, see
Bruce Wayne (disambiguation)
.
DC Comics concept art of Bruce Wayne by Mikel Janín
Batman's
secret identity
is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents,
Dr. Thomas Wayne
and
Martha Wayne
, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence,
Wayne Manor
. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of
Wayne Enterprises
, his inherited conglomerate.
[75]
[76]
He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.
[77]
In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised
ginger ale
since Wayne is actually a strict
teetotaler
to maintain his physical and mental prowess.
[78]
Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.
[79]
Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade.
[80]
This is in contrast to the Post-
Crisis
Superman, whose
Clark Kent
persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade.
[81]
[82]
In
Batman Unmasked
, a television documentary about the psychology of the character, behavioral scientist
Benjamin Karney
notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that "Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better". Bruce Wayne's principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we fail for a reason and anything is possible.
[83]
Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison
[84]
notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. Morrison notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book
Unleashing the Superhero in Us All
explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.
[85]
Will Brooker notes in his book
Batman Unmasked
that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience ...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ...and they're never wrong."
[86]
Personality
Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as
"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession"
.
[87]
The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: "
Julie Schwartz
did a Batman in
Batman
and
Detective
and
Murray Boltinoff
did a Batman in the
Brave and the Bold
and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days."
[88]
The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes".
[89]
Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist
[90]
[91]
and to train his body into physical perfection
[90]
[91]
to fight crime in
Gotham City
as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.
[90]
[91]
He also speaks over 40 languages.
[92]
Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the "reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions".
[93]
The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.
[87]
Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a
dionysian
figure, a force for
anarchy
that imposes an individual order".
[94]
Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,
[95]
a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty
conscience
.
[96]
Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's characterization,
[97]
such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior. Batman, shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin, was changed in 1940 after DC editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical code, subsequently he was retconned to have a stringent moral code,
[33]
[98]
which has stayed with the character of Batman ever since. Miller's Batman was closer to the original pre-Robin version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary.
[99]
Others
On several occasions former Robin
Dick Grayson
has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010.
[59]
As part of DC's
2011 continuity relaunch
, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the
Flashpoint
crossover event.
In an interview with
IGN
, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and
Damian Wayne
as Robin represented a "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin". Morrison explained their intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the
Teen Titans
, and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; He's a lot looser and more relaxed."
[64]
Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence. Jean-Paul Valley, also known as
Azrael
, assumed the cowl after the events of the
Knightfall
saga.
[59]
Jim Gordon
donned a mecha-suit after the events of
Batman: Endgame
, and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016. In 2021, as part of the
Fear State
crossover event,
Lucius Fox
's son
Jace Fox
succeeds Bruce as Batman in a 2021 storyline, depicted in the series
I Am Batman
, after Batman was declared dead.
Additionally, members of the group
Batman Incorporated
, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world.
[59]
Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.
Supporting characters
Main article:
List of Batman supporting characters
Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.
[87]
Enemies
Main article:
List of Batman family enemies
Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.
[100]
These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's
rogues gallery
. Batman's "most implacable foe" is the
Joker
, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents "everything Batman [opposes]".
[34]
Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include
Catwoman
(a
cat burglar
anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic interest), the
Penguin
,
Ra's al Ghul
,
Two-Face
, the
Riddler
, the
Scarecrow
,
Mr. Freeze
,
Poison Ivy
,
Harley Quinn
,
Bane
,
Clayface
, and
Killer Croc
, among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at
Arkham Asylum
.
Allies
Alfred
Main article:
Alfred Pennyworth
Batman's butler,
Alfred Pennyworth
, first appeared in
Batman
#16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character "[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand" to the hero and his sidekick.
[100]
"Batman family"
The informal name "
Batman family
" is used for a group of characters closely allied with Batman, generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. Currently, the Batfamily consists of Jean-Paul Valley/Azrael, Michael Lane/Azrael, Barbara Gordon/Batgirl/Oracle, Cassandra Cain/Batgirl/Orphan, Stephanie Brown/Batgirl/Spoiler, Luke Fox/Batwing, Kate Kane/Batwoman, Harper Row/Bluebird, Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Minkhoa Khan/Ghost-Maker, Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn, Dick Grayson/Nightwing, Jason Todd/Red Hood, Damian Wayne/Robin, Tim Drake/Robin, and Duke Thomas/The Signal.
Civilians
Lucius Fox
, a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's clandestine vigilante activities (Lucius' son Luke would later become aware of Bruce's secret identity and adopt the superhero mantle of Batwing as well as become a member of the Justice League);
Dr. Leslie Thompkins
, a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity;
Vicki Vale
, an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the
Gotham Gazette
;
Ace the Bat-Hound
, Batman's canine partner who was mainly active in the 1950s and 1960s;
[101]
and
Bat-Mite
, an extra-dimensional imp mostly active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.

Gotham City Police Department
As Batman's ally in the Gotham City police,
Commissioner
James "Jim" Gordon
debuted along with Batman in
Detective Comics
#27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting
everyman
, he shares Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of
Dr. Watson
does in
Sherlock Holmes
stories, a normal person's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.
Justice League
Main article:
Justice League
Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the
Justice League of America
and the
Outsiders
. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of
World's Finest Comics
and
Superman/Batman
series. In Pre-
Crisis
continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In
Superman/Batman
#3 (December 2003),
Superman
observes, "Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."

Robin
Main article:
Robin (character)
Batman and
Robin
, art by
Jack Burnley
Robin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years; each iteration of the Robin character, of which there have been five in the mainstream continuity, function as members of the Batman family, but additionally, as Batman's "central" sidekick in various media.
[103]
Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking."
[104]
The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero
Nightwing
. A second Robin,
Jason Todd
, appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the
Red Hood
, and became an
antihero
vigilante with no qualms about using
firearms
or
deadly force
.
Carrie Kelley
, the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels
The Dark Knight Returns
and
The Dark Knight Strikes Again
, fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.
The third Robin in the mainstream comics is
Tim Drake
, who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by the
Red Robin
, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium,
Stephanie Brown
served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity the Spoiler, and later as
Batgirl
.
[105]
After Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to
Damian Wayne
, the 10-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and
Talia al Ghul
, in the late 2000s.
[106]
Damian's tenure as
du jour
Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of
Batman Incorporated
in 2013.
[107]
Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the
ornithological
theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of the
Bluebird
in 2014. Unlike the Robins, the Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun, albeit
non-lethal
; her weapon of choice is a modified rifle that fires taser rounds.
[108]
In 2015, a new series began titled
We Are...Robin
,
focused on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City. The most prominent of these, Duke Thomas, later becomes Batman's crimefighting partner as
The Signal
.
Relationships
Children
Throughout the character's history, Batman has had numerous adopted and biological children throughout the character's various interpretations and iterations. In the mainline DC Universe, Bruce is the adoptive father of Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, and Cassandra Cain, and the biological father of Damian Wayne, who is Bruce's son with his old lover Talia Al Ghul (the daughter of Bruce's ex-mentor and League of Assassins head
Ra's al Ghul
, thus making Ra's Damian's grandfather), all of whom Bruce trained to become and have followed his path as crimefighters. In addition to his legally adopted children, Bruce is also a surrogate father to proteges Duke Thomas and Stephanie Brown. Notable alternate universe biological children of Bruce's include
Helena Wayne
, the biological daughter of the Golden Age/Earth 2's
Bruce Wayne
and that universe's
Selina Kyle
, Terry and Matt McGuiness from the DC Animated Universe, and Ibn al Xu'ffasch from the
Kingdom Come
universe.
Damian Wayne
is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and
Talia al Ghul
,
[64]
[109]
[110]
and thus the grandson of
Ra's al Ghul
. Terry and Matt McGuiness were the result of an experiment created by the DCAU's Amanda Waller to create a new Batman to replace Bruce when he eventually became too old for the mantle. This was done by Waller and her team collecting Bruce's genetic material and having Terry and Matt's legal father Warren McGuiness experimentally alter his reproductive system to be identical to Batman's, which led to Terry and Matt genetically being Bruce's sons and Terry eventually becoming Bruce's successor as Batman during the events of the TV show
Batman Beyond
(though he did not discover his relation to Bruce until 15 years after they first met). Much like Damian, Ibn al Xu'ffasch is Bruce's son with Talia al Ghul, but unlike Damian, al Xu'ffasch did not learn about his connection to Bruce until adulthood.
Romantic interests
Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the "playboy" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being "Gotham's most eligible bachelor". Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically linked with many women throughout his various incarnations.
Batman's first romantic interest was
Julie Madison
in
Detective Comics
#31 (September 1939); however, their romance was short-lived. Some of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as
Julie Madison
,
Vicki Vale
, and
Silver St. Cloud
. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies and enemies such as
Kathy Kane (Batwoman)
,
Sasha Bordeaux
,
Zatanna
,
Wonder Woman
, and
Pamela Isley (Poison Ivy)
. His most significant relationships occurred with
Selina Kyle (Catwoman)
[111]
and
Talia al Ghul
; both women bore his biological offsprings,
Helena Wayne
and
Damian Wayne
, respectively.
Catwoman
Main article:
Catwoman
While most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short in duration,
Catwoman
has been his most enduring romance throughout the years.
[112]
The attraction between Batman and Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear, including a love story between their two secret identities as early as in the 1966 film
Batman
. Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection.
In an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as "Bruce". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during
The Long Halloween
. The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In
Batman: Dark Victory
, he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the 12-issue story arc called "
Hush
", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, "Hush" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire
rogues gallery
and rekindling their romantic relationship. In "Hush", Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.
The
Earth-Two Batman
, a character from a parallel world, partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Selina Kyle, as shown in
Superman Family
#211. They have a daughter named
Helena Wayne
, who becomes the Huntress. Along with Dick Grayson, the
Earth-Two Robin
, the Huntress takes the role as Gotham's protector once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.
Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on the roof of a building in
Catwoman
vol. 4 #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship.
[113]
Following the 2016
DC Rebirth
continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on top of a building in
Batman
vol. 3 #14 (2017).
[114]
Following the 2016
DC Rebirth
continuity reboot, Batman and Catwoman work together in the third volume of
Batman
. The two also have a romantic relationship, in which they are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop and sleeping together.
[114]
[115]
[116]
Bruce proposes to Selina in
Batman
vol. 3 #24 (2017),
[117]
and in issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again. When he does so, she says, "Yes."
[116]
Batman
vol. 3 Annual #2 (January 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death.
[116]
Abilities
Skills and training
Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess".
[28]
Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient
scientist
, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver.
[118]
Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical and mental conditioning.
[119]
As a
polymath
, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe. He has shown prowess in assorted fields such as mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, and several levels of engineering.
[120]
He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the
Superman: Doomed
story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.
[121]
Batman has trained extensively in various fighting styles, making him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe. He has fully utilized his
photographic memory
to master a total of 127 forms of martial arts including, but not limited to,
aikido
,
boxing
,
Brazilian jiu-jitsu
,
capoeira
,
eskrima
,
fencing
,
gatka
,
hapkido
,
Jeet Kune Do
,
judo
,
kalaripayattu
,
karate
,
kenjutsu
,
kenpō
,
kickboxing
,
kobudō
,
Krav Maga
,
kyūdō
,
bōjutsu
,
Muay Thai
,
ninjutsu
,
pankration
,
sambo
,
savate
,
silat
,
taekwondo
,
wrestling
, numerous styles of
Wushu (kung fu)
(such as
baguazhang
,
Chin Na
,
Hung Ga
,
Shaolinquan
,
tai chi
,
Wing Chun
), and
Yaw-Yan
.
[122]
In terms of his physical condition, Batman is described as peak human and far beyond an Olympic-athlete-level condition, able to perform feats such as easily running across rooftops in a
Parkour
-esque fashion, pressing thousands of pounds regularly, and even bench pressing six hundred pounds of soil and coffin in a poisoned and starved state. Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in
JLA
.
Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of
telepathy
and
mind control
. He is a master of
disguise
, multilingual, and an expert in
espionage
, often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and
escapology
, which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable
deathtraps
with little to no harm. He is also a master strategist, considered DC’s greatest tactician, with numerous plans in preparation for almost any eventuality.
Batman is an expert in
interrogation
techniques and his
intimidating
and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of
Superman
and
Wonder Woman
.
Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the
Batplane
), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he even underwent some magician training.
Technology
Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian
Les Daniels
credits
Gardner Fox
with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in
Detective Comics
#29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the
batarang
and the "Batgyro" in
Detective Comics
#31 and 32 (Sept. and October 1939).
[24]
Personal armor
Main article:
Batsuit
Batman's
batsuit
aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both
Kevlar
and
Nomex
. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts, and incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.
[123]
The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.
[124]
The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, "We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same ...Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it."
[125]
Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.
[123]
Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey;
[123]
as well as black and grey. In the
Tim Burton
's
Batman
and
Batman Returns
films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background.
Christopher Nolan
's
The Dark Knight Trilogy
depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle.
Ben Affleck
's Batman in the
DC Extended Universe
films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol. Seemingly following the suit of the DC Extended Universe outfit,
Robert Pattinson
's uniform in
The Batman
restores the more traditional gray bodysuit and black appendage design, notably different from prior iterations by mostly utilizing real world armor and apparel pieces from modern military and motorcycle gear.
Batmobile
Main article:
Batmobile
The 1966 television Batmobile, built by
George Barris
from a
Lincoln Futura
concept car
Batman's primary vehicle is the
Batmobile
, which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with
tailfins
that suggest a bat's wings.
Batman also has an aircraft called the
Batplane
(originally a relatively traditionally, but bat-motifed plane, later seen as the much more unique "Batwing" starting in
the 1989 film
), along with various other means of transportation.
In proper practice, the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s
Batman
live-action television show
and the
Super Friends
animated series) stretched the practice to
campy
proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a
Batboat
,
Bat-Sub
, and
Batcycle
, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such "bat-" names as the Bat-computer, Bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-
shark repellent
bat-spray, and Bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In
The Dark Knight Returns
, Batman tells
Carrie Kelley
that the original Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle.
The Batmobile, which was before frequently depicted to resemble a
sports car
, was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics
relaunched
its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.
Utility belt
Main article:
Batman's utility belt
Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his
utility belt
. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it.
Since
the 1989 film
, Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable (before this, a he employed a traditionally thrown grappling hook.) This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City.
An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are hand
guns
, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder. In modern stories in terms of his vehicles, Batman compromises on that principle to install weapon systems on them for the purpose of non-lethally disabling other vehicles, forcing entry into locations and attacking dangerous targets too large to defeat by other means.
Bat-Signal
Main article:
Bat-Signal
When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a
searchlight
with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.
In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s
Batman
TV series
, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence,
Wayne Manor
, specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.
Batcave
Main article:
Batcave
The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of caves beneath his mansion,
Wayne Manor
. As his command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman's unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on.
In both the comic book
Batman: Shadow of the Bat
#45 and the 2005 film
Batman Begins
, the cave is said to have been part of the
Underground Railroad
.
Fictional character biography
Batman's history has undergone many
retroactive continuity
revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character's history have varied greatly. Scholars
William Uricchio
and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."

The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's
origin story
.
[87]
As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr.
Thomas Wayne
and his wife
Martha
, murdered with a gun by a mugger named
Joe Chill
. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in
Gotham City
as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number",
[87]
a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.
[127]
Golden Age
See also:
Batman (Earth-Two)
In Batman's first appearance in
Detective Comics
#27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.
[128]
Batman's origin is first presented in
Detective Comics
#33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in
Batman
#47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable
Gotham City
socialites. Bruce is brought up in
Wayne Manor
, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named
Joe Chill
while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ..." As if responding to his desires, a
bat
suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.
[129]
In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fiancé named
Julie Madison
.
[130]
In
Detective Comics
#38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat,
Dick Grayson
, who becomes his vigilante partner,
Robin
. Batman also becomes a founding member of the
Justice Society of America
,
[131]
although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,
[132]
and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of
Gotham City's police department
.
[133]
During this time,
Alfred Pennyworth
arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.
[134]
Silver Age
The
Silver Age of Comic Books
in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced
Barry Allen
as a new, updated version of the
Flash
. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as
Earth-One
. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until
Detective Comics
#327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.
After the introduction of DC Comics'
Multiverse
in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the
Earth-Two Batman
, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman (Selina Kyle). The two have a daughter,
Helena Wayne
, who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the
Earth-Two Robin
, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles, however, often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike the Flash or
Green Lantern
, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age.
[135]
Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in
Batman
#208 (February 1969)) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.
[136]
[137]
In 1980, then-editor
Paul Levitz
commissioned the
Untold Legend of the Batman
miniseries
to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.
Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in
World's Finest Comics
, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the
Justice League
of America, Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's
The Brave and the Bold
#28. In the 1970s and 1980s,
The Brave and the Bold
became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different
DC Universe
superhero each month.
Bronze Age
In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion,
Wayne Manor
into a
penthouse apartment
atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. In 1974's "Night of the Stalker" storyline, a diploma on the wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of
Yale Law School
.
[138]
Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal
psychopath
, and the arrival of
Ra's al Ghul
, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes
Nightwing
.
[139]
In the final issue of
The Brave and the Bold
in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the
Outsiders
. He serves as the team's leader until
Batman and the Outsiders
#32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.
Modern Age
After the 12-issue
miniseries
Crisis on Infinite Earths
, DC Comics
retconned
the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline "
Year One
" from
Batman
#404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.
[140]
Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the Post-
Crisis
universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following
Crisis
, DC launched a new Batman title called
Legends of the Dark Knight
in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the "Year One" period.
[141]
Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crimefighting, a result of the pain of losing
Jason Todd
. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when
Tim Drake
becomes the new Robin.
[142]
Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been intertitle crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published "
Knightfall
". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask
Azrael
to take on the role. After the end of "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.
[143]
The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline
Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!
changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now consider Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.
Batman once again becomes a member of the
Justice League
during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled
JLA
. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's "
Cataclysm
" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "
No Man's Land
".
Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and
Harvey Bullock
are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the
sadistic
Black Mask
the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs.
Lex Luthor
arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper Lynd (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "
Bruce Wayne: Fugitive

is a version of Batman from Earth -22, a dark reflection of the Earth-22. In that reality, the Earth -22 Joker learned of Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne and killed most of Batman's other rogues along with Commissioner Gordon. He then subjected a sizeable population of Gotham's populace to the chemicals that transformed him, subsequently killing several parents in front of their children with the goal of turning them into essentially a combination of himself and Batman. When Batman grappled with the Joker, it resulted in the latter's death as Batman is exposed to a purified form of the chemicals that gradually turned him into a new Joker, the process proving irreversible by the time Batman discovered what was happening to him. The Batman who Laughs proceeded to take over Earth-22, killing off most of his allies and turning Damian into a mini-Joker. The Batman Who Laughs seems to be the de facto leader or second-in-command of Barbatos' Dark Knights and recruited the other members. After arriving on Prime-Earth, the Batman Who Laughs takes control of Gotham and oversees events at the Challenger's mountain. He distributes joker cards to the Batman's Rogues, giving them the ability to alter reality and take over sections of the city. Accompanying him are Damian and three other youths whom he also calls his sons, all four being twisted versions of Robin, having intended to destroy all of reality by linking the Over-Monitor to Anti-Monitor's astral brain. But The Batman Who Laughs is defeated when the Prime Universe Batman is aided by the Joker, who notes the alternate Batman's failure to perceive this scenario due to still being a version of Batman. While assumed dead, the Batman who Laughs is revealed to be in the custody of Lex Luthor who offers him a place in the Legion of Doom.

He knocks Barry out and ties him to the Batmobile, which has a machine created from reverse-engineering the Cosmic Treadmill attached to it. Using this machine against Barry's wishes, Bruce drove straight into the Speed Force while absorbing Barry in the process. Scarred by the ordeal, he developed a split personality created from residual traces of the Earth -52 Barry's mind. The newly-born Red Death tests his new powers but realizes he cannot stop his Earth from its destruction until he is recruited by The Batman Who Laughs, who promises him a new Earth to live upon. After entering Prime-Earth, the Red Death arrives in Central City and is confronted by Iris West and Wally West, during which he uses his powers to slow Wally and age them both.

Bruce then entered his giant Green Lantern Power Battery and exits with a new outfit and moniker, the Dawnbreaker.

While Aquawoman claimed her people came in peace, a skeptical Bryce declared war on Atlantis with the Atlanteans flooding Gotham in retaliation when their queen was killed. Bryce survived the disaster by performing auto-surgery on herself by introducing mutated hybrid DNA into her body, giving Bryce the ability to breath underwater, accelerated healing, and water manipulation. She also created an army of Dead Waters to fight for her. Donning a new attire, Bryce called herself The Drowned and successfully conquered Atlantis at the cost of flooding every city. After seeing her signal being lit, the Drowned met the Batman Who Laughs, who recruits her as a Dark Knight. After arriving on Earth-0, the Drowned headed to Amnesty Bay, where she was confronted by Aquaman and Mera.

Injustice: Gods Among Us
In
Injustice: Gods Among Us
, Batman was originally close friends with Superman (with Superman even asking him to be godfather to his child with Lois Lane) but when Superman was tricked by the Joker into killing Lois and destroying Metropolis, their relationship slowly went from estranged to antagonistic to enemies. Superman begins a new world order where he and the Justice League use brute force and fear to coerce people into following the law, but Batman sees the tyranny in this and opposes Superman's Regime with his Insurgency. He suffers a few losses, notably of Dick Grayson by the hands of his biological son Damian (albeit by accident), who sided with Superman. By the end of Year One Superman breaks Batman's back in an attempt to delay any future defiance. During most of Year Two Batman is out of commission, relying on his allies to stop the Regime when the Green Lantern Corps gets involved. In Year Three Batman allies himself with magic-users, notably John Constantine, though this ends with Constantine revealed to have been using Batman to further his own goals. Year Four has Batman look to the Greek gods to stop Superman. However, he comes to regret this when the gods decide to overpower humanity themselves, leading him to enlist the New God Highfather to stop them. He evades a trap set up by Superman when the fallen hero tries to make a meeting to discuss their problems. By the game's events, Batman has suffered many losses by the hands of the Regime and in a last-ditch effort summons the counterparts of Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, and Aquaman from the mainstream universe, needing them to help him retrieve a shard of kryptonite from his now-abandoned Batcave; the kryptonite was meant to be a last resort for if Superman went rogue, but Batman made it he could only access it if key members of the League agreed. Since most of them allied with Superman who are dead (Green Arrow) he needed duplicates. When this plan fails, he is reluctant to bring over the mainstream Superman, convinced that any version of Superman is corruptible. However, his prime counterpart convinces him to have faith and he does so, with the mainstream Superman defeating his counterpart and ending the Regime's influence.

, Bruce has grown up believing he is a descendant of Edmond Wayne, the founder of Gotham City and Wayne Enterprises. In reality, though, he is actually a descendant of Bakkar, a disgraced former member of the Order of St. Dumas, who murdered Edmond Wayne and assumed his identity. Jean-Paul Valley, a.k.a. Azrael, is actually the real Wayne descendant, which Bruce only learns from Jack Napier right before Jack forces Harley Quinn to kill him as the Joker will not let him kill himself.
[202]
After helping save the city from the plotting of Neo-Joker to destroy Gotham, he hands over the keys to his various Batmobiles to the GCPD Gotham Terrorism Oppression unit and unmasks himself in front of Gordon to earn back his trust after the ordeal.
[203]
He later turns himself in after incapacitating Azrael in combat for his many unintentional crimes while Batman.
[204]
During his trial, he and Harleen Quinzel married on her suggestion to keep her from testifying against him, resulting in him becoming stepfather to hers and Jack's children. After 12 years in prison, he helps stop a riot, but upon hearing that
someone
has stolen a prototype Batsuit and is going around as Batman, he escapes with Jason Todd's help and heads into the city, aided by a sentient AI program of Jack (from a chip placed in his head before). Aided by commissioner Barbara Gordon and Duke Thomas, Bruce encounters the new Batman, and finds out more about the plans of Derek Powers, who he reveals was responsible for building his Batman gear before taking over Wayne Enterprises. In the end, Bruce teas up with Terry, the GCPD, and the GTO unit led by Dick Grayson into attacking the company headquarters to stop Powers' plan to illegally sell Bat-mechas across the planet. After that succeeds, Bruce is approached by FBI agents Diana Prince and John Stewart, who offer to change his sentence to time served in exchange for his help in investigating reports of a
flying teenager
in Kansas.
[205]
Cultural impact and legacy
Batman has become a
pop culture
icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989
Batman
film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness".
[206]
In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character,
The Guardian
wrote, "Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for the 21st century."
[207]
In other media
Main article:
Batman (franchise)
Adam West
as Batman in the
1960s TV series
.
The character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books, such as newspaper syndicated
comic strips
, books, radio dramas, television, a
stage show
, and several theatrical
feature films
. The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943.
[208]
That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part
serial
Batman
, with
Lewis Wilson
becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearances in
The Adventures of Superman
, starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor
Bud Collyer
needed time off.
[209]
A second movie serial,
Batman and Robin
, followed in 1949, with
Robert Lowery
taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s "helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book".
[209]
In the 1964 publication of
Donald Barthelme
's collection of short stories
Come Back, Dr. Caligari
, Barthelme wrote "The Joker's Greatest Triumph". Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.
[210]
Television
The
Batman
television series, starring
Adam West
, premiered in January 1966 on the
ABC
television network. Inflected with a
camp
sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir,
Back to the Batcave
, West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a
farce
or
lampoon
, and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the
Batman
television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film
Batman
(1966).
The Who
recorded the theme song from the
Batman
show for their 1966 EP
Ready Steady Who
, and
the Kinks
performed the theme song on their 1967 album
Live at Kelvin Hall
. Adam West also appeared in character as Batman in several commercials and a 1966 US Government PSA for Savings Bonds.
[211]
Despite not having an immediate continuation, the series spawned a (failed)
pilot episode
for a
spin-off
Batgirl
television series and, decades later, the
Batman '66
(2013-2016) comic book series, the animated films
Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders
(2016) and
Batman vs. Two-Face
(2017), and even the
mockumentary
Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt
(2003).
In the 1996 episode
Heroes and Villains
of
Only Fools and Horses
,
David Jason
spoofed the role of Batman.
[212]
The popularity of the
Batman
TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in
The Batman/Superman Hour
;
[213]
the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as
The Adventures of Batman
and
Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder
which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's
Super Friends
series, which was animated by
Hanna-Barbera
.
Olan Soule
was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during
Super Friends
by Adam West, who also voiced the character in
Filmation
's 1977 series
The New Adventures of Batman
.
Batman as depicted in the
1990s animated series
.
In 1992,
Batman: The Animated Series
premiered on the
Fox
television network, produced by
Warner Bros. Animation
and featuring
Kevin Conroy
as the voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker tone, mature writing, stylistic design, and thematic complexity compared to previous superhero cartoons,
[214]
[215]
in addition to multiple
Emmy Awards
.
[216]
[217]
The series' success led to the theatrical film
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm
(1993),
[218]
as well as various
spin-off
TV series that included
Superman: The Animated Series
,
The New Batman Adventures
,
Justice League
and
Justice League Unlimited
(each of which also featured Conroy as Batman's voice). The futuristic series
Batman Beyond
also took place in this same animated continuity and featured a newer, younger
Batman
voiced by
Will Friedle
, with the elderly Bruce Wayne (again voiced by Conroy) as a mentor.
In 2004, an unrelated animated series titled
The Batman
made its debut with
Rino Romano
voicing Batman. In 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series,
Batman: The Brave and the Bold
, featuring
Diedrich Bader
's voice as Batman. In 2013, a new
CGI
-animated series titled
Beware the Batman
made its debut, with
Anthony Ruivivar
voicing Batman.
[219]
In 2014, the live-action TV series
Gotham
premiered on the Fox network, featuring
David Mazouz
as a 12-year-old Bruce Wayne. In 2018, when the series was renewed for its fifth and final season it was announced that Batman would make an appearance in the series finale's flash-forward.
Iain Glen
portrays Bruce Wayne in the live-action series
Titans
, appearing in the show's second season in 2019.
[220]
Prior to Glen, Batman was played by stunt doubles
Alain Moussi
and Maxim Savarias in the first season.
[221]
[222]
To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television
short film
,
Batman: Strange Days
, that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel.
In August 2019, it was announced that Kevin Conroy would make his live-action television debut as an older Bruce Wayne in the upcoming
Arrowverse
crossover,
Crisis on Infinite Earths
.
[223]
In the crossover, he portrayed a parallel universe iteration of Batman from
Earth-99
. In
Batwoman
, the
Earth-Prime
version of Bruce Wayne / Batman is portrayed by
Warren Christie
.
[224]
In May 2021, it was announced that a new animated series titled
Batman: Caped Crusader
was in development by
Bruce Timm
(co-creator of
Batman: The Animated Series
),
JJ Abrams
, and
Matt Reeves
. The series is said to be a reimagining of the Caped Crusader that returns to the character's noir roots.
[225]
Film
Main article:
Batman in film
Michael Keaton
as
Batman
in the
1989 film
.
As previously stated, Batman's first cinematic appearances consisted of the 1943
serial film
Batman
and its 1949 sequel
Batman and Robin
, which were both released by
Columbia Pictures
and depicted a government-backed version of Batman and Robin (censorship at the time would not have allowed for
vigilantes
to be depicted as unauthorized crimefighters). The serials (especially the first one) are, though, notorious for their accentuation on
anti-Japanese sentiments
due to their
World War II
-period setting. In 1966,
20th Century Fox
released Batman's first feature-length film, titled
Batman
(also advertised as
Batman: The Movie
), based on and featuring most of the cast from the 1960s TV series.
Burton/Schumacher series
In 1989,
Warner Bros.
released the feature film
Batman
, directed by
Tim Burton
and starring
Michael Keaton
as
the title character
. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history.
[226]
The film also won the
Academy Award for Best Art Direction
.
[227]
The film's success spawned three sequels:
Batman Returns
(1992),
Batman Forever
(1995) and
Batman & Robin
(1997), the latter two of which were directed by
Joel Schumacher
instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with
Val Kilmer
and
George Clooney
, respectively. The second Schumacher film failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned, causing Warner Bros. to cancel the planned fourth sequel,
Batman Unchained
,
[228]
and end the initial film series. The first two films later became the basis for the Burton-inspired comic book series
Batman '89
(2021).
[229]
Keaton would later reprise his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman for the 2023 film,
The Flash
.
[230]
The Dark Knight Trilogy
In 2005,
Batman Begins
was released by Warner Bros. as a
reboot
of the film series, directed by
Christopher Nolan
and starring
Christian Bale
as
Batman
. Its sequel,
The Dark Knight
(2008), set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend of all time in the U.S., earning approximately $158 million,
[231]
and became the fastest film to reach the $400 million mark in the history of American cinema (eighteenth day of release).
[232]
These record-breaking attendances saw
The Dark Knight
end its run as the second-highest domestic grossing film (at the time) with $533 million, bested then only by
Titanic
.
[233]
The film also won two Academy Awards, including
Best Supporting Actor
for the late
Heath Ledger
.
[234]
It was eventually followed by
The Dark Knight Rises
(2012), which served as a conclusion to Nolan's film series that has since been known as
The Dark Knight Trilogy
.
Animated films
Since 2008, Batman has also starred in various direct-to-video films under the
DC Universe Animated Original Movies
label.
Kevin Conroy

Jeremy Sisto
,
William Baldwin
,
Bruce Greenwood
,
Ben McKenzie
,
Peter Weller
, and
Jensen Ackles
.
[235]
In the direct-to-video films of the
DC Animated Movie Universe
, Batman was voiced by Kevin Conroy again in
Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox
(2013) and by
Jason O'Mara
in all subsequent films, such as
The Death of Superman
(2018) and
Batman: Hush
(2019). A
Lego
-themed version of Batman was also featured as one of the protagonists in the theatrically-released animated film
The Lego Movie
(2014), with
Will Arnett
providing the voice.
[236]
Arnett reprised the voice role for the spin-off film
The Lego Batman Movie
(2017),
[237]
as well as for the sequel
The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part
(2019).

[272]
Interpretations
Gay interpretations
Further information:
Homosexuality in the Batman franchise
Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist
Fredric Wertham
asserted in
Seduction of the Innocent
in 1954 that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual ...The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious."
[273]
Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay "Batman, Deviance, and Camp" that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because "he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality".
[274]
Professor of film and cultural studies
Will Brooker
argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character.
[275]
In 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of
watercolors
depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses,
[276]
prompting DC to threaten legal action.
[277]
Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, "The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay ...everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane ...none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view."
[278]
Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he is "borderline pathological", concluding "He'd be much healthier if he
were
gay."
[279]
Grant Morrison
said that "Gayness is built into Batman ...Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay."
[280]
Psychological interpretations
This section

(
April 2019
)
Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of interpretations into the character's psyche.
In
Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight
, Dr. Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists
Carl Jung
and
Joseph Campbell
is present in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the "shadow archetype". This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil. Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our "shadow selves".
[281]
[282]
Langley also taught a class called Batman, a title he was adamant about. "I could have called it something like the Psychology of Nocturnal Vigilantism, but no. I called it Batman," Langley says.
[283]
Several psychologists have explored Bruce Wayne/Batman's mental health. Robin. S. Rosenberg evaluated his actions and problems to determine if they reach the level of mental disorders. She examined the possibility of several mental health issues, including
dissociative identity disorder
,
obsessive-compulsive disorder
, and several others. She concluded that Bruce Wayne/Batman may have a disorder or a combination of disorders but due to his fictional nature, a definitive diagnosis will remain unknown.
[284]
[285]
[286]
However, Langley himself states in his book that Batman is far too functional and well-adjusted, due to his training, confrontation of his fear early on and other factors, to be mentally ill. More likely, he asserts Batman's mental attitude is far more in line with a dedicated Olympic athlete.

Deadpool
is a
character
appearing in
American comic books
published by
Marvel Comics
. Created by
Fabian Nicieza
and
Rob Liefeld
, the character first appeared in
New Mutants
#98 (December 1990). In his comic book appearances, Deadpool is initially depicted as a
supervillain
of the
New Mutants
and
X-Force
, though later stories would portray him as an
antihero
. Deadpool is the
alter ego
of
Wade Wilson
, a disfigured Canadian
mercenary
with
superhuman
regenerative
healing abilities. He is known for his tendency to joke incessantly and break the
fourth wall
for humorous effect.
The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series
Cable & Deadpool
, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "
Ryan Renolds
[
sic
] crossed with a
Shar-Pei
".
[6]
[7]
Reynolds himself would eventually portray the
character
in the
X-Men
film series
, appearing in
X-Men Origins: Wolverine
(2009),
Deadpool
(2016), and its sequel
Deadpool 2
(2018).
[8]
[9]
[10]
Reynolds attributes
Cable & Deadpool
#2 to what got him invested in the character and inspired him to bring the character to the movies.
[11]
He will continue playing the character in
Deadpool 3
(2024), set in the
Marvel Cinematic Universe
.

Publication history
Further information:
List of Deadpool titles
1990s
Created by artist/writer
Rob Liefeld
and writer
Fabian Nicieza
,
[13]
[14]
[15]
Deadpool made his first appearance in the pages of
The New Mutants
#98
cover dated
Feb. 1991.
[16]
According to Nicieza, Liefeld came up with the character's visual design and name, and Nicieza himself came up with the character's speech mannerisms.
[17]
Liefeld's favorite comic title before
X-Men
was
Avengers
, which featured weapons like
Captain America's shield
,
Thor's hammer
and
Hawkeye
's bow and arrow. Because of this, he decided to give weapons to his new characters as well.
[18]
Liefeld, also a fan of the
Teen Titans
comics, showed his new character to then-writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is
Deathstroke
from Teen Titans". Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.
[19]
Other inspirations were
Spider-Man
,
Wolverine
and
Snake Eyes
. Liefeld states: "Wolverine and Spider-Man were the two properties I was competing with at all times. I didn't have those, I didn't have access to those. I had to make my own Spider-Man and Wolverine. That's what
Cable
and Deadpool were meant to be, my own Spider-Man and my own Wolverine."
[20]
"
G.I. Joe
was my first obsession. Those were the toys in the sandbox with me, kung fu grip, eagle eye, I had them all.
G.I. Joe
is a world of characters that I have always aspired to participate in. Snake Eyes was a profound influence on my creating Deadpool."
[21]
Both Deadpool and Cable were also meant to be tied into Wolverine's history already from the start, as Liefeld describes: "Wolverine was my guy. If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning." Like Wolverine, Deadpool is (or is thought to be) Canadian.
[22]
[23]
The original story had him joining the
Weapon X
program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine's thanks to Dr.
Emrys Killebrew
, one of the head scientists.
[24]
The character's co-creator,
Rob Liefeld
, holding up a copy of
New Mutants
#98, in which the character first appeared, during an appearance at JHU Comics in Manhattan held three days before the release of the film
Deadpool
In his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by
Tolliver
to attack Cable and the
New Mutants
. After subsequently appearing in
X-Force
as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as
The Avengers
,
Daredevil
, and
Heroes for Hire
. In 1993, the character received his own
miniseries
, titled
The Circle Chase
, written by
Fabian Nicieza
and pencilled by
Joe Madureira
. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by
Mark Waid
, pencilled by
Ian Churchill
, and inked by
Jason Temujin Minor
and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, "Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it. Someone who hasn't paid for their crimes presents a problem for me."
[25]
In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, the first volume of
Deadpool
.
Deadpool
became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother
Blind Al
and his best friend
Weasel
. The ongoing series gained
cult popularity
for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained.
2000s
Deadpool
lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title with a similar character called
Agent X
in 2002. This occurred during a line-wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with
Cable
becoming
Soldier X
and
X-Force
becoming
X-Statix
. It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the supervillain
Black Swan
. Deadpool's manager
Sandi Brandenberg
later founded Agency X with a mysterious man called Alex Hayden, who took the name dubbed
Agent X
. Deadpool later returned to the series, which would conclude with issues 13-15.
[26]
[

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of
Cable & Deadpool
written by
Fabian Nicieza
, where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy,
Cable
, teaming up in various adventures. This title was cancelled with issue #50 and replaced by a new
Cable
series in March 2008.
[27]
Deadpool then appeared briefly in the
Wolverine: Origins
title by writer
Daniel Way
before Way and Paco Medina launched another
Deadpool
title in September 2008.
[28]
Medina was the main series artist, with Carlo Barberi filling in on the first issue after the "
Secret Invasion
" tie-in.
[29]
A new
Deadpool
ongoing series
began as a
Secret Invasion
tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the
Skrull
queen
Veranke
.
[30]
[31]
Norman Osborn
steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. The story also sees the return of
Bob, Agent of HYDRA
. This all led directly to a confrontation with the new
Thunderbolts
in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between
Deadpool
vol. 2 #8-9 and
Thunderbolts
#130-131.
[32]
In
Deadpool
#15, Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like
Spider-Man
[33]
(who he had recently encountered in
The Amazing Spider-Man
#611 as part of "
The Gauntlet
"
[34]
) and leading to a 3-issue arc where he takes on
Hit-Monkey
,
[35]
a character who debuted in the same month in a digital, then-print, one-shot.
[36]
[37]
Another ongoing Deadpool series,
Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth
launched in July 2009, written by
Victor Gischler
, with art by Bong Dazo. In it Deadpool teams with Headpool from
Marvel Zombies 3
and
4
.
[38]
[39]
[40]
A special anniversary issue titled
Deadpool
#900 was released in October 2009. A third Deadpool ongoing series,
Deadpool Team-Up
, launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by
Fred Van Lente
, with art by Dalibor Talajic. This series features Deadpool teaming up with different heroes from the Marvel Universe in each issue, such as
Hercules
.
[41]
Deadpool also joined the cast of the new
Uncanny X-Force
team.
[42]
2010s
Another Deadpool series by Gischler titled
Deadpool Corps
was released in April 2010. Besides Deadpool himself, this series featured alternate versions of Deadpool, including Lady Deadpool (who debuted in
Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth
#7),
Headpool
(the
Marvel Zombies
universe incarnation, now reduced to a severed head), and two new characters; Kidpool, a child, and Dogpool, a dog.
[43]
The series lasted twelve issues.
Marvel also published
Deadpool
titles through the
Marvel Knights
and
MAX
imprints:
Deadpool: Wade Wilson's War
, by
Duane Swierczynski
and
Jason Pearson
,
[44]
[45]
[46]
and
Deadpool MAX
by
David Lapham
and
Kyle Baker
.
[47]
Deadpool vol. 2 was written by
Daniel Way
and drawn by
Alé Garza
. In the story arc "DEAD", Wade is "cured" of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face once again. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he suppresses his desires in order to protect his friend and
sidekick
Hydra Bob
.
[48]
After he loses his healing factor, Wilson claims he felt "more alive than ever."
[
]
However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help from
Taskmaster
in training.
[
]
Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually, he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.
[
]
Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process, his face was burned and disfigured again.
[
]
Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and
Slayback
and trained them to kill Deadpool.
[49]
[50]
Deadpool infiltrated their base and managed to get T-Ray and Slayback killed when Kemp was about to kill herself in an explosion which would kill Wade in the process, he convinced her not to attack him. At that moment, he was surprised by the returned Evil Deadpool, who informed Wade that the serum they took was not permanent, the reason why Wade's face did not heal or a finger he lost grew back, so Wade would return after Evil Deadpool shot him.
[51]
Daniel Way's Deadpool series concluded with issue 63.
As part of Marvel's
Marvel NOW!
initiative, a new
Deadpool
ongoing series was launched.
[52]
He is also a member of the
Thunderbolts
.
[53]
In the 27th issue of his new series, as part of "All-New Marvel NOW!", Deadpool was married for the third time. Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the webcomic
Deadpool: The Gauntlet
to be
Shiklah, Queen of the Undead
. Deadpool also discovers that he has a daughter by the name of Eleanor from a former flame of Deadpool named Carmelita.
[54]
During the events of "
Original Sin
", it was revealed that Deadpool was tricked into killing his parents by a scientist known as Butler (who abducted Eleanor and gave her to his brother), however, Deadpool does not know about it.
[55]
Much later, he clashed with
Carnage
, believing the universe was telling the latter to defeat him. After several fights and getting torn to pieces, Deadpool bonds with four symbiotes: Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony. Playing mind games, Deadpool tricked
Shriek
by using his shapeshifting abilities to make her disoriented and having her flee. After the symbiotic Deadpool and Carnage fought again, Deadpool captures Shriek and forces her to impersonate himself, making it trick Carnage into almost killing her in the process. Feeling broken after a mental breakdown, Carnage allowed himself to be arrested and was placed in an unlocked cell. While sitting in the cell until he was his own self, Carnage swore vengeance on Deadpool. Deadpool, after defeating Carnage, gives the four symbiotes to a war dog who helped Deadpool fight Carnage to deliver them to the government.
[56]
During the "
AXIS
" storyline, Deadpool appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against
Red Skull
's
Red Onslaught
form.
[57]
The group of villains becomes inverted to heroes, after a spell cast by Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom.
[
]
This group was later named the Astonishing Avengers.
[58]
This Deadpool, referred to as "Zenpool" was pivotal in turning Apocalypse to fighting the Inverted Avengers.
[59]
Deadpool's death occurs in
Deadpool
#250.
[60]
Deadpool faces off in a final showdown with
ULTIMATUM
and
Flag-Smasher
, killing all of them, and gives up the "Deadpool" identity, wishing to have a better life. He, along with his family and friends, (
and presumably everyone on Earth
) are all killed when the Earth
collides with an alternate universe's Earth
. Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.
[61]
All New, All Different Marvel
Eight months after the events of
Secret Wars
and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for
Steve Rogers
. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing
Rogue
, he is offered membership in the
Avengers Unity Squad
.
[62]
Deadpool
Vol. 4 began in 2016.
[

In the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from the merchandise.
[63]
Madcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface world sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.
[64]
Not long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterward, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.
[65]
Characterization
Personality
Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character.
[66]
He commonly breaks the
fourth wall
, which is done by few other characters in the
Marvel Universe
, and this is used to humorous effect, for instance, by having Deadpool converse with his own "inner monologue", represented by caption boxes. In stories by writer
Daniel Way
between 2008 and 2012, Deadpool was, without explanation, shown to have developed a second "voice in his head", represented by a second set of captions with a different font;
Deadpool
vol. 3 Annual #1 (2014) would
retroactively explain
that this voice belonged to
Madcap
, a psychotic
Captain America
villain, who had become molecularly entangled with Deadpool.
[67]
The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative, he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses,
T-Ray
, claims in
Deadpool
#33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.
[68]
There have been other dubious stories about his history—at one point the supervillain
Loki
claimed to be his father.
[5]
Frequently, revelations are later
retconned
or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether or not he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers.
[69]
Deadpool is depicted as having a regenerative healing factor, which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his
neurons
are also affected by the accelerated regeneration. It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent.
Taskmaster
, who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation, was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.
[70]
Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.
[70]
[71]
Deadpool has sometimes been portrayed to have a strong sense of core morality. In
Uncanny X-Force
, he storms out after
Wolverine
tries to rationalize
Fantomex
killing
Apocalypse
, who was at the time in a child form. After Wolverine argues that Deadpool is motivated solely by money,
Archangel
reveals that Deadpool never cashed any of his checks.
[72]
Sexual orientation
In December 2013, Deadpool was confirmed as being
pansexual
by
Deadpool
writer Gerry Duggan via Twitter.
[73]
However, this post on Twitter has since been deleted by Gerry Duggan. When asked about Deadpool's sexuality, co-creator Fabian Nicieza stated, "Deadpool is whatever sexual inclination his brain tells him he is in THAT moment. And then the moment passes."
[74]
Nicieza has also stated,
Not trying to be dismissive, but readers always want to 'make a character their own', and often that is to the exclusion of what the character might mean to other fans. I've been dogged with the DP sexuality questions for YEARS. It is a bit tiring. He is NO sex and ALL sexes. He is yours and everyone else's. So not dismissive, but rather the epitome of inclusive.
[75]
Powers and abilities
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. The speed of his healing factor depends on the severity of the wound and Deadpool's mental state. It works most efficiently when he is awake, alert, and in good spirits.
[76]
Deadpool's accelerated healing factor is strong enough that he has survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once.
[
citation needed
]
Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal a decapitation wound,
[77]
[78]
[79]
he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the
Hulk
in the graphic novel
Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe
.
[
]
Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying
neurons
being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers,
[80]
[81]
although this ability is inconsistent.
[82]
[83]
It has been revealed that at the time his healing ability was given to him, Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer; after the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.
[
]
Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his accelerated healing factor. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.
[84]
He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage.
[
citation needed
]
Unlike Wolverine, whose wounds sometimes cause excruciating pain as they heal depending on the severity, Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity.
[85]
Deadpool is effectively
immortal
, although he has died several times.
[86]
[87]
He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him.
[88]
In addition,
Thanos
once declared that Deadpool should "consider yourself cursed
... with life!" out of jealousy over Deadpool's status as
Death
's love interest.
[89]
His enemy T-Ray later resurrected him,
[86]
under Thanos' instruction, using an artifact he had given him.
[89]
Later, Deadpool was informed that Thanos had placed a curse on him, and tracked Thanos down. He revealed that the only thing keeping Wade alive was his "spell of darkest necromancy". Although Thanos removed this curse in order to kill Deadpool, he felt forced to immediately bring him back using "a fusion of necromancy and science" in order to request his aid in tracking down Mistress Death, who had gone missing.
[90]
Deadpool is a highly trained
assassin
and
mercenary
. He is adept in multiple forms of
martial arts
, including
Savate
.
[91]
Deadpool is an extraordinary athlete, and an expert swordsman and marksman. He is skilled in the use of multiple weapons, including
katanas
, knives, grenades, and guns. His accelerated healing factor may contribute to his abilities, allowing him to perform the intense exercise for extended periods of time with minimal aches and fatigue.

Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe
In the storyline
Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe
, the X-Men send Deadpool to a mental hospital for therapy. The doctor treating him is actually
Psycho-Man
in disguise, who attempts to torture and brainwash Deadpool into becoming his personal minion. The procedure fails but leaves Deadpool even more mentally unhinged, erasing the "serious" and "Screwball" voices in his head and replacing them with a voice that only wants destruction. Under "Evil Voice's" influence, Deadpool develops a more nihilistic world view and as a result, after killing Psycho-Man by repeatedly smashing him against a desk, (and after he burns the hospital by using gasoline) he begins assassinating every superhero and supervillain on Earth, starting with the
Fantastic Four
and even killing the Watcher, in an apparent attempt to rebel against his comic book creators. The book ends with him breaking into the "real" world and confronting the Marvel writers and artists who are writing the book. He says to the reader that once he is done with this universe, "I'll find you soon enough."

Wade reveals he and Shiklah had a falling out after the death of Ellie, which led to a battle between the two former lovers in Hell.
[114]
The new Deadpool is also being pursued by a woman who wears a costume that looks like Wade's "Zenpool" identity from Axis.

After Wade, Preston, and Ellie defeat Warda, Wade tells her that he and Shiklah had an on-and-off-again relationship, but were always on the path for war which eventually resulted in her death, as on Earth, those who refuse to co-exist cease to exist (with Wade bringing up the Skrulls to support his point). He implants Preston into Warda's head so she can aid Warda in clearing her conscious and becoming a better person and tells his daughters that they can both be Deadpool.

Father
Thored, Earl of Southern Northumbria
Ælfgifu of York
(fl. c. 970 - 1002) was the first wife of
Æthelred the Unready
,
King of the English
; as such, she was
Queen of the English
from their marriage in the 980s until her death in 1002. They had many children together, including
Edmund Ironside
. It is most probable that Ælfgifu was a daughter of
Thored
, Earl of southern Northumbria and his wife, Hilda.
Identity and background
[
edit
]
Her name and paternity do not surface in the sources until sometime after the Conquest. The first to offer any information at all,
Sulcard
of Westminster (
fl
. 1080s), merely describes her as being “of very noble English stock” (
ex nobilioribus Anglis
), without naming her,
[1]
while in the early 12th century,
William of Malmesbury
has nothing to report. All primary evidence comes from two Anglo-Norman historians.
John of Worcester
, also writing in the early 12th century, states that Æthelred's first wife was Ælfgifu, daughter of the nobleman Æthelberht (
comes Agelberhtus
) and the mother of Edmund, Æthelstan, Eadwig and Eadgyth.
[2]
Writing in the 1150s,
Ailred of Rievaulx
identifies her as a daughter of earl (
comes
)
Thored
and the mother of Edmund, though he supplies no name.
[3]
Ailred had been
seneschal
at the court of King
David I of Scotland
(r. 1124-53), whose mother
Margaret
was a great-granddaughter of Ælfgifu. Although his testimony is late, his proximity to the royal family may have given him access to genuine information.
[4]
Problem of fatherhood
[
edit
]
These two accounts are irreconcilable at the point of ascribing two different fathers to Æthelred's first wife (in both cases, Edmund's mother). One way out of it would be to assume the existence of two different wives before the arrival of Queen
Emma
, Æthelred's Norman wife, although this interpretation presents difficulties of its own, especially as the sources envisage a single woman.
[5]
Historians generally favour the view that John of Worcester was in error about the father's name, as Æthelberht's very existence is under suspicion:
[6]
if Latin
comes
is to be interpreted as a gloss on the office of
ealdorman
, only two doubtful references to one or two
duces
(ealdormen) of this name can be put forward that would fit the description.
[7]
All in all, the combined evidence suggests that Æthelred's first wife was Ælfgifu, the daughter of Earl Thored. This magnate is likely to have been the
Thored
who was a son of Gunnar and earl of (southern) Northumbria.
[8]
Marriage and children
[
edit
]
Based largely on the careers of her sons, Ælfgifu's marriage has been dated approximately to the (mid-)980s.
[8]
Considering Thored's authority as earl of York and apparently, the tenure of that office without royal appointment, the union would have signified an important step for the West-Saxon royal family by which it secured a foothold in the north.
[9]
Such a politically weighty union would help explain the close connections maintained by Ælfgifu's eldest sons Edmund and Æthelstan with noble families based in the northern Danelaw.
[10]
The marriage produced six sons, all of whom were named after Æthelred's predecessors, and an unknown number of daughters. The eldest sons Æthelstan, Ecgberht, Eadred and Edmund first attest charters in 993, while the younger sons Eadwig and Edgar first make an appearance in them in 997 and 1001 respectively.
[11]
Some of these sons seem to have spent part of their childhood in fosterage elsewhere, possibly with Æthelred's mother
Ælfthryth
.
[12]
Edmund Ironside outlived his father and became king. In 1016 he suffered several defeats against
Cnut
and in October they agreed to share the kingdom, but Edmund died within six weeks and Cnut became king of all England. Æthelred gave three of his daughters in marriage to ealdormen, presumably in order to secure the loyalties of his nobles and so to consolidate a defence system against Viking attacks.
[13]
Sons
[
edit
]
Æthelstan Ætheling
(born before 993, d. 1014)
Ecgberht
(born before 993, d. 1005)
Edmund (II) Ironside
(born before 993, d. 1016)
Eadred
(d. 1012 x 1015)
Eadwig
(born before 997, exiled and killed 1017)
Edgar
(born before 1001, d. 1012 x 1015)
Daughters
[
edit
]
Eadgyth (born before 993), married
Eadric Streona
, ealdorman of Mercia.
[14]
Ælfgifu, married ealdorman
Uhtred
of Northumbria.
[15]
(possibly) Wulfhild, who married
Ulfcytel (Snillingr)
(d. 1016), apparently ealdorman of East Anglia.
[16]
possibly an unnamed daughter who married the Æthelstan who was killed fighting the Danes at the Battle of Ringmere in 1010. He is called Æthelred's
aðum
, meaning either son-in-law or brother-in-law.
[16]
Ann Williams, however, argues that the latter meaning is the appropriate one and refers to Æthelstan as being Ælfgifu's brother.
[8]
possibly unnamed daughter, who became abbess of Wherwell.
[17]
Life and death
[
edit
]
Unlike her mother-in-law,
Ælfthryth
, Ælfgifu was not anointed queen and never signed charters.
[18]
She did have a few mentions in those few contemporary records that survive. In a will issued between 975 and 987, the
thegn
Beorhtric and his wife bequeathed to their
hlæfdige
(lady) an armlet worth 30 gold mancuses and a stallion, to guarantee the will be carried out.
[19]
Another's will of between 990 and 1001 addresses her as “my lady” (
mire hlæfdian
), where Æthelgifu is promised a bequest of 30 mancuses of gold.
[20]
Just as little is known of her life, so the precise date and circumstances of her death cannot be recovered.
[21]
In any event, she appears to have died by 1002, possibly in childbirth, when Æthelred took to wife
Emma of Normandy
, daughter of Count Richard of Rouen, who received or adopted her predecessor's Anglo-Saxon name, Ælfgifu.

Background
[
edit
]
The event was held at the
TD Garden
in
Boston, Massachusetts
.
Hell in a Cell
was a
professional wrestling
event
produced annually in October by
WWE
since 2009. The
concept
of the show came from WWE's established
Hell in a Cell
match, in which competitors fought inside a 20-foot-high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. The main event match of the card was contested under the Hell in a Cell stipulation.
[2]
[3]
[4]
Announced on August 22, 2016, the 2016 event was the eighth Hell in a Cell and was held on October 30 at the

[19]
Preliminary matches
[
edit
]
The actual pay-per-view opened with Roman Reigns defending the United States Championship against Rusev (accompanied by Lana) in a Hell in a Cell match. During the match, Reigns executed a Superman Punch for a near-fall. Reigns attempted a Spear, but Rusev countered with a Jumping Sidekick and pushed Reigns into the steel steps, which were positioned on the top rope, for a near-fall. Rusev applied The Accolade on Reigns, but Reigns escaped. Rusev re-applied The Accolade on Reigns, who was draped over the steel steps, using a steel chain, but Reigns countered with a Samoan Drop onto the steel steps. Reigns executed a Spear off the steel steps on Rusev to retain the title.
[20]
Next, Bayley fought Dana Brooke. In the end, Bayley performed a Bayley-to-Belly Suplex on Brooke to win the match.
[20]
After that, Enzo Amore and Big Cass wrestled Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Gallows and Anderson executed the Magic Killer on Enzo to win the match.
[20]
In the fourth match, Kevin Owens defended the WWE Universal Championship against Seth Rollins in a Hell in a Cell match. During the match, Owens accidentally sprayed the referee with a fire extinguisher, resulting in a second referee entering the cell to check on the downed referee. Chris Jericho ran into the cell and locked the cell door. Rollins attempted a Pedigree on Owens, but Jericho prevented the attempt, leading to Rollins performing a Pedigree on Jericho. Rollins performed a powerbomb on Owens through two tables stacked outside the ring, which was followed by a frog splash, but Jericho pulled the referee out of the ring to void the pinfall at a two count. Rollins attacked Jericho with a powerbomb into the cell wall. Owens performed a superkick and a pop-up powerbomb on Rollins for a near-fall. Rollins attacked both Owens and Jericho with a chair, but Owens executed a DDT on Rollins onto a chair. Owens performed a powerbomb through two chairs on Rollins to retain the title. After the match, Jericho attacked Rollins with a Codebreaker.
[20]
Next, T. J. Perkins defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against The Brian Kendrick. The match ended when Kendrick feigned a knee injury. A concerned Perkins checked on Kendrick, who attacked Perkins with a headbutt and applied the Captain's Hook. Perkins submitted, thus Kendrick won the title.
[20]
After that, The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods, accompanied by Kofi Kingston) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Cesaro and Sheamus. In the end, Cesaro applied the Sharpshooter on Woods. Meanwhile, Sheamus attacked Big E with The New Day's trombone, followed by Kingston executing Trouble in Paradise on Sheamus. As Kingston was not a contestant in the match, the referee disqualified The New Day for outside interference. At the same time, Woods submitted to Cesaro's Sharpshooter. However, as the referee had already issued a disqualification, Cesaro and Sheamus won the match, but The New Day retained the titles.
[20]
Main event
[
edit
]
Charlotte
and
Sasha Banks
made history as the first two women to compete inside
Hell in a Cell
as well as the first two women to wrestle in the
main event
of a
WWE
pay-per-view
. Charlotte defeated Banks to regain the
Raw Women's Championship
for a third time.
In the main event, Sasha Banks defended the Raw Women's Championship against Charlotte in the first-ever women's Hell in a Cell match, which was also the first-ever women's match to main event a WWE PPV. Before the cell lowered, Charlotte attacked Banks, leading to the two fighting outside the cell and into the crowd. Charlotte climbed the cell wall, but was knocked down by Banks. As Banks attempted to climb down, Charlotte caught Banks and powerbombed her through an announce table. Banks was about to be taken away on a stretcher and Charlotte to be declared the winner by forfeit, but Banks got off the stretcher and entered the cell, thus the match officially started. Banks dominated Charlotte early on, but the momentum shifted when Charlotte catapulted Banks into the cell wall for a nearfall. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Charlotte, but Charlotte got to her feet and tossed Banks over the top rope and out of the ring. Charlotte introduced a steel chair, but Banks performed a suicide dive on Charlotte. Later, Charlotte slammed Banks back first onto the chair for a nearfall. Outside the ring, Banks performed a Meteora on Charlotte from the cell wall. Banks then paid tribute to
Eddie Guerrero
by executing the Three Amigos and a Frog Splash on Charlotte for a nearfall. Banks re-applied the Bank Statement on Charlotte, but Charlotte escaped by rolling out of the ring. Banks performed her double knees on Charlotte through the chair for another nearfall. Charlotte then slammed Banks head first on the steel ring steps. Afterwards, Charlotte retrieved a table and attempted a Superplex on Banks through it, but Banks countered, knocking Charlotte onto the table. Banks retrieved another table, but Charlotte used it to ram Banks into the cell wall. Charlotte applied the Figure Four Leglock, but as she bridged into the Figure Eight, Banks attacked Charlotte with a chair to break the submission. After the two traded blows, Charlotte countered another Bank Statement attempt and performed three backbreakers on Banks for a nearfall. In the closing moments, Charlotte attempted a Moonsault on Banks through the table, but Banks cut her off. Banks then positioned the table on the opposite side of the ring and attempted a Powerbomb on Charlotte through it, but her back gave out. Charlotte took advantage by throwing Banks onto the table two times, and then executed Natural Selection to win the title for a third time.

praised the Raw Women's Championship match, giving it a grade of A++, the highest rated match of the event, stating that Sasha Banks and Charlotte's showdown "was everything it needed to be and more", they "proved that they and their peers belong in that sadistic contest", and "made it clear that WWE made the right move in making them the pay-per-view's main event". He also said that the match was "savage, dramatic and breathtaking", Banks and Charlotte "exceeded" the "impossibly high" expectations for the match, the bout was bolstered by "world-class heel work from Charlotte" and "the amount of pathos Banks generated by fighting from underneath, refusing to quit, even when her back threatened to", and concluded by saying that "Banks and Charlotte made it clear that women are more than welcome inside Hell in a Cell and that the women's revolution isn't just a tagline. It's the reality unfolding before our eyes". Dilbert gave the Universal Championship match a grade of A, stating that superstars can still "produce great Hell in a Cell matches in the PG era", the match "was a wild ride with an intriguing story", while saying that "chairs, tables and the cage door all played vital roles". He also mentioned that "Rollins and Owens helped erase memories of an uneven, underwhelming feud here", and concluded by stating that "WWE Creative has to keep up the momentum, figuring out better ways to tell each man's story going forward". Dilbert gave the United States Championship and the Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson vs. Enzo Amore and Big Cass matches C+ grades, the Bayley vs. Dana Brooke match a C- grade (the lowest rated match of the event), the Kickoff pre-show match a B- grade, the Cruiserweight Championship match a B grade, and the Raw Tag Team Championship match a B+ grade.
[21]
Wade Keller
of
Pro Wrestling Torch
gave the United States Championship match 3.25 stars, stating that it was "methodical, but brutal, and well paced for its place on the card", and that Roman Reigns' "over reliance on punches and clotheslines continues to be a drawback in any of his matches". Keller gave the Universal Championship match 4.25 stars, the highest rated match of the event. He called the match "impressive" and that he "liked the pace and the chances taken and the big moves executed", while stating that Seth Rollins and Kevin Owens "sold big moves and didn't just get up as if nothing happened to do another big spot". He also stated that once Chris Jericho joined the fray, "it seemed to mean Owens would win, but there had to be some viewers thinking Jericho might turn on Owens or there'd be a misunderstanding or miscue between them leading to Seth getting a win". Keller gave the main event match 3.75 stars, stating that "the crowd reacted to the finish like they weren't expecting that to be it", but he congratulated Sasha Banks and Charlotte "for putting on a very good Hell in a Cell match without going as overboard as I expected with bit spots from high places on the Cell". He said that "the teaser at the beginning was well done and probably had some skeptics believing that Sasha was too hurt to continue", and concluded by stating that "Charlotte winning with her finisher helps get her finisher over which was worth it compared to doing some sort of big spot, even though I think the fans expected some sort of bigger spot". Keller gave the Bayley vs. Dana Brooke match 1 star, the lowest rated match of the event, the Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson vs. Enzo Amore and Big Cass match 1.75 stars, the Cruiserweight Championship match 2.5 stars, and the Raw Tag Team Championship match 2 stars.
[20]
Dave Meltzer
of the
Wrestling Observer Newsletter
gave the United States, Universal, and Raw Women's championship matches 3.25 stars, 4 stars (the highest rated match of the event), and 2.75 stars, respectively. The Kickoff pre-show match received 3.5 stars, the Bayley vs. Dana Brooke match received 1.5 stars (the lowest rated match of the event), the Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson vs. Enzo Amore and Big Cass match received 2 stars, the Cruiserweight Championship match received 1.75 stars, and the Raw Tag Team Championship match received 2.75 stars.

Aftermath
[
edit
]
While the 2016 Hell in a Cell event was held exclusively for Raw, the
2017 event
was in turn held exclusively for
SmackDown
.
[23]
Heading into Survivor Series
[
edit
]
Earlier in October before Hell in a Cell,
SmackDown
's Commissioner
Shane McMahon
and General Manager
Daniel Bryan
challenged Raw to three traditional
Survivor Series elimination matches
- involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively,
[24]
[25]
to which Stephanie McMahon accepted.
[26]
[27]
After Hell in a Cell, focus then shifted on determining which wrestlers would represent Team Raw for the three teams at
Survivor Series
the following month.
SmackDown's
Intercontinental Champion
Dolph Ziggler
made an open challenge to any wrestler on Raw to face him for the title at Survivor Series. On the November 7 episode of
Raw
, Sami Zayn revealed that Mick Foley wanted him to face Ziggler for the Intercontinental title, and then defeated Rusev, solidifying his spot in the title match at Survivor Series.
[28]
Also, Raw and SmackDown's General Managers came to a negotiation where Foley agreed that since SmackDown was defending the Intercontinental title against a Raw wrestler, he would allow a SmackDown wrestler to challenge new Cruiserweight Champion Brian Kendrick for that title, and if the SmackDown wrestler were to win, the entire cruiserweight division would move to SmackDown.
[29]
Continuing rivalries
[
edit
]
After Survivor Series, Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins would continue their rivalry over the WWE Universal Championship. On the November 21 episode of
Raw
, they battled for the title in a
No Disqualification match
, with Roman Reigns and Chris Jericho banned from ringside. Owens retained after Jericho, who was disguised as a masked fan, interfered and attacked Rollins.
[30]
A match between Rollins and Jericho would later be scheduled for
Roadblock: End of the Line
,
[31]
while Owens was also scheduled to defend his title against Reigns at the event.
[32]
Cesaro and Sheamus would another match against The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) for the Raw Tag Team Championship by being the sole survivors for Team Raw in the tag team elimination match at Survivor Series.
[33]
On the following
Raw
, however, The New Day (Kingston and Big E) retained.
[30]
On the December 5 episode, Cesaro and Sheamus took on Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson to determine the number one contenders, but the match ended in a no-contest after interference from The New Day. This turned the title match on the December 12 episode into a
triple threat tag team match
,
[31]
where The New Day again retained.
[34]
At
WWE Tribute to the Troops
, Cesaro and Sheamus earned another title match at Roadblock: End of the Line by winning a
fatal four-way tag team match
.
[35]
Sasha Banks and Charlotte Flair would continue their rivalry over the Raw Women's Championship as well. On the November 28 episode of
Raw
, after invoking her rematch clause a week prior,
[30]
Banks defeated Charlotte in a
Falls Count Anywhere match
in the latter's hometown of
Charlotte, North Carolina
to win the title for a third time, and was endorsed by Charlotte's father,
Ric Flair
, after the match.
[32]
The following week, Banks challenged Charlotte to an
Iron Woman match
for the title at Roadblock: End of the Line, and Charlotte accepted.

St. Ann's Academy
was built by the
Roman Catholic
Congregation of Women the
Sisters of Saint Anne
of
Lachine, Quebec
. The chapel, designed by Father Joseph Michaud, was built in 1858 as St. Andrew's Cathedral was moved in 1886 to be St. Ann's Chapel and is the oldest part of the Academy.
[1]
Later a convent was added (1887) to the west side of the Academy and behind the Academy (1910). St. Ann’s Academy was a girls
Catholic
boarding and day school from grade 3-12, and boys K - 3, as well as serving as the Provincial House, convent and novitiate.
[2]
[3]
History
[
edit
]
The Sisters of St. Ann closed the Academy and in 1973 sold the property to the provincial government of British Columbia  which used it as office space for the public service for a few years, but it was in need of major repairs and had to be closed. Years-long civic debate of diverse proposals for the future of the building and site ensued.
Placed under the stewardship of the
Provincial Capital Commission
, the interior of the building was gutted and rebuilt, basement to attic, providing seismic upgrade and rehabilitation into modern office space. Once completed, the majority of the building was leased to the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, a use consistent with the Sisters' aims. The exterior facade of his heritage building was retained and repaired. The chapel, parlours and infirmary were retained as an interpretive centre and restored to their 1920s decor. The auditorium at the other end of the building was also seismically upgraded and restored and is used for public lectures and concerts. The building was re-opened in 1997.
The chapel was deconsecrated when the Sisters sold the property. Since the restoration of the chapel and the adjacent Novitiate Garden, these have been used as a venue for weddings and other functions.
An annex behind the main building which had been occupied by the
Victoria Conservatory of Music
was demolished on September 11, 2001 following the Conservatory's move to the former Metropolitan United Church buildings. The site was cleared and became green space, merging the Academy grounds with the adjacent
Beacon Hill Park
.

The Sisters of Saint Ann had two cemeteries at the Academy, where many of the first sisters were buried. In 1908, a plot in the northeast corner of
Ross Bay Cemetery
was opened for future burials. Upon the closure of the Academy in 1974, the first Sisters were exhumed and reinterred in the Sisters' plot in Ross Bay.

Many of the stained glass windows were vandalized during its time of abandonment, and had to be rebuilt during the reconstruction.

History
[
edit
]
New Belgium Brewing company was founded in 1991 by Kim Jordan and Jeff Lebesch.
[4]
The Fat Tire recipe originates from a co-founder's bicycle trip through
Belgium
from brewery to brewery. The company promotes its Fat Tire ale locally by the public placement of colorful vintage bicycles outside its brewery, which is located adjacent to the public bike path along the
Cache La Poudre River
.

In 1999, New Belgium became the first U.S. wind-powered brewery.
Before 2002, New Belgium distributed in only 16 states; by 2015, it had become the fourth-largest craft brewer in the country and the eighth-overall largest brewer in the United States.
[5]
Lebesch left the company in 2009.
[6]
As of August 2017, New Belgium was available in all 50 states.
[7]
As of February 2018, New Belgium was distributed in
Canada
, Australia, Japan,
South Korea
,
Sweden
and
Norway
.

In 2019, New Belgium was acquired by
Lion
, an Australian
subsidiary
of
Kirin
beverage group of Japan.
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
In early 2023, New Belgium Brewing acquired a production brewery in
Daleville, Virginia
from
Constellation Brands
, where New Belgium will focus on brewing Voodoo Rangers
Juice Force IPA
and the
Fruit Force IPA.
[12]
On June 13, 2023, New Belgium Brewing CEO, Steve Fechheimer, stepped down after six years.
[13]
CFO Danielle McLarnon was named interim CEO while they look for a new CEO for the company.
[13]
[14]
In September 2023, New Belgium integrated an industrial heat pump which is projected to reduce its
greenhouse gases
as well as its overall
carbon footprint
.
[15]
[16]
Business and production
[
edit
]
New Belgium's main brewery is in Fort Collins. In 2013, New Belgium had some 480 employees and more than $180 million in sales.
[17]
It has had an
employee stock ownership plan
since 2000 and in January 2013 became 100 percent
employee-owned
[17]
through an
ESOP
.
[18]
[
promotional source?
]
The 2014 documentary
We The Owners
examined New Belgium's focus on employee-ownership and how that shapes its overall
culture
of collaboration.
[19]
2016 saw new additions to the brand, debuts of Voodoo Ranger and Day Blazer line.
[

]
New Belgium is known for its quirky
corporate culture
; the company employs eight "
carnies
," who work the brewery's Tour de Fat fundraising events, in addition to
chemists
,
microbiologists
, electricians,
forklift
operators, and engineers.
[17]
The company has low (3 percent) annual employee turnover, and a tenth of the brewery's employees may take extended leave in any given year.
[17]
Employees who become part-owners of the business are recognized at an annual Ownership Induction Ceremony and are presented with a
cruiser bicycle
recalling the company's symbol.
[17]
The company was named one of the "25 Most Audacious Companies" by
Inc.
magazine.
[17]
Esquire
selected Fat Tire Amber Ale as one of the "Best Canned Beers to Drink Now" in a February 2012 article.
[20]
In May 2014, New Belgium began work on a second brewery in
Asheville, North Carolina
, which became fully operational in May 2016.
[21]
The brewery is positioned along the
French Broad River
on Craven Street in Asheville's River Arts District.
[22]
New Belgium's brewery, which is 133,000 sq ft (12,400 m
2
), has capacity to produce up to a half-million barrels of beer.
[21]
Label design
[
edit
]
Most of New Belgium's beer labels were initially designed by Anne Fitch, a watercolorist whose work appeared on all New Belgium beers for 19 years.
[23]
In 2006, NBB changed its logo because it realised that beer drinkers could identify the Fat Tire label, but "didn't recognize the brewery label, or make the connection that New Belgium brewed Fat Tire and other best-selling brands, such as Sunshine Wheat."
[23]
The company's new logo "pays homage to the well-known Fat Tire brand bicycle" drawn by Anne Fitch.
[23]
Kim Jordan, the president of New Belgium Brewery, credits the success of New Belgium Brewery in part on Fitch's artwork: "Our beers were good, our labels were interesting to people, and we pretty quickly had a fairly robust following."
[24]
In 2010, however, New Belgium unveiled its four-beer Explore Series, whose labels featured a different design.

Christophe Coppens
(born 21 November 1969) is a Belgian artist and opera director, living and working in Belgium.  Trained initially as a theatre director, Coppens started his own label as an
accessories
designer at the age of 21, a career that would span over 20 years with several outlets, international press following and buyers the world over, and that he would combine and nurture with his first stunts and solo shows as an artist.
History
[
edit

Deer Cape & hat, from Coppens's haute couture collection 'Dream Your Dream', Winter 2005
Christophe Coppens initially studied drama at the Brussels Conservatoire/Conservatorium , and whilst pursuing a path as actor and director - quite by chance and following  an invitation to Paris from a renowned fashion magazine - developed a global career on the edge of fashion, design and art.  During the 20 years which followed, he made many collections of fashion accessories, had collaborations in the music, fashion and design world, all whilst developing his work as an artist.
Coppens created his first experimental hat collection in 1990 which was picked up from the start by international buyers and press. Through the years his activities extended to complete accessories collections for men and women and opening outlets in Antwerp, Bruges and Brussels. He would also present his collections twice a year during Paris and Japan
Fashion Week
. Alongside he worked on collaborations for the fashion shows of international renowned designers making hats for the likes of
Issey Miyake
,
[1]
Guy Laroche
, JuunJ and
Manish Arora
, and he created one of a kind presentations for high-end world class retailers Charivay (New York City), Frank et Fils (Paris) and
Joyce Boutique
(Hong Kong and Paris), among others. In Japan he found distribution and representation in fashion group HP France.
In addition Coppens has made accessories for pop stars such as
Rihanna
,
Grace Jones
,
Scissor Sisters
and
Beth Ditto
, and he has worked most closely with
Róisín Murphy
,
[2]
particularly on all the costumes worn by the performer during her 2008/09 Overpowered world tour. Coppens presented his first couture accessories collection in 2006 during Paris
haute couture
Fashion Week, displaying spectacular theatrical skills and the surreal undertone that has become his signature style since the early beginnings. That same year HP France opened his first shop in Tokyo, and he presented his couture collection during Japan Fashion Week.
In 2010 he was named
Royal Warrant Holder in Belgium
, recognition that came after more than 15 years making accessories for the
Belgian Royal Family
. At the end of 2011, to celebrate his 20th anniversary as a
milliner
and artist, Coppens opened an exhibition to show and auction some of his most outstanding couture pieces and artworks, hosted by
Pierre Bergé
& Associates in Brussels.
[3]
In early 2012, following this event, he launched a retrospective book
Homework
encompassing these pieces and other highlights of his career.
[4]
The book was listed among
The New York Times
'
"Summer's 2012 must-reads".
2012 would also mark a very important episode in his career, when, after 21 years of making work on the edge of art and fashion Coppens decided to close his company to focus exclusively on his work as an artist. At this point his label was sold in 140 shops worldwide, his name was heard among fashion connoisseurs and he had become arguably one of the most celebrated milliners in Japan.
Coppens expressed his view on this transition in the exhibition "Everything Is Local: Landscape 1" at the prestigious
Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen
in Rotterdam.
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
The show is a journey through the first six months following this violent break, how to deal with loss, letting go of the past and looking at the future.
In 2015 Coppens was appointed head of a new Master Program at the
Sandberg Instituut
[
nl
]
, Amsterdam.
[9]
That same year he designed the costumes for
Pascal Dusapin
's
opera
To Be Sung
at
De Munt
, Brussels.
[10]
and also designed 15 new masks for
Róisín Murphy
's world tour. In March 2017 Coppens returned to the theatre and directed his first opera at De Munt/La Monnaie in Brussels,
Janáček
's
Foxie! The Cunning Little Vixen
.
[11]
[12]
In 2018 he directed Bartok's Bluebeard's Castle and The Miraculous Mandarin at De Munt/La Monnaie, Norma in 2021. 
At Noord Nederlands Toneel CC directed Dorian, a new play written by Javier Barcala based on the Oscar Wilde novel "The Picture Of Dorian Gray".
From 2013 till 2017 he lived and worked in Los Angeles. From 2017 till 2019 in Madrid. In October 2019 he moved back to Belgium.

Gaston VI
(1173-1214), called
the Good
, was the
Viscount of Béarn
, Gabardan, and Brulhois from 1173. He was also
Count of Bigorre
[1]
and Viscount of Marsan through his marriage in 1196 to
Petronilla
, the daughter of Countess Stephanie-Beatrice of Bigorre.

Gaston was the son of ruling Viscountess
Mary
and
William I of Béarn
. He was the elder of twins, his younger brother being the later viscount
William Raymond
.
[3]
After their birth, in light of the conflict in Béarn over the succession, Mary fled with them to the monastery of
Santa Cruz de Volvestre
.
[

]
A Bearnese delegation reached the monastery in 1173 seeking one of the boys to be their viscount. Mary gave them Gaston, who was taken back to Béarn to rule.
[
citation needed
]
During his minority, a council of regents from
Aragon
governed on his behalf. The council was led by
Pelegrino de Castellarzuelo
, lord of
Barbastro
. The period of the regency, however, is poorly documented. In 1184 he was given prisoners by his liege
Henry II of England
but later complained because he could not collect the ransom money and he had to pay the prisoners expenses.
[4]
In 1187, when fourteen years old, Gaston was declared of age and paid homage to
Alfonso II of Aragon
at
Huesca
.
Like most of the baronage of southern France,
[
citation needed
]
Gaston did not participate in the
Third Crusade
, because of the grand conflict between the crown of Aragon on the one hand and the
county of Toulouse
on the other. Gaston was firmly in the Aragonese camp.
[
citation needed
]
In 1194, a territorial dispute with the
viscounty of Dax
was resolved with the exchange of
Mixe
and
Ostabarret
,
Ostabat
, in return for the city of
Orthez
from Dax.
[
citation needed
]
In 1196, peace was also made with
Soule
. In that same year, he married Petronilla of Bigorre
[5]
and thus made peace with all his neighbours.
[
citation needed
]
In 1208,
Pope Innocent III
ordered the
Albigensian Crusade
against the
Cathars
in southern France. Innocent ordered Gaston not to intervene against the crusaders, but Gaston took part in the relief of Toulouse from the besieging army of
Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester
in 1211.
[
citation needed
]
He also took part in the disastrous attack on
Castelnaudary
.
[6]
However, neither of these acts were religiously based, as neither Béarn nor Bigorre had many Cathars, but grounded rather in his loyalty to
Peter II of Aragon
, who was forced to come to the protection of his other vassals attacked by the crusaders.
[
citation needed
]
Gaston was attacked by the crusade nevertheless. Gaston lost Brulhois and was excommunicated by the Council of Vabres and his territories declared forfeit by the pope.
[7]
On 15 January 1213, Gaston did homage to Peter II of Aragon along with Bernard IV of Comminges, (circa 1150 - Count 1175 - 22 February 1225),
Raimond-Roger of Foix
, and
Raymond VI of Toulouse
. Peter II thus intended to create a vast transpyrenean empire;
[
citation needed
]
however it was all undone at the
Battle of Muret
on 12 September. There Peter died in a losing cause because he had overconfidently neglected to summon his vassals with enough time for them all to arrive. Gaston was one of those who did not participate. Soon after the battle, however, Innocent III publicly pardoned the lords of Béarn and Comminges.
[
citation needed
]
The only penance imposed upon Gaston was to give to the bishop two of the districts of the city of
Oloron
.
[
citation needed
]
In return, he also received back Brulhois.
His loyalty to the king of Aragon, however, remained clearly expressed in the
Llibre dels fets
(chapt. 37). There he appears along with his brother at the side of the young king
James I
at the siege of
Tamarite de Litera
.
[

]
Gaston died without issue in 1214 and was succeeded by his brother William Raymond.
[8]
His widow retained Bigorre.

In
human anatomy
, the
inframammary fold
(IMF),
inframammary crease
or
inframammary line
is the natural lower boundary of the
breast
, the place where the breast and the
chest
meet. The choice of the term depends on the prominence of the feature. It is also sometimes called the
inframammary ligament
. From the
cosmetological
point of view, it is an important aesthetic component of the breast which should be taken into consideration during various kinds of
breast surgery
.
[1]
[2]
Histologically
, the inframammary fold is an intrinsic dermal structure consisting of regular arrays of
collagen
held in place by a specialized
superficial fascia
system.
[3]
The fold is formed by the fusion of the superficial and mammary
fasciae
.

from 1943 to 1968.
[5]
Early life
[
edit
]
Trikojus was born on 5 February 1902 in
Darlinghurst
,
Sydney
, to August Trikojus (1857-1911) and Charlotte (née Thompson, 1879-1955), his second wife.
[6]
[7]
His father was a
hairdresser
and
tobacconist
of
Lithuanian
background
[8]
born in Tilsit,
East Prussia
(now
Sovetsk
,
Kaliningrad Oblast
,
Russia
). His mother was of English background, born in
Port Macquarie
. He was the eldest of three children.
[9]
Trikojus attended
Sydney Technical High School
from 1916 to 1920 where he studied physics, chemistry, mathematics, history, English, German, woodwork, metalwork, and mechanical drawing. He became head prefect, captain and dux of the school, and a member of its rugby and rowing teams. It was here where he received the nickname "Trik", by which he would be known to his family, friends and colleagues for the rest of his life.
[2]
Trikojus earned a first class
honours degree
in
organic chemistry
from the
University of Sydney
in 1925.
[10]
In that same year, he was awarded an
1851 Exhibition science research scholarship
and chose to study at the
University of Oxford
under
William Henry Perkin Jr
. where he also rowed in the
Queens College
Eight. Trikojus' thesis was entitled 'The Introduction of the Methylenedioxy Group and of Similar Groups into the
Aromatic
Nucleus'; evidence of Perkin's habit of assigning his students small pieces of larger problems. This thesis earned him his
Doctorate of Philosophy
in 1927 making him only the second Australian to do so, after
Henry Brose
. Trikojus and Perkin Jr. also published work on the synthesis of
safrole
.
[11]
Following this, he was awarded a third year of his scholarship, which he spent in
Munich
, working under
Heinrich Wieland
at the Laboratorium des Staates.
Research and Teaching
[
edit
]
After nine months in Munich, Trikojus returned to Sydney late in 1928, due to his mother becoming ill. There he found a position of lecturer in the Department of Organic Chemistry at the University of Sydney. From having a European father and spending time in those countries, Trikojus felt comfortable in the more-vibrant émigré communities in Sydney. There he met his future wife,
Russian émigrée
Lisuscha Engels (born 1905
Fryanovo
,
Russian Empire
, died 1984, Melbourne),
[12]
who had accompanied her wool-buyer father from Germany. In 1932 he took up a lectureship in medical organic chemistry in the Department of Medicine. That was also the year he and Lisuscha married, living in
Kings Cross
. In newspaper articles, his wife's first name was often anglicised to Elizabeth.
[13]
Until 1936, Trikojus' research was centred on discovering the chemical structures of
organic compounds
, and occasionally developing methods to synthesise organic compounds in the laboratory. He had published nine
scientific papers
on this kind of work. 1936 marked a major shift in his interests when the head of his department, Prof.
Charles George Lambie
, published work on
thyroid hormone
metabolism. Trikojus began his
sabbatical
leave that year in Germany, at the
University of Freiburg
, working on thyrotropic hormone (better known as
thyroid-stimulating hormone
) with Arnold Loeser. Thyroid enzymes would remain his passion throughout his scientific career.
[14]
[15]
Lisuscha accompanied him, along with their first child, Nina (born 1934),
[9]
who died suddenly that year in
Stuttgart
of a respiratory infection.
[16]
After returning to Australia in 1937, Trikojus and Lisuscha had another daughter, Natalja.
On 1 November 1937, Trikojus wrote an article entitled ‘Some impressions of Germany and neighbouring countries’
(Australian Institute of International Affairs
), in which stated, "I have been greatly impressed by the regeneration which
Hitler
has wrought in the nation" and "The
anti-Jewish propaganda
continues, but it is not serious... It is interesting to note that any Jews who are useful to the Nazis are kept in their positions". These comments arose from a cloistered scientific environment and were by no means political at the time - knowledge of the persecution that was happening in Germany wasn’t widespread in the general community. However, they assumed far greater significance after the outbreak of war and, together with Trikojus' contact with scientists and friends in Germany and command of the German language, would have disastrous consequence for his life and family. His biographers Legge and Gibson note that "a number of members of Lisuscha's family were still living in Germany, and he may simply have been careful to avoid making any remarks that might conceivably affect them."
[2]
World War II
[
edit
]
In 1940, Trikojus was chair of the Drugs Subcommittee of the Australian Association of Scientific Workers. The Australian
pharmaceutical industry
was insufficiently advanced to produce critical drugs in the event of closure of sea-lanes for imports from Europe and the USA. He organised the up-scaling of drug production for 11 different drugs critical for the war effort including ascorbic acid (
vitamin C
) and
sulfaguanidine
. His previous experience in the development of methods to synthesise organic compounds was invaluable in his efforts. His son, future
cinematographer
Alexander (Sasha) Trikojus was also born that year.
[17]
On 17 January 1941, Trikojus was arrested as an
enemy alien
under National Security Regulations and spent 13 weeks in
Long Bay
gaol, then used as a temporary
internment camp
.
[18]
The case against him was never made clear and Trikojus never spoke publicly about it, however his extensive connections to Germany, the years he lived there and his proficiency in the language may have led some to doubt his loyalties; there were also suggestions that internal rivalries at Sydney University had played a part.
[2]
After a review of his case, and pressure from his colleagues, he was released in April. He immediately resumed his duties lecturing at the university and coordinating methods of producing critical war drugs so they could be handed off to industry. This included organising the manufacture of 45 kg of sulfaguanidine in a laboratory in his university's medical school, for the
New Guinea campaign
in 1942.
[19]
He ceded
patent rights
for his sulfaguanidine manufacturing process to
Monsanto
so full-scale production could be expedited. His process for ascorbic acid synthesis was likewise handed over to Colonial Sugar Refineries (now
CSR limited
).
[2]
Professor of Biochemistry
[
edit
]
By 1943, the drug import routes were judged safe enough for work on domestic production to end, and the Trikojus family moved to Melbourne where he was appointed head of the Biochemistry Department at the
University of Melbourne
. He inherited an under-staffed and under-resourced department and expended much energy in administrative work to bring the department up to the standard of the other major universities.
[2]
His work was further increased when student numbers swelled after the war, supported by the Commonwealth Reconstruction and Training Scheme. A new biochemistry building was needed, with Trikojus overseeing the construction and assisting in its design. The building was opened in stages between 1958 and 1961.
[2]
This building, the first in Australia to be devoted to the study and teaching of biochemistry, housed researchers until 2005, when they were moved to the new
Bio21 institute
. It was demolished in 2008, and in its place the Australian Centre for Neuroscience and Mental Health Research was constructed.
[20]
During his tenure, the University of Melbourne was transformed from an
undergraduate
teaching university to an internationally oriented research university that encouraged collaboration between universities. In 1948 Trikojus and his colleague F. J. R. Hird isolated and identified
triiodothyronine
(T
3
),
[21]
however this discovery is generally attributed to
Rosalind Pitt-Rivers
,
[22]
who read their paper but omitted mention of it.
[10]
Trikojus continued building up the
Russell Grimwade
School of Biochemistry, in which he integrated organic chemistry and biochemistry, as well as links to other disciplines. He was a foundation member (1955), chairman (1956), and honorary life member (1964) of the Australian Biochemical Society and a fellow (1954), and vice-president (1964-66) of the
Australian Academy of Science
. He was a foundation member (1958) and life member (1968) of the Endocrine Society of Australia.
[23]
He was also Melbourne's first professorial dean of graduate studies (1963-65) and a foundation member (1965-66) of the Australian Research Grants Committee. He also supervised graduate students, including the masters research of
Catherine Anne Money
,
[24]
[15]
and was inspirational to countless other medical students and science graduates.
Trikojus was well-liked by his colleagues and students, who found in him a courteous and compassionate authority figure with a legendary capacity for research, teaching, and administrative work. On retirement in 1968, he was made an
honorary
research professor, and was appointed
CBE
in 1971. He remained active in the International Union of Biochemists and as a
visiting scientist
in the early 1970s.
[17]
He continued contributing to scientific journals until 1974.
[14]
Suffering
Parkinson's disease
in his later years, Victor Trikojus died on 27 January 1985 in the Melbourne suburb of
Kew
and was
cremated
. 73 boxes of his papers were donated by his family to The University of Melbourne Archives, where they are held.

"1951-52 Fighting Illini men's basketball team"
The
1951-52 Illinois Fighting Illini men’s basketball team
represented the University of Illinois.
Regular season
[
edit
]
The 1951-52
Fighting Illini men's basketball
team had reached a level of national prominence that was only bettered by the 1914-15 national championship team.  Head coach
Harry Combes
had guided his team to a
Big Ten
championship, a third place finish in the
1952 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament
and a final
AP
ranking of No. 2 in the nation.  Combes was beginning to build a dynasty in
Champaign
with 3 Big Ten Championships and 3 third place finishes in the NCAA tournament in his first 5 years at the helm.  The 1951-52 season not only brought Illinois another Big Ten title, it also introduced John Kerr, a center from Tilden Tech in Chicago. He began his three-year reign as Illinois’ top scorer with a sophomore-record 357 points. The Illini recorded a 22-4 overall mark and went 12-2 in the conference. Once again, Illinois advanced to the national semifinals and ran into underdog
St. John’s
. The Redmen fought their way to a 61-59 victory in the NCAA’s first Final Four, in
Seattle
. Illinois took another third-place award home after beating
Santa Clara
, 67-64, behind 26 points by Kerr.  At the conclusion of the tournament, Kerr and
James Bredar
were named to the Final Four All-Tournament team. Subsequently, at the conclusion of the season,
Rodney Fletcher
was named a
Consensus 1st team All-American
.
The starting lineup for the season included
captain
Rodney Fletcher, James Bredar and Irving Bemoras at guard, Clive Follmer at the forward slot with Robert Peterson and, future hall of famer
Johnny "Red" Kerr
at the center position.  The team also included former University of Minnesota head coach
Jim Dutcher
.

The sketch comedy television show
Saturday Night Live
(
SNL
) has for almost three decades aired a number of sketches parodying
Hillary Clinton
, from her time as
First Lady
, and during both her presidential campaigns in
2008
and
2016
.
[1]
A total of nine different performers have played Hillary Clinton on
SNL
.
[2]
The array of
SNL
cast members portraying Clinton has included
Jan Hooks
,
Janeane Garofalo
,
Vanessa Bayer
,
Ana Gasteyer
,
Amy Poehler
, and
Kate McKinnon
.
[1]
Guest stars playing Clinton have included
Drew Barrymore
and
Rachel Dratch
.
[2]
One sketch featured
Miley Cyrus
in a guest appearance as Clinton, rapping: "What's up y'all? I'm like Hillary Clinton, and I wanna be president one day."
[3]
History
[
edit
]
Jan Hooks
was the first to portray Hillary Clinton, and after Hooks left the show in 1991, she returned later to make several subsequent guest appearances as Hillary, with
Phil Hartman
as Hillary's husband
Bill Clinton
.
[1]
One of the earliest Jan Hooks sketches, which aired in May 1993, features her interpretation of Hillary eager to be a "co-president" with Bill, now the newly elected president. Hooks' Hillary tells her husband about her big plans for his health care bill, and gets into a fistfight with Senator
Bob Dole
(
Dan Aykroyd
).
[4]
Beginning with the 1994 season,
Janeane Garofalo
played Hillary as First Lady, with
Michael McKean
portraying president Clinton.
[1]
Ana Gasteyer
played Hillary during the
Lewinsky scandal
of the late 1990s, as well as during her run for the U.S. Senate in New York, with
Darrell Hammond
playing the role of her husband.
[1]
In one Gasteyer sketch, set in the Clintons'
Chappaqua
kitchen, with Hillary making an attempt to appear more personable for the cameras during her Senate campaign, she says, "I can't wait to prepare some food dishes in this kitchen, such as salads and toast."
[4]
SNL
cast member
Amy Poehler
had the longest-running role as Clinton, playing the role regularly from 2003 to 2008 (and reprising it twice, in 2012 and 2015).
[1]
[5]
During the 2008-09 season, the show aired several critically acclaimed sketches featuring Poehler as Clinton, and
Tina Fey
as
Sarah Palin
.
[6]
[7]
Hillary Clinton first made an appearance on the show and faced off with Poehler as her
doppelgänger
.
[1]
[8]
[9]
Kate McKinnon
has portrayed Clinton regularly since March 2015. Darrell Hammond has stated that he only agreed to reprise his role as
Bill Clinton
because McKinnon was so good in her role, calling her a "virtuoso".
[10]
In the 2014-2015 season,
SNL
began airing another series of Hillary Clinton sketches, on the occasion of Clinton's announcement of her candidacy for the
2016 presidential campaign
, with
Kate McKinnon
now as Clinton.
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
Former
SNL
cast member
Darrell Hammond
returned to reprise his portrayal of Bill Clinton in previous season skits.
[15]
McKinnon again portrayed Clinton on October 17, 2015, for
SNL
'
s rendering of the
Democratic Primary Presidential
debate
which had aired on
CNN
on October 13.
[16]
On October 8, 2016, in episode 2 of season 42, Kate McKinnon played Hillary Clinton after her headquarters obtained news of Donald Trump talking about how he could
grab women
"by the
pussy
", something he
did say in real life
.

Bnei Yehud
(
Hebrew
:
בני יהוד
) is an Israeli
football
club based in
Yehud
. The club is currently in
Liga Gimel
Tel Aviv division.
History
[
edit
]
The club was founded in 2007 as
Bnei Shefi Yehud
, a successor club to
Maccabi Yehud
,
[1]
[2]
which was founded in
1954
and dissolved at the end of the
2006-07 season
.
[3]
A year later, in 2008,
Hapoel Yehud
was re-founded as
Hapoel Ironi Yehud
,
[4]
and both clubs competed at the
2008-09 season
in
Liga Gimel Tel Aviv division
. In 2009, Bnei Shefi Yehud merged with Hapoel Ironi Yehud, and the merged club became known as
Hapoel Bnei Yehud
,
[5]
officially as
Bnei Yehud
.
In the
2011-12 season
, Bnei Yehud finished runners-up in
Liga Gimel Tel Aviv division
and were eventually promoted to
Liga Bet
, after a vacancy was created in Liga Bet South B division, as
F.C. Kiryat Gat
joined a merger with
Maccabi Kiryat Gat
.
[6]
However. the club's spell in Liga Bet lasted only one season, as they finished at the bottom of the South B division in the
2012-13 season
, winning only two games, and relegated back to
Liga Gimel
.

The
2008
MTV Video Music Awards
took place on September 7, 2008, live from
Paramount Pictures
Studios (which, like MTV, is owned by
Viacom
), honoring the best
music videos
from the previous year. Nominations for a majority of the categories were announced on the
MTV
program
FNMTV
after being selected through viewer online voting at MTV.com. The remaining, professional categories were chosen by a panel of music industry professionals and announced via press release on August 27.
[1]
When the nomination process was first announced, it mentioned a previously-unheard professional category named "Best Story;"
[2]
however, this award did not come to fruition when the list of professional nominees was revealed the following month.
Unlike previous editions of the show, MTV announced the winners to the professional categories three days before the ceremony (September 4) via a press release, rather than on the pre-show or main show.
[3]
The rest of the winners were announced during the ceremony. Comedian
Russell Brand
hosted the event.
[4]
This year's awards were a huge improvement ratings-wise, seeing a 19% rise on
last year
with 8.4 million viewers. It was also a 23% advance over the 5.76 million who saw the
2006 ceremony
. Although ratings improved, this year's video music awards was hosted at its smallest venue of its 25-year history.
Britney Spears
became the main winner of the night, walking away with her first three Moonmen: Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Pop Video all for "
Piece of Me
".
The Pussycat Dolls
received the most nominations (6), followed by
Chris Brown
and
Katy Perry
(5).

Controversy
[
edit
]
One of host Brand's jokes during the night centered around
purity rings
, specifically those worn by the
Jonas Brothers
.
Jordin Sparks
, who also wears a purity ring, began her introduction of
T.I.
and
Rihanna
by saying, "It's not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut." Sparks was criticized for implying that those who do not wear purity rings or do not
abstain
are promiscuous.
[9]
Brand later described the experience, and aftermath, during his 2009 comedy special 'Scandalous - Live At The O2'.
Censorship
[
edit
]
In repeat airings all references to
John McCain
and
George W. Bush
were removed from Russell Brand's opening monologue.

Promotion
[
edit
]
Several Promos were made that featured host
Russell Brand
and MTV regulars
Britney Spears
,
Pete Wentz
, and
LL Cool J
. Britney Spears' promos were given a lot of attention. The promos featured Spears and Brand in a Paramount lot ad-libbing while an elephant was positioned in the background, reference to "the
elephant in the room
", rumored to be her criticized 2007 VMA performance, which they refrained from discussing in the commercials.
[10]
[11]
There was also a promotion that appeared on Nickelodeon, featuring the cast of
iCarly
.
During the program, the MTV networks
VH1
,
MTV Hits
, and
MTV Jams
did not air their usual programming at all, instead displaying full-screen cards guiding viewers to watch the ceremony on MTV, with VH1 using a rotating "billboard" of sponsors to promote 'sneak peeks' of the live ceremony which appeared in the top-left corner with false crowd noise in the background. During the VMA commercial breaks, VH1 also carried regular advertising.

Dagestani historian
Muhammad Rafi
(also known as
Diya ad-Din Abul-Fath al-Makki
or
Mullah Rafi
) was a medieval
Dagestani
historian who lived in the second half of the 13th century. The author of the historical chronicle "
Tarikhi Dagestan
" (“
History of Dagestan
”) written in 1312-1313. The chronicle was supplemented and received its final form only in the 17th century.
[1]
[2]
Tarikhi Dagestan
[
edit
]
"Tarikhi Dagestan" includes several texts created at different times.
[3]
The most ancient part of "Tarikh Dagestan" can be considered its beginning - a story about the
pagan
Avar
lands, about the income of
Nutsal
(ruler) and the former greatness of the rulers of Avar lands, known in
Arabic
historical and geographical literature of the 9th-10th centuries under the name
Sarir
.
[4]
"Tarikh Dagistan"
[5]
is also a collection of various historical stories relating to different historical periods, and also contains a number of legendary stories.
[6]
In the structure of the chronicle, four independent directions of narration can be distinguished:
[7]
the fate of
paganism
and the rulers of the
Avar region
(Avaria),
Islamization
of the
Dagestan
population; the struggle of the Dagestanis against the
Mongol invaders
,
[8]
feudalism
in
Dagestan
and the
shamkhal
rulers of the 14th-century.
[1]
The original version of this work was also written much earlier before the birth of this author, presumably in 318-930.
[9]
[10]
Vladimir Minorsky
suggested dating the work to the 13th-century,
[11]
with which the Soviet Caucasian specialist
L. Lavrov
agreed.
[12]
Currently, more than 40 lists of Tarikhi Dagestan are known in copies of the 18th - early 20th centuries. All texts are in
Arabic
and the scribes are Dagestanis by origin.
[13]
It is noteworthy to mention that list No.38 was used by
Abbasgulu Bakikhanov
in "
Golestan-e Eram
".
[14]
However, he himself notes that in the manuscript of 1030
AH
(1620), excerpts from a story written in 712 AH (1312) by Muhammad Rafi and old notes from an essay compiled in 318 AH (930) were used.
[4]
Vladimir Minorsky
also wrote: “This is a collection of local legends about some descendants of the “Uncles of the
Prophet
”, who allegedly emigrated to
Dagestan
from
Syria
.

John Randle
(1 February 1855 - 27 February 1928) was a West African medical doctor who was active in politics in
Lagos
, now in Nigeria, in the colonial era. Born in
Sierra Leone
, he was one of the first West Africans to qualify as a medical doctor in the
United Kingdom
. On return he worked for the
Lagos Colony
colonial medical service for a while, then left due to discrimination and built up a successful private practice, treating both Europeans and Africans. He co-founded the
People's Union
in 1908, a political association that sometimes opposed government measures. During
World War I
(1914-18) he was loyal to the
British Empire
. In post-war politics the conservative People's Union was not a serious competitor to the more radical
Nigerian National Democratic Party
.
Early years
[
edit
]
John Randle
[1]
was born on 1 February 1855. His father, Thomas Randle, was a liberated slave from an Oyo village in the west of what is now Nigeria.
His father later moved to Lagos and set up a successful business as a
haberdasher
.
[2]
Randle's birthplace of
Regent, Sierra Leone
was a settlement of liberated slaves from various parts of West Africa and as far afield as
Mozambique
. He was educated at the missionary school in the village and then at the
Church Mission Society
grammar school in
Freetown
.
He became a "dispenser" at the Colonial Hospital in 1874. He moved to
Accra
, then on the
Gold Coast
, where he saved enough to pay for formal medical training at the
University of Edinburgh
in Scotland between 1884 and 1888, graduating with a gold medal in
materia medica
. Randle and his fellow-student
Obadiah Johnson
obtained positions in 1889 as Assistant Colonial Surgeons in the Lagos Colonial Hospital. At the same time, Randle practiced privately, treating most of the European traders of Lagos, particularly the Germans.
[3]
In November 1890 Randle married
Victoria Matilda Davies
. His wife's father was the wealthy
James Pinson Labulo Davies
and her mother was
Sara Forbes Bonetta
, a Yoruba princess whom
Queen Victoria
had arranged to have adopted and educated at the queen's expense. Queen Victoria had given Matilda Davies the name Victoria at her christening, had bestowed an allowance of £40 for life and had given her a solid gold christening set.
[4]
[a]
The queen donated the material for Matilda's wedding gown.
[4]
Dr Sodeinde Akinsiku Leigh-Sodipe (1865-1901) was godfather at the 1893 christening of Randle's son Romanes Adewale.
[5]
Randle resigned from the Colonial Service in 1892. He was angry that as an African he was given about half the salary of a European with the same training, and that he was being required to serve as a doctor in locations far from Lagos.
Gilbert Thomas Carter
, Governor of Lagos in 1891-97, said of his resignation, "My past experience of native doctors ... does not encourage me to place much faith in their aptitude for this profession..." Randle withdrew his resignation, but asked for an increase in salary to £500 per year.
[3]
Randle was dismissed from the service in September 1893 for his persistent refusal to make tours of duty to the British military outpost at
Ijebu Ode
.
[2]
He devoted himself to private medical practice, in which he was highly successful.
He served patients from all levels of society, providing free treatment to the poor.
[6]
Randle was successful in treating
yellow fever
and
guinea worm
infestation.
[4]
Pre-war politics
[
edit
]
Randle acquired large landholdings in Lagos and a significant shareholding in the
Bank of British West Africa
.
[6]
He became active in the politics of the Lagos Colony.
[6]
In 1890 Randle was a member of a committee that invited the
pan-Africanist
educator, journalist and politician
Edward Wilmot Blyden
to Lagos to support them in their dispute over the Niger Mission, where most African ministers had recently been suspended on openly racist grounds.
[7]
On 2 January 1891, at a meeting attended by Governor
Cornelius Alfred Moloney
, Blyden proposed an independent African Church with Bishop
Samuel Ajayi Crowther
as its head.
[8]
Randle may have supported the journalist
John Payne Jackson
when he founded the
Lagos Weekly Record
in 1891.
[9]
In 1899 Governor Sir
William MacGregor
made Randle a "provisional member" of the Legislative Council.
[4]
In 1908 Randle and Dr.
Orisadipe Obasa
founded the People's Union, open to Lagos residents of all religious and ethnic backgrounds.
[10]
The People's Union was a political association rather than a political party.
[11]
Key members of the People's Union other than Randle and Obasa included conservatives such as Sir
Kitoye Ajasa
, Dr
Richard Akinwande Savage
and Sir
Adeyemo Alakija
.
[12]
The Union fought the Water Rate Act, which they said would bring piped water only to Europeans.
In 1911 People's Union members toured
Yorubaland
to agitate against the proposal by Governor
Frederick Lugard
to declare all land to be the property of the government.
[10]
Randle and Obasa may have gone to London to press their case.
[13]
The government dropped the proposal.
[14]
Before
World War I
(1914-18) Randle was approached by Richard Akinwande Savage and
Casely Hayford
about holding a West African conference. He was enthusiastic about the idea, and was elected chairman of the Lagos committee for the conference in 1915. Nothing could be done during the war.
[15]
World War I
[
edit
]
When the war began, Randle became superintendent of the Nigerian Overseas Comfort Fund, which tried to ensure that Nigerians serving abroad were recognized and that their material needs were supplied. In 1915 Lugard again tried to introduce the Water Rate in Lagos, and accused the People's Union of sedition and of "threats of agitation."
[14]
The Chief Imam (
Lemomu
) of Lagos supported the water rate, as did Alli Balogun, a wealthy Muslim who was associated with Randle.
[16]
The People's Union backed down and asked only for a "not exorbitant rate." As a result of this capitulation the People's Union lost support from the Lagos elite.
[14]
Like other West Africans, Randle supported the war, although some did not.
[14]
He wrote of them,
in recent years the administration of the government ... has not given the people entire satisfaction. The people see the government as not carried on in their interest. But, however painfully true this is, let us not forget the wider principle that we are citizens of the British Empire."
[14]
Post-war
[
edit
]
After the war Randle and
Orisadipe Obasa
founded the Reform Club, which took an interest in politics and education.
[15]
This seems to have been a continuation of the People's Union under another name.
[17]
In 1920 Randle was appointed one of the vice-patrons of the Sierra Leonean Friendly Society of Lagos. He built a chapel and two schools in his home town of Regent, and contributed funds to erect a science building at
Fourah Bay College
, Sierra Leone and to support science teaching there.
[15]
The Pan-African conference was held in Accra in 1920 and launched the
National Council of British West Africa
(NCBWA). 
By this time Randle and Savage had fallen out and Randle did not attend the conference.
[15]
Herbert Macaulay
founded the
Nigerian National Democratic Party
(NNDP) in 1922 with the support of leading nationalists such as John Payne Jackson.
[18]
Governor Sir
Hugh Clifford
instituted elections in Lagos in 1923.
[15]
The People's Union was revived under Randle's leadership, and Obasa competed in the election but was not successful. 
The People's Union and its female equivalent, the Women's Union led by Mrs. O. Obasa, opposed the NNDP.
Although the People's Union favored gradual introduction of reforms while the NNDP was radical, both drew their membership from the Lagos elite.
[19]
Some professional men with progressive ideas became members of the People's Union, such as the journalist
Ernest Ikoli
, who was its last secretary, but the People's Union was never a real challenge to the NNDP.
[12]
In 1927 the People's Union, by now quickly losing members, did manage to block a government proposal for a poll tax and have it replaced by an income tax.
[15]
John Randle died on 27 February 1928 and was buried in the rear of the Ikoyi cemetery in Lagos.
[20]
The People's Union dissolved soon after.
[12]
In 1940 Randle's remains were moved to the front of the cemetery as a gesture to acknowledge his achievements.
[20]
Randle was known for his personal austerity and discipline. 
Even at the age of seventy he always rode a bicycle.
He passionately encouraged many Africans to pursue extensive learning, yet he was accused by some of his own children of neglecting their basic education.
[2]
He believed in African culture but had the tastes of a Victorian English gentleman, even ordering food from London.
He was always true to his principles, and his generous will established his reputation as a philanthropist.
[2]
He donated his medical and scientific books and journals to Fourah Bay College, and donated money for a professorship and medical scholarships.

was met with generally favorable reviews from critics. At
Metacritic
, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an
average
score of 61, based on eight reviews.
[1]
Mojo
reviewer wrote that Rev Run's "bellowed cadences are as timeless and elemental as the blues".
[1]
AllMusic
's David Jeffries wrote: "The skimpy run time is noticeable and downright perplexing coming from an album that ambitiously delivers otherwise".
[2]
Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews.com wrote: "I cautiously recommend
Distortion
to
Run-D.M.C.
fans as being a lot better than their unceremonious disaster of a final album
Crown Royal
while openly admitting anybody younger than 18 may not relate to it and pass right on by to something else".
[5]
Q
reviewer stated: "yet for all the nostalgia, the lurching strut of tracks such as "Boom Ditty" and "Breaktime" remains undeniably potent and contemporary".
[1]
In mixed reviews,
Blender
critic wrote: "despite the occasional misstep... it's a welcome album to anyone who wishes the past 15 years never happened to Run-D.M.C.'s legacy".
[1]
Sean Fennessey of
Pitchfork
summarized with: "this album is almost a non-entity".
[4]
Rolling Stone
reviewer wrote: "a CD of biblical rap would have been vastly more interesting than just tepid updates of the Run-DMC sound".
[1]
In a negative review,
Entertainment Weekly
writer described the album as "an awkward attempt that neither improves upon nor updates the trio's original blueprint".

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Florence Ethel Mills Young
(1875 - 6 November 1945
[1]
) was an English writer of popular fiction.
Work
[
edit
]
Born in
Twickenham, Middlesex
, United Kingdom, in 1875,
[1]
Young wrote 50 novels between 1910 and 1941.
[2]
Her early works were often about the English in southern Africa.
Her novel,
Myles Calthrope I. D. B.
, was filmed as
Thou Art the Man
in 1920.
A Mistaken Marriage
(1908) contains highly negative Jewish characters, as do many novels about South Africa in that period, in connection with illegal diamond selling. The main character is said by the heroine to have "the ugliest smile she had ever seen distort a human face."
[3]
Noting the publication of
The Purple Mists
,
The Spectator
comments in 1914 that it features "a strong, silent man", and adds: "Miss Young writes with remarkable fluency and has a strong grip of the plot."
[4]
At least one of her novels was translated into German.
[5]
She died in
Three Anchor Bay
,
Cape Town
,
South Africa
at 6 November 1945.

Walton
is a village and
civil parish
in the
City of Wakefield
in the county of
West Yorkshire
, England, 3.5 miles south-east of
Wakefield
. At the time of the 2011 Census, the parish had a population of 3,231.
[1]
At the time of the 2011 Census the parish was part of the City of Wakefield's ward of Crofton, Ryhill and Walton. The population of this ward at the Census was 15,144.
[2]
Historically
part of the
West Riding of Yorkshire
, the village lies on the
Barnsley Canal
and is home to
Walton Hall
, once the residence of
Charles Waterton
, known as 'Squire' Waterton. He was a
naturalist
and
explorer
who, in 1820, transformed the grounds of the Walton Hall estate the world's first
nature reserve
. The estate is also often referred to on Ordnance Survey maps, etc., as Walton Park and, less frequently, as Walton Hall Park.  More recently, it has become widely known as Waterton Park.
Walton Hall is now Waterton Park Hotel. The park is now largely given over to a golf course, also named Waterton Park. There are public rights of way crossing the park.
Nearby, the site of the now demolished Walton Colliery, formerly known as Sharlston West
colliery
, has been transformed into a nature park (Walton Colliery Nature Park). Large lakes were constructed when the reserve was
landscaped
in the mid-1990s and the excavated earth was then used to cover the colliery's vast
spoil heaps
. The village also contains a small park, a
tennis club
,
football
and
rugby
pitches
, a newly renovated
pub
and a sports and social club.
[3]
[4]
Name
[
edit
]
The village was recorded in the
Domesday Book
(
c.
1086
) as
Waleton
, but from
c.
650 - 830
, it was known as
Weala-tun
, a name which means '
Welshman's
Village'. This suggests a settlement of native British people was established well before the
Saxons
arrived during the 7th century. During the
Norman dynasty
, the village was recorded as
Waton
, but since the Middle Ages (
c.
1154
) to the present day, the village has held its current name of
Walton
.
[5]
Schools
[
edit
]
The first village school was established in the village in 1722 when two large
cottages
on Shay Lane were donated by Charles Waterton (grandfather of the aforementioned Squire Charles Waterton). One of the two cottages was a small
schoolroom
and the other was
let
to the newly appointed
schoolmaster
free of charge, providing the two poor children of the village were educated for free.
In 1790, money from the
will
of wealthy woman called Catherine Neville of Chevet, Wakefield was donated. These funds were used to establish a new, free school in Walton which operated alongside a few other smaller schools in the area.
In 1857 Miss. Mary Pilkington of Chevet Hall,
Sandal
, financed the construction of a new school, a schoolmasters house and a
laundry school
on School Lane. This school continued its existence until 1911, gradually taking on more pupils from the other village schools until they were deemed redundant and closed.
It was closed and demolished in 1911, but replaced shortly after by another new school building for children aged 3 to 11.
As the village population grew, the new school was soon over capacity and a solution was needed. To combat this problem, a new infant school was built on The Grove, taking on all the pupils aged 3 to 8, with the pupils aged 8 to 11 remaining at the original building.
The original school closed in 2007 and the infant school was demolished when a new replacement was constructed in its place. It caters to the pupils of both the old infant school and the original school, as well as containing the new village library. The original 1911 school was finally demolished in 2009.
[6]
In 2019, eight dwellings were erected on the site.
Churches
[
edit
]
Since the 19th century, there have been two
places of worship
for the village community.
In the 1800s, the
Methodist community
were worshipping in a building on the Balk and in 1856 they built an additional small chapel on Shay Lane. When opened, St. Paul's Church on the Balk was dedicated to the
Bishop of Wakefield
, its construction was financed by the Simpson family, who also provided the land.  The village is in the Church of England Parish of Sandal Magna.
In 1896, with the village population on the increase, larger premises were needed for the Methodist congregation and a bigger chapel was built. The design incorporated the original building and in 1910, extra
Sunday school
rooms were added.
[7]
Colliery
[
edit
]
Walton Colliery was the site of an explosion on 22 April 1959 that killed five men.
[8]
The pit closed on 3 December 1979, leading to the loss of 550 locally.  This was planned to be one of the first en-bloc transfers of miners from an exhausted colliery to the new
Selby Coalfield
, but only around half of the workforce (excluding those that chose redundancy) moved to the Selby Coalfield.  The remaining miners transferred to similar work at Ackton Hall, Allerton Bywater and Nostell Collieries immediately, and often later to Selby when those pits closed.
[9]
Before closure, Walton Colliery had been saved several times by industrial action. In 1977 it was reported to require investment of £5 million to open new faces, which was rejected by the
Coal Board
, but
Arthur Scargill
refused to accept the closure of a pit where the coal was not yet exhausted.
[10]
War memorial
[
edit
]
At the centre of the village, at the
junction
of School Lane (B6378) and Shay Lane, a
war memorial
lists the names of local men who died serving in the
First
and
Second World Wars
.

Sergipe
(
Brazilian Portuguese:
[sɛʁˈʒipi]
ⓘ
), officially
State of Sergipe
, is a
state
of
Brazil
. Located in the
Northeast Region
along the
Atlantic
coast of the country, Sergipe is the smallest state in Brazil by geographical area at 21,910 square kilometres (8,460 sq mi), larger only than the
Federal District
. Sergipe borders
Bahia
to the south and west and
Alagoas
to the north.
Aracaju
is the capital and the largest city in the state; the state is divided into 75
municipalities
. The state has 1.1% of the Brazilian population and produces only 0.6% of the Brazilian
GDP
.
[3]
Geography
[
edit
]
As with most of the states in northeastern Brazil, inland Sergipe is almost entirely
savanna
(
caatinga
), and its coastline is characterized by
mangroves
,
swamps
and sandy
beaches
. A small strip of
tropical rainforest
runs down the coast.
Aerial tramway
in Aracaju.
The
São Francisco River
forms its northern boundary, and the drainage of the northern part of the state is northward and eastward to that river. The southern half of the state slopes eastward and is drained directly into the Atlantic through a number of small rivers, the largest of which are the Irapiranga (whose source in the state of Bahia is called Vaza Barris), the
Real
and the
Cotinguiba
. These streams are navigable for short distances, but are obstructed by
sandbars at their mouths
; because of these, there are no good ports on the coast. The surface of the state resembles, in part, that of Bahia, with a zone of forested lands near the coast and beyond this forested zone lies a higher zone of rough open country, called
agreste
. There is a sandy belt along the coast, and the western frontier is slightly mountainous. The land in between is very fertile, especially in the forested region where rainfall is abundant. Further inland, the year is divided into wet and dry seasons with occasional prolonged droughts. These are
pastoral
areas, and the lower fertile lands are cultivated.
[4]

Aracaju
.
The capital of the state is
Aracaju
(pop. 479 767 in 2003), on the lower course or
estuary
of the Cotinguiba River, near the coast. The sandbar at the entrance to this river is exceptionally dangerous, and the port is frequented only by coasting vessels of light
draught
. The city is found on a sandy plain, and there are sand dunes within the city limits. In 1911, the main public buildings included a large plain church with unfinished twin towers, the government palace, the legislative halls, a public school and public hospital.
[4]
The other principal towns are
Estância
- pop. 62,218 (in 2005) on the Rio Real river in the southern part of the state and a center for the manufacturing of cotton-based textiles, cigars, cigarettes and
soap
as well as an active trade center;
Laranjeiras
- pop. 26,452 (in 2005), located in a highly productive sugar-growing district north of the capital;
Capela
- pop. 27,403 (in 2005);
Simão Dias
- pop. 39,706 (in 2005);
Lagarto
- pop. 90,345 (in 2005);
São Cristóvão
, formerly Sergipe d'el-Rey - pop. 75,353 (in 2005), which was also the old colonial capital near the mouth of the Irapiranga.

History
[
edit
]
Royal decree of King John VI, granting the administrative emancipation of the Captaincy of Sergipe on July 8, 1820.
Aracaju-Barra Bridge at night.
Present-day Sergipe was home to numerous indigenous peoples, including the Kanindé (Canindé),
Aratus
, and
Tupi peoples
.
Gaspar de Lemos
briefly landed in the region in 1501, and the Portuguese Crown declared the region part of the
Captaincy of Bahia
.
São Cristóvão
was the site of the first
Portuguese
settlement, in 1591, at Sergipe D'El-Rey.
As with other states in the northeast, Sergipe was invaded numerous times by the
Dutch
, and frequently raided by French
buccaneers
. During the 17th century, the state was known throughout the Americas for its
king-wood
, a prized commodity that was the primary attraction during the buccaneer raids, and probably a factor in Dutch military expeditions. From 1641 to 1645, the territory belonged to Dutch-controlled Brazil (
New Holland
). The Dutch built a fort, the first in the region, between the rivers São Francisco and Sergipe.
The Portuguese regained control in 1645. By the 18th century, the Portuguese military had driven off the pirates permanently. Sergipe remained a part of the state of Bahia, and was responsible for a third of Bahia's sugar production by 1723. Sugarcane culture was established in the valleys of the São Francisco, Japaratuba, Sergipe, Vaza-Barris, Piauí and Real rivers. Areas unsuitable for sugarcane plantations on the coast and in the hinterland were developed for livestock; Sergipe subsequently became a supplier of draft animals for the farms of Bahia and Pernambuco. The region was also a significant producer of leather.
John VI of Portugal
signed a decree to separated Sergipe from Bahia on July 8, 1820, and Brigadier Carlos César Burlamárqui was named the state's first governor.
[3]
Sergipe retained its separation from Bahia after the
Independence of Brazil
in 1822, first briefly as the Captaincy of Sergipe, then as the Province of Sergipe. Economic development was low during the
Empire of Brazil
in the 19th century, other than a brief cotton boom in the second half of the century. The provincial president Inácio Joaquim Barbosa moved the capital from inland São Cristóvão to coastal
Aracaju
on the coast on March 17, 1855. Sergipe became a state under the proclamation of the Republic of Brazil in 1892.
20th century
[
edit
]
The state saw bitter political disputes in the early 20th century, notably between
Fausto Cardoso
(1864-1906) and Olímpio Campos. Sergipe became notorious for its outlaws in the 1930s, including Virgolino Ferreira da Silva, better known as
Lampião
, the "King of Bandits", who terrorized the state for almost a decade until his beheading by the Brazilian police in 1938. His head was later displayed on a pole in a village square.
Coastal Sergipe was attacked by
Nazi Germany
at the beginning of
World War II
in response to the rupture of relations between Brazil and the
Axis powers
. The
German submarine U-507
, commanded by
Harro Schacht
, attacked the
Baependi
,
Araraquara
, and
Aníbal Benévolo
[
pt
]
off Sergipe between August 15 and 16, 1942. The shipwrecks caused approximately 600 civilian deaths, and German and Italian immigrants communities in Sergipe were persecuted after the attack by mobs. The attacks of the U-507 prompted President Getúlio Vargas to declare war on Germany and Italy on August 22 of the same year.

As a planned urban settlement, the town contains churches and religious ensembles dating back to the colonial period. Most of these monuments are concentrated around the São Francisco Square.
In 1939, São Cristóvão was designated as a National Treasure by the Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional — IPHAN (the Brazilian National Historical and Artistical Heritage Institute). More recently, in 2010, São Francisco Square in the Town of São Cristóvão became a
UNESCO World Heritage Site

Xingó
Canyon
.
São Francisco
river
.
Includes fascinating landscape, rock formations, crystal-clear waters, ecological trails, Caatinga Theme Park, exuberant vegetation and diversified fauna and flora. The Xingó Canyon is located in Canindé do São Francisco, on the banks of the lengthy and well-known São Francisco river. It is the world's fifth most navigable river. The river is formed in a valley reaching up to 170 m deep, being 65 km long and at certain locations between 50 and 300 m wide. The water volume of the canyon is about 3.8 billion m
3
.
[16]
To navigate between the rocks of this gigantic cliff, embedded in the middle of Sergipe's Alto Sertão, is an unforgettable experience.  There are imposing valleys forming a 50 m-high canyon, surrounding a lake that, in certain points, reaches a depth of 190 m.  Nests of herons and river islands complete the spectacle.  The rocks guard traces of the area's first inhabitants who lived there more than 8,000 years ago.
There is also evidence of Lampião's stay there, with his gang of outlaws in more modern times. The Angico trail, in Poço Redondo, leads to a cavern by the same name, where Lampião, Maria Bonita and nine other outlaws lost their lives. Located in the town of Canindé do São Francisco, 213 km (132 mi) from Aracaju, Xingó Canyon is one of the most famous rock formations in the area, embellishing the landscape of the dry Northeastern backwoods. It is hot all year round, but strong winds blowing from December to January keep temperatures at a very comfortable level. Between May and August, it rains frequently.
Sergipe Beaches
[
edit
]
Sergipe has an extensive coastline where it is very attractive for tourists from Brazil and the world. The clear and greenish waters, with white sand attract attention. The capital
Aracaju
also stands out for Praia de Atalaia which is considered the beach with the best beach sidewalk in Brazil. Outside the capital, the coast of Sergipe is highly valued for its distinctive aspect: Praia do Saco (municipality of
Estância
), a beach located in the south of the state was considered one of the 100 best beaches in the world by the French magazine
Les Voyageurs
. In it the tourist is faced with
sand dunes
and an extensive coastal strip that has the peculiarity of Sergipe; Praia da Costa (
Barra dos Coqueiros
), the Delta of the
São Francisco River
(
Brejo Grande
), Praia de Pirambu (
Pirambu
), are other beaches that enhance the state's tourism.
The river beaches, such as the Croa do Goré sandbar and Ilha dos Namorados, which are tourist attractions reached by Catamaran on the
Vaza Barris River
in Aracaju, can also be highlighted.
Flag
[
edit
]
The stars on the flag of Sergipe represent the number of
river
estuaries
in the state, and the green and yellow stripes represent Sergipe's union with the rest of Brazil. It was designed by José Rodrigues Bastos Coelho, a businessman who felt that Brazilian
ships
should carry flags to identify their state of origin. It was officially adopted on October 19, 1920.
In 1937, dictator
Getúlio Vargas
abolished all state flags and symbols, but they were allowed again in 1946. In 1951, when the Sergipe legislature began to consider restoring the state flag, it decided to change the number of stars, so that there would be one for every
municipality
in the state. In 1952, this new design was scrapped and replaced by the original 5-star design.

Location of Raul Soares within Minas Gerais
Raul Soares
is a
Brazilian
municipality
located in the state of
Minas Gerais
. The
city
belongs to the
mesoregion
of
Zona da Mata
and extends to the microregion of
Ponte Nova
.  As of 2020, the estimated population was 23,711.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The Boachás, who populated the rich mountains near the river that inherited their name, were the first people to settle in the area.
The pioneers Domingos de Lana and Cassimiro de Lana arrived in Raul Soares on January 20, 1837, from
Mariana
.  Upon their arrival, they expelled the native population, and took possession of the mountains. In 1841, the territory was sold to Francisco Alves do Vale, who settled there with his family. According to a deed dated October 29, 1873, João Pinto de Oliveira, a wealthy man, donated five acres of land. The village formed out of this land was called São Sebastião do Entre Rios for its location between the Matipó and
Santana rivers
. The town grew slowly and in 1902, the district of Rio Casca was formed.
The creation of the
municipality
of Raul Soares was authorised by State Law No. 843 on September 7, 1923, and the region became formally known as
Matipó
. Initially, the consolidation council was composed of individuals who would exercise
executive
and
legislative powers
. But as the Mayor and City Council formed with the people's
consent
, a broader
municipality
was created.  In 1924, the local council accepted the name for the area as Raul Soares, in honour of then Governor of State, Dr. Raul Soares de Moura.
[2]
[3]
The new municipality was formally installed on January 20, 1924, under the direction of the first elected councilmen and with the creation of the first town hall. Joaquim Miracles Sobrinho (who chaired the inaugural session as the most voted alderman), João Domingos da Silva, Raphael Raymundo Coelho, José Maria de Souza, Francisco Costa Abrantes, Joaquim José da Silveira and Carlos Gomes Brandão were members of governing body of the new council. Councilman Raymundo Raphael Coelho was the
chairman
of the elected municipal council. At that time there was no
mayor
and the president of the chamber had to perform both functions.  January 20 was celebrated as independence day, and is the anniversary of the emancipation policy. On September 19, 1924, the administrative council changed the day's name to Matipó of Raul Soares. It is also the day of patron saint
San Sebastian
.
[4]
After Oliveria's death in 1925, his children - José, Jacó, Francisco and Manoel Alves do Vale - donated part of the land to create the chapel of St. Sebastian (Minas Gerais). The original chapel was founded by Father Francisco Antonio de Carvalho, a vicar of
São Pedro dos Ferros
, who later moved to live near the church.
The city serves as headquarters of the manufacturing company St. Sebastian Industrial SA. The region is also a significant producer of
coffee
. A considerable portion of the area's industrial and agricultural output is exported worldwide.

History
[
edit
]
The history of Emprise Bank began in 1910 with the formation of Stockyards National Bank in Wichita, Kansas. In 1965, W.A. Michaelis, Jr. purchased Sierra Petroleum Co. Inc., which owned Stockyards National Bank.  In the early 1970s, Stockyards Bank was renamed United American Bank & Trust Company to reflect the bank’s expansion into other parts of the city. Sierra later became Emprise Financial Corporation.
Over the next 25 years, the Michaelis family acquired banks in communities across the state including Council Grove, Eureka, Hays, Hillsboro, Iola, Moran, Toronto, and Potwin.  During this period, the Michaelis Family also acquired the National Bank of Wichita and Wichita State Bank.
In 1989, the banks located in Wichita were merged and the combined institution was named Emprise Bank. The Michaelis family’s banks throughout the state were aligned geographically and merged to form four community bank charters. These banks were renamed Emprise Bank. In the early 1990s, Emprise expanded into Lawrence and added branch locations in the Wichita area. Emprise Bank then acquired Wichita Federal Savings & Loan in the mid 1990s, which increased the bank’s market share and doubled its asset size.
In 2002, Emprise opened a location in El Dorado, and in 2003 locations were acquired in Humboldt and Chanute. Over the next two years, the community banks were all merged under one Emprise Bank charter. Then, in November 2006, Emprise Bank merged with Prairie State Bank, adding eleven additional branches to the Emprise network and increasing the number of employees to nearly 500. Through the merger, Emprise Bank reached $1 billion in total assets.
The Art of Emprise
[
edit
]
The Art of Emprise is a collection of art owned by the bank. The collection showcases pieces from Kansas artists and now includes works from more than 530 artists. Many of these pieces come from students and faculty at colleges and universities across the state.
In 1980, the Kansas Watercolor Society asked the Emprise Bank to sponsor its annual show; the bank agreed, and began making patron purchases on behalf of the banks. They have continued this sponsorship since, and expanded the Art of Emprise collection well beyond watercolors. Originally, the focus was simply finding unique pieces of art, but that focus changed to include artists with a Kansas connection.
The art is available to be viewed at Emprise Bank locations, as well as some other locations. Works of the collection have been displayed at the Andover Library (
Andover, Kan.
), Beach Museum (
Manhattan, Kan.
), Coutts Art Museum (
El Dorado, Kan.
),
Lawrence Arts Center
, Ulrich Museum, and the
Wichita Art Museum
. The collection has also been shared with the U.S.
Art in Embassies Program
, having works displayed in
Belize
and
Uzbekistan
.
Controversy
[
edit
]
The bank received media attention in September 2017 after having an Iraqi-American family arrested. Sattar Ali, a doctoral student who had lived in the United States since 1993, tried to deposit a check for $151,000 at Emprise. This sum had been obtained from the sale of their old home in Michigan.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
With insufficient verification documents, Ali was handcuffed and had his belongings confiscated after the bank called the police. 4 police cars arrived to arrest Ali
[6]
at around 11.30am. Police also arrested Ali's wife and 15-year-old daughter, who had been waiting for him in the car outside. Police also called the school of Ali's 11-year-old son to have him detained there while the rest of his family was in custody.
[5]
Wichita police were able to confirm that the check was legitimate, 48 minutes after the arrest,
[7]
and released the family around 3.00pm.
[1]
“We were devastated. Terrified. Crying the whole time,” Ali said. “We had no idea what the arrest was for.” Emprise claimed that the police were called as the bank had trouble verifying the check.
[1]
[2]
Emprise Bank released a statement regarding this incident indicating that they saw nothing wrong with the bank branch's action:
[5]
".. We are aware of a situation at the 21st and Woodlawn branch yesterday and can confirm that our team acted in accordance with our policies and procedures. If faced with the same circumstances today, we would expect our team to take the same actions."
Ali said in an interview that this had been an example of racial profiling, and questioned why his family had also been arrested: “Let’s assume I made a mistake and gave them a bad check,” Ali said. “Why would they arrest my wife and daughter?”
[1]
Ali stated that he had plans to take legal action against the bank for the incident.
[3]
[4]
The bank subsequently issued an apology:
[7]
"Bank Chairman Matthew Michealis says the bank is sorry for the incident that occurred on Sept. 6 when a teller called 911
[8]
after saying Sattar Ali was trying to deposit a fraudulent $150,000 check.
In his statement, Michaelis says the bank will "conduct a complete review of the incident" with all parties involved. He says Emprise Bank staff will now participate in sensitivity training.
"At Emprise, we believe that what we do and say is a reflection of who we are. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind," said Michaelis in the statement."
As of 2018, Ali and Emprise have "reached an amicable resolution regarding the incident" outside of court.

Malawian gender activist and politician
Catherine Mary Ajizinga Chipembere
(b 1935) is a Malawian gender activist and politician.
[1]
She was born in 1935 in Malawi.
[2]
She was the wife of Malawian nationalist
Henry Masauko Chipembere
and is the mother of the internationally known jazz artist
Masauko Chipembere Jr
. She was exiled to the US from Malawi together with her husband, and later returned to Malawi and was the first woman elected to Malawi Parliament.
[3]
She currently works with AIDS orphans and runs twelve pre-schools, serving more than 1,000 AIDS orphans.
[4]
She also runs a women's knitting cooperative in
Mangochi
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Chipembere attended secondary school during a time when education was not considered a priority for Malawian girls. She won a scholarship to study domestic science in England.
[2]
She met and married the Malawi nationalist
Henry Masauko Chipembere
when she returned to Malawi. She fled with their seven children to the United States under exile, after the dictatorial
Kamuzu Banda
severed their relationship with her husband. Masauko Chipembere died in the United States in 1975 from diabetes.
[2]
Chipembere went on to pursue and earn a bachelor's degree in early childhood education from the
University of California at Los Angeles
. She also operated a childcare facility in her home and raised her own children.
[2]
Political life
[
edit
]
Catherine Chipembere was forced into exile from Malawi together with her husband and lived outside the country for 29 years. In 1994, after the end of Banda's rule, she returned to Malawi as a hero. She was elected as the first female member of the Malawian parliament.
[2]
Later she served as the first deputy minister of education, science and technology and then as deputy minister of health and population.
[2]
She was able to use her degree to oversee primary and secondary school education.
[2]
She retired from her political career in 1998 and started the "Women's Initiative Network".
[4]
In a widely publicised move, she decided to keep her husband's surname in spite of remarrying, as a political statement.
[1]
She was sued by the Chipembere family for maintaining her Chipembere surname.
[1]
Although ultimately winning the case, Catherine was removed from her post and residence in the government sector in 1998 by the Muluzi government.
[1]
Women's Initiative Network
[
edit
]
The Women's Initiative Network (WIN) is a non-profit network of Malawian women that holds empowerment workshops for young women which are led by her. The network collaborated with non-profit organisations like
Global Soles
in the US to bring shoes for orphans in Malawi in 2009.
[5]
WIN Malawi operates in rural Mangochi and has built and sponsored twelve primary schools that educate, feed and care for over a thousand orphans.
[6]
Most of the children are between two and six years old.
[6]
Several of the orphans are AIDS orphans.
[6]
Personal life
[
edit
]
In what ensued as a public scandal and a celebrated court case, the Chipembere clan sued Catherine for maintaining her Chipembere surname, though she remarried. She won this case and she was able to keep the surname as a political widow.
She has seven children, including jazz musician
Masauko Chipembere Jr
.

The
Star Trek Concordance
is a
reference
book
by
Bjo Trimble
about the
television series
Star Trek
.  The first edition was self-published in 1969.  A mass-market edition was published in 1976.  The 1976 edition contains summaries from every episode of
The Original Series
and
The Animated Series
, as well as an encyclopedia of characters and technology from the series. It was used as a reference (
show bible
) for later writers of the show.
History
[
edit
]
The
Concordance
originated as a privately printed fandom publication by
Dorothy Jones Heydt
in 1968.
[1]
Originally, Heydt compiled notes on 3x5 notecards. Trimble suggested they write a book, and as the pair watched episodes on
television
, as well as on an early
VCR
, they made notes on which the book was based.
[2]
In 1969, Trimble edited and self-published
The Star Trek Concordance
, covering the first two years of the series.
[3]
In the Introduction to the Ballantine
Concordance
Trimble explains the origins of the book:
About midway through the first season of
Star Trek
, I noticed that Dorothy Jones [Heydt], a fellow fan, was making extensive notes on the show, with cross-references to items and things mentioned, lists of who played what part, and so on. It seemed too interesting merely to keep in a file box, so I suggested that we share it with other fans.
[4]
A supplement covering the third season was subsequently published in 1973.
In 1976, Ballantine published the first publicly distributed edition of the Concordance.  At one time, the Ballantine edition was the best-selling
trade edition book
published in the United States. But due to Ballantine's concerns, at the time, of waning interest in
Star Trek
, it was decided to not reprint the book.
[5]
[6]
An updated edition of the book would not be reprinted until 1995.
Overview
[
edit
]
Integrated into the front cover is a moving wheel which cross-references episodes by title, star date, "call letters" and page in the book. This facilitates finding episodes in the book.
Bjo Trimble dedicates the book to three men, one of them series creator
Gene Roddenberry
. She wrote, "Dedicated to... Gene Roddenberry for creating Star Trek in the first place."
[4]
There is also an introduction by Trimble where she explains how the book was developed and acknowledges those who assisted her. The preface by Dorothy Jones Heydt, dated June 1968, follows. In it Heydt explains her contribution to the
Concordance
, as well as Roddenberry's concept of the
stardate
:
A function of space as well as time, being influenced by a starship's position in the galaxy, its course and velocity.
[4]
True to its origins in fandom, the Fan Art chapter contains several fan drawings depicting
U.S.S.
Enterprise
personnel
,
aliens
, other characters and
Star Fleet insignias
.
The Timeline chapter features an
episode timeline
in tabular format listing each episode by its stardate and page number. The first episode listed in the Timeline is "
The Magicks of Megas-tu
", stardate 1254.4, and the last episode is "
Bem
", stardate 7403.6.
The Summaries part of the book contains the following chapters:
First Season
,
Second Season
,
Third Season
, and
Animateds
. A detailed plot summary and list of characters are provided for each episode. The first summary is "
The Man Trap
", air date September 8, 1966. The last summary is "
The Counter-Clock Incident
", air date October 12, 1974. The animated chapter is illustrated, unlike the live action chapters.
The Lexicon chapter is an extensive and exhaustive alphabetical encyclopedia of
characters
, planets, ships,
medicine
,
weaponry
, etc., used in the series. It is also illustrated. Some entries in the Lexicon are provided for context. For example, there is an entry for author
Lewis Carroll
, even though he doesn't appear in the series. His entry appears thus:
Carroll, Lewis
pseud. of Charles Lutwidge Dodson (1832-98): English writer best remembered for his famous children's books
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
(1865) and its sequel,
Through the Looking Glass
both illustrated by
Sir John Tenniel

According to
Richard Arnold
, at the time he came to
Paramount
in the mid-70s,
The Making of Star Trek
and the
Concordance
were the only references in use.
[9]
Trimble is acknowledged by the authors of
The Star Trek Encyclopedia
and
Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology
as a research consultant. Trimble said in 1999,
I didn't help write them, if that's what you mean. I certainly was available for phone calls on questions of what happened, or where something was (in the hands of what collector), and so on. I send (sic) many of my own notes to Mike (a long-time and very dear friend). He always acknowledged me, which was much appreciated, since many other writers who used my information never did. Especially the fiction writers, all of whom certainly used the
Concordance
.
[2]
The
Concordance
contained errors, according to Arnold. For example,
Susan Howard
from the "
Day of the Dove
" episode was accidentally omitted. This error would be reproduced later in
The Star Trek Compendium
and wouldn't be corrected until the second edition.

History
[
edit
]
Earlswood station was opened by the
London Brighton and South Coast Railway
on 1 August 1868.
[3]
The station was rebuilt with four platforms in 1906 at the time of the quadrupling of the main line. The platforms on the fast lines were closed in the 1980s.
On 11 January 2016, payment using Oyster and contactless payment cards was introduced at the station, as part of the Oyster extension from Merstham to Gatwick Airport. The station is outside the London Fare Zone area, and special fares apply.
Some Oyster photocards (as well as Freedom Passes) are not valid here: the nearest station that these cards can be used is
Coulsdon South
, only in the northbound direction.

The
Naval Aircraft Factory
TS-1
was an early
biplane
fighter aircraft
of the
United States Navy
, serving from 1922 to 1929.
Development
[
edit
]
While the
Vought VE-7s
were serving the Navy well in the early 1920s, they were not originally designed as fighters. The
Naval Aircraft Factory
came up with a simple design driven by a 200
hp
(150
kW
)
Lawrance J-1
air-cooled
radial engine
. Its boxy
fuselage
was suspended between the upper and lower wings (essentially having both dorsal
and
ventral sets of
cabane struts
), with the center area of the lower wing enlarged to accommodate a fuel tank.
[2]
The NAF provided
Curtiss
with the plans to build the aircraft, and the result, designated
TS-1
, arrived at
Anacostia
on May 9, 1922. The TS-1 from Curtiss was delivered with
wheels
, so the NAF also designed wooden floats to enable their use on vessels other than
aircraft carriers
. Testing went well, and in late 1922 the Navy ordered 34 planes from Curtiss, with the first arriving on board the aircraft carrier
USS
Langley
in December. The NAF built another five themselves, as a test of relative costs, as well as four more used to experiment with water-cooled
inline engines
.
[2]
Two all-metal versions of the aircraft, F4C-1s, were developed by Curtiss. This aircraft made its first flight on September 4, 1924. The wings had tubular spars and stamped
duraluminum
ribs, the fuselage was constructed of duraluminum tubing in a Warren truss form. Compared to the TS-1, the lower wing was raised to the base of the fuselage. The F4C-1 was armed with two .30 in (7.62 mm) machine guns and was powered by a 200 hp nine-cylinder Wright J-3 radial.
Operational history
[
edit
]
In addition to operating from the carrier deck, the TS-1s served for several years in floatplane configuration aboard
destroyers
,
cruisers
, and
battleships
. The aircraft were slung over the side by
crane
or launched from capital ship catapults. Squadron
VO-1
operated this way from 1922, and
VF-1
flew its float-equipped TS-1s from battleships in 1925 and 1926.
[3]
The TS-1 was not universally liked by its crews. Positioning of the lower wing below the fuselage resulted in short wheel struts. This, and the wheels' placement close to each other, caused considerable problems with
ground looping
.

light-years
.
[1]
It has a heliocentric

.
[7]
It shines with a
luminosity
55 times greater than the
Sun

K
.
[7]
HD 83380 is slightly metal enriched with a
metallicity
126% that of the
Sun
.
[7]
It spins with a
projected rotational velocity
too low to be measured accurately,
[8]
and is believed to be a member of the
thin disk population
.
[11]
The multiplicity status of HD 83380 isn't generally agreed on. De Mederios et al. (2014) found it to be a probable
spectroscopic binary
[8]

USCGC
Raymond Evans
is the tenth vessel in the
United States Coast Guard
's
Sentinel-class
cutter
.
[3]
[4]
All the vessels are named after members of the Coast Guard, or its precursor services, who are remembered for their heroism.
Names had already been assigned for the first fourteen vessels, when
Commander
Raymond Evans
died, and the USCG Commandant announced that the next Sentinel class cutter would be named after him.
Joseph Napier
, who was originally scheduled to be the namesake of the tenth vessel, had his name moved to the beginning of the second list of heroes names, and will now be the namesake of the fifteenth vessel.
The vessel was delivered to the Coast Guard, for pre-commissioning trials, on June 25, 2014.
[1]
[3]
[4]
On August 20, 2014, an open house was held to allow residents of
Key West, Florida
to tour the vessel.
[5]
The vessel was commissioned on September 6, 2014.
[2]
[6]
[7]
[8]
Design
[
edit
]
The
Sentinel-class
cutters
were designed to replace the shorter 110-foot (34 m)
Island-class
patrol boats
.
[9]
Raymond Evans
is equipped with a remote-control 25 mm
Bushmaster autocannon
and four, crew-served
M2HB
.50-caliber machine guns. It has a
bow thruster
for maneuvering in crowded anchorages and channels. It also has small underwater fins for coping with the rolling and pitching caused by large waves. It is equipped with a
stern launching ramp
, like the
Marine Protector-class
and the eight failed expanded Island-class cutters. It has a
complement
of twenty-two crew members. Like the Marine Protector class, and the cancelled extended Island-class cutters, the Sentinel-class cutters deploy the
Short Range Prosecutor
Rigid-hulled inflatable
(SRP or RHIB) in rescues and interceptions.
[10]
According to
Marine Log
, modifications to the Coast Guard vessels from the Stan 4708 design include an increase in speed from 23 to 28 knots (43 to 52 km/h; 26 to 32 mph), fixed-pitch rather than variable-pitch propellers, stern launch capability, and watertight bulkheads.
[11]
Raymond Evans
has an overall length of 153 feet 6 inches (46.79 m), a
beam
of 25 feet (7.6 m), and a displacement of 325 long tons (330 t; 364 short tons). Its
draft
is 9 feet 6 inches (2.90 m) and it has a maximum speed of over 28 knots (52 km/h; 32 mph). The Sentinel-class cutters have endurances of five days and a range of 2,950 nautical miles (3,390 mi; 5,460 km).
[9]
Career
[
edit
]
In early January, while operating off the coast of
Guyana
with
USCGC
Stone
(WMSL-758)
,
Raymond Evans
boarded
a suspected narcotics trafficking vessel. After testing the packages found on board, 970 kilograms of cocaine were recovered and the suspected traffickers were detained.

represented the 13th district
in the
Illinois Senate
from 1997 until 2004, when he
successfully ran for the U.S. Senate
. In 2008, after
a close primary campaign
against
Hillary Clinton
, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose
Joe Biden
as his running mate. Obama was elected president, defeating
Republican
nominee
John McCain
in the
presidential election
and was
inaugurated
on January 20, 2009. Nine months later he was named the
2009 Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.
Obama's first-term actions addressed the
global financial crisis
and included a
major stimulus package
to guide the economy to recover from the
Great Recession
, a partial extension of
George W. Bush
's
tax cuts
,
legislation to reform health care
, a major
financial regulation reform bill
, and the end of a major U.S.
military presence in Iraq
. Obama also appointed
Supreme Court
justices
Sonia Sotomayor
and
Elena Kagan
, the former being the first
Hispanic American
on the Supreme Court. He ordered
the counterterrorism raid
which killed
Osama bin Laden
and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. Obama also ordered
military involvement in Libya
in order to implement
UN Security Council Resolution 1973
, contributing to the overthrow of
Muammar Gaddafi
.
After winning
re-election
by defeating Republican opponent
Mitt Romney
, Obama was
sworn in for a second term
on January 20, 2013. In his second term, Obama took steps to
combat climate change
, signing a
major international climate agreement
and an
executive order
to limit
carbon emissions
. Obama also presided over the implementation of the
Affordable Care Act
and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a
nuclear agreement
with Iran and
normalized relations with Cuba
. The number of
American soldiers
in
Afghanistan
fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout
Obama's presidency
. Obama promoted inclusion for
LGBT Americans
, culminating in the
Supreme Court
's decision to strike down
same-sex marriage
bans as unconstitutional in
Obergefell v. Hodges
.
Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C.
His presidential library
in Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections, such as his former vice president
Joe Biden
in his
successful bid
for president in
2020
. Outside of politics, Obama has published three
bestselling books
:
Dreams from My Father
(1995)
,
The Audacity of Hope
(2006) and
A Promised Land
(2020).

Early life and career of Barack Obama
Obama (right) with grandfather
Stanley Armour Dunham
, mother
Ann Dunham
, and half-sister
Maya Soetoro
, mid-1970s in
Honolulu
Obama was born on August 4, 1961,
[5]
at
Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children
in
Honolulu
, Hawaii.
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
He is the only president born outside the
contiguous 48 states
.
[10]
He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother,
Ann Dunham
(1942-1995), was born in
Wichita, Kansas
and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of
Moneygall, Ireland
to the US in 1850.
[11]
In July 2012,
Ancestry.com
found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from
John Punch
, an enslaved African man who lived in the
Colony of Virginia
during the seventeenth century.
[12]
[13]
Obama's father,
Barack Obama Sr.
(1934-1982),
[14]
[15]
was a married
[16]
[17]
[18]
Luo Kenyan
from
Nyang'oma Kogelo
.
[16]
[19]
His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.
[20]
Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the
University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa
, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.
[21]
[22]
The couple married in
Wailuku, Hawaii
, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.
[23]
[24]
In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the
University of Washington
in
Seattle
, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at
Harvard University
, where he earned an
M.A.
in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.
[25]
Obama Sr. returned to
Kenya
in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.
[26]
He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,
[27]
before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.
[28]
Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind."
[22]
He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.
[29]
In 1963, Dunham met
Lolo Soetoro
at the
University of Hawaii
; he was an
Indonesian
East-West Center
graduate student
in
geography
. The couple married on
Molokai
on March 15, 1965.
[30]
After two one-year extensions of his
J-1 visa
, Lolo returned to
Indonesia
in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the
Tebet
district of
South Jakarta
. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the
Menteng
district of
Central Jakarta
.
[31]
Education
Obama's Indonesian school record in St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School. Obama was enrolled as "Barry Soetoro" (no. 1), and was wrongly recorded as an Indonesian citizen (no. 3) and a Muslim (no. 4).
[32]
At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as "Barry"
[32]
and attended local
Indonesian-language
schools:
Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi
(St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and
Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01
(State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language
Calvert School
homeschooling by his mother.
[33]
[34]
As a result of his four years in
Jakarta
, he was able to speak
Indonesian
fluently as a child.
[35]
During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him "a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works".
[36]
In 1971, Obama returned to
Honolulu
to live with his maternal grandparents,
Madelyn
and
Stanley Dunham
. He attended
Punahou School
—a private
college preparatory school
—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.
[37]
In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname "Barry" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.
[38]
Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,
Maya Soetoro
, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in
anthropology
at the
University of Hawaii
.
[39]
Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.
[40]
His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for
ovarian
and
uterine cancer
.
[41]
Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear."
[42]
Obama has also written and talked about using
alcohol
,
marijuana
, and
cocaine
during his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind".
[43]
Obama was also a member of the "Choom Gang" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.
[44]
[45]
College and research jobs
After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend
Occidental College
on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the
disinvestment from South Africa
in response to that nation's policy of
apartheid
.
[46]
In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in
Pakistan
for three weeks.
[46]
Later in 1981, he
transferred
to
Columbia University
in New York City as a
junior
, where he majored in
political science
with a specialty in
international relations
[47]
and in
English literature
[48]
and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.
[49]
He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7
GPA
. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the
Business International Corporation
, where he was a financial researcher and writer,
[50]
[51]
then as a project coordinator for the
New York Public Interest Research Group
on the
City College of New York
campus for three months in 1985.
[52]
[53]
[54]
Community organizer and Harvard Law School
Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the
Developing Communities Project
, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in
Roseland
,
West Pullman
, and
Riverdale
on Chicago's
South Side
. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.
[53]
[55]
He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in
Altgeld Gardens
.
[56]
Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the
Gamaliel Foundation
, a community organizing institute.
[57]
In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in
Europe
for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his
paternal relatives
for the first time.

Despite being offered a full scholarship to
Northwestern University School of Law
, Obama enrolled at
Harvard Law School
in the fall of 1988, living in nearby
Somerville, Massachusetts
.
[61]
He was selected as an editor of the
Harvard Law Review
at the end of his first year,
[62]
president of the journal in his second year,
[56]
[63]
and research assistant to the constitutional scholar

[64]
During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a
summer associate
at the law firms of
Sidley Austin
in 1989 and
Hopkins & Sutter
in 1990.
[65]
Obama's election as the
first black president of the
Harvard Law Review
gained national media attention
[56]
[63]
and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,
[66]
which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as
Dreams from My Father
.
[66]
Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a
Juris Doctor
magna cum laude
.

In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the
University of Chicago Law School
to work on his first book.
[66]
[68]
He then taught
constitutional law
at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.
[69]
From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's
Project Vote
, a
voter registration campaign
with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading
Crain's Chicago Business
to name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.

Family and personal life
Main article:
Family of Barack Obama
In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of
his extended family
: "It's like a little mini-United Nations," he said. "I've got relatives who look like
Bernie Mac
, and I've got relatives who look like
Margaret Thatcher
."
[71]
Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (
Maya Soetoro-Ng
) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living.
[72]
Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,
Madelyn Dunham
,
[73]
until her death on November 2, 2008,
[74]
two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in
Moneygall
in May 2011.
[75]
In
Dreams from My Father
, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of
Jefferson Davis
,
President of the Confederate States of America
during the
American Civil War
. He also shares distant ancestors in common with
George W. Bush
and
Dick Cheney
, among others.
[76]
[77]
[78]
Obama lived with anthropologist
Sheila Miyoshi Jager
while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.
[79]
He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.
[79]
[80]
The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.
[80]
Obama poses in the
Green Room
of the White House with wife
Michelle
and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009.
In June 1989, Obama met
Michelle Robinson
when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of
Sidley Austin
.
[81]
Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.
[82]
They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.
[83]
After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent
in vitro fertilization
to conceive their children.
[84]
The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,
[85]
followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001.
[86]
The Obama daughters attended the
University of Chicago Laboratory Schools
. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the
Sidwell Friends School
.
[87]
The Obamas had two
Portuguese Water Dogs
; the first, a male named
Bo
, was a gift from Senator
Ted Kennedy
.
[88]
In 2013, Bo was joined by
Sunny
, a female.
[89]
Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.
[90]
Obama is a supporter of the
Chicago White Sox
, and he threw out the first pitch at the
2005 ALCS
when he was still a senator.
[91]
In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the
All-Star Game
while wearing a White Sox jacket.
[92]
He is also primarily a
Chicago Bears
football fan in the
NFL
, but in his childhood and adolescence was a
fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers
, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in
Super Bowl XLIII
12 days after he took office as president.
[93]
In 2011, Obama invited the
1985 Chicago Bears
to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their
Super Bowl win
in 1986 due to the
Space Shuttle Challenger disaster
.
[94]
He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,
[95]
and he is left-handed.
[96]
In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a
Hyde Park, Chicago
condominium to a $1.6
million house (equivalent to $2.4
million in 2022) in neighboring
Kenwood, Chicago
.
[97]
The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend
Tony Rezko
—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.
[98]
In December 2007,
Money Magazine
estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3
million (equivalent to $1.8
million in 2022).
[99]
Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5
million—up from about $4.2
million in 2007 and $1.6
million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.
[100]
[101]
On his 2010 income of $1.7
million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to
Fisher House Foundation
, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.
[102]
[103]
Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10
million.
[104]
Religious views
Obama is a
Protestant
Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.
[105]
He wrote in
The Audacity of Hope
that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person
... I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for
secular humanism
." He described his father as a "confirmed
atheist
" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with
black churches
as a
community organizer
while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."
[106]
The Obamas worship at
African Methodist Episcopal Church
in Washington, D.C., January 2013
In January 2008, Obama told
Christianity Today
: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the
redemptive death
and
resurrection of Jesus Christ
. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."
[107]
On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying:
I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of
Jesus Christ
spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper,
treating others as they would treat me
.
[108]
[109]
Obama met
Trinity United Church of Christ
pastor
Jeremiah Wright
in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.
[110]
During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after
some of Wright's statements were criticized
.
[111]
Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including
Shiloh Baptist Church
and
St. John's Episcopal Church
, as well as Evergreen Chapel at
Camp David
, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.
[112]
[113]
[114]
In 2016, he said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him "of all the different people I've met along the way", adding: "I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times." The items, "a whole bowl full", include rosary beads given to him by
Pope Francis
, a figurine of the Hindu deity
Hanuman
, a
Coptic cross
from Ethiopia, a small
Buddha statue
given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.
[115]
[116]
Legal career
Civil rights attorney
He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an
associate
for three years from 1993 to 1996, then
of counsel
from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in
Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank
, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This
class action lawsuit
was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act
and the
Fair Housing Act
. The case was settled out of court. Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.

and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee.
[206]
Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.
[207]
He also revoked President

Sonia Sotomayor
on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring
Associate Justice

[214]
On March 11, 2009, Obama created the
White House Council on Women and Girls
, which formed part of the
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs
, having been established by
Executive Order
13506
with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by
Senior Advisor to the President
Valerie Jarrett
. Obama also established the
White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault
through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and
Office of the Vice President of the United States
, and prior to that the 1994
Violence Against Women Act
first drafted by Biden.
In July 2009, Obama launched the
Priority Enforcement Program
, an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W. Bush, and the
Secure Communities
fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.
[215]
In a
major space policy speech
in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at
NASA
, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of
human spaceflight
to the moon and development of the
Ares I
rocket,
Ares V
rocket and
Constellation program
, in favor of funding
earth science
projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the
International Space Station
.
[216]
Obama visits an
Aurora shooting
victim at
University of Colorado Hospital
, 2012.
On January 16, 2013, one month after the
Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting
, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding
gun control
.
[217]
He urged Congress to reintroduce an
expired ban
on military-style
assault weapons
, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
for the first time since 2006.
[218]
On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.
[219]
In a 2016 editorial in
The New York Times
, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed "common-sense gun reform" to
women's suffrage
and other
civil rights movements
in American history. On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.
[219]
In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.
[220]
Following the
2013 global surveillance disclosures
by
whistleblower
Edward Snowden
, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,
[221]
but called for increased restrictions on the
National Security Agency
(NSA) to address violations of privacy.
[222]
[223]
Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms.
[224]
He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
(FISC).
[224]
Racial issues
See also:
Race and ethnicity in the United States
In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,
[225]
[226]
but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.
[227]
Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a "
postracial America
".
[228]
[229]
However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent,
[228]
[230]
and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama.
[231]
The
acquittal
of
George Zimmerman
following the
killing of Trayvon Martin
sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he noted that "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."
[232]
The shooting of
Michael Brown
in
Ferguson, Missouri
sparked a wave of protests
.
[233]
These and other events led to the birth of the
Black Lives Matter
movement, which campaigns against violence and
systemic racism
toward
black people
.
[233]
Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.
[234]
Several incidents during Obama's presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police.
[235]
In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried "a great deal" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.
[236]
LGBT rights and same-sex marriage
On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the
Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act
, a measure that expanded the
1969 United States federal hate-crime law
to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
[237]
On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by
Immigration Equality
.
[238]
On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the
Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010
, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign
[239]
[240]
to end the
don't ask, don't tell
policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the
United States Armed Forces
. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred
transgender people from serving openly in the military
.
[241]
As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing
same-sex marriage
.
[242]
During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.
[243]
In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage."
[244]
On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.
[245]
[246]
During his second
inaugural address
on January 21, 2013,
[201]
Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention
gay rights
or the word "gay" in an inaugural address.
[247]
[248]
In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the
Supreme Court
to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of
Hollingsworth v. Perry
(regarding
same-sex marriage
)
[249]
and
United States v. Windsor
(regarding the
Defense of Marriage Act
).
[250]
Economic policy
Main article:
Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration
On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
, a $787
billion (equivalent to $1074 billion in 2022)
economic stimulus
package aimed at helping the economy recover from the
deepening worldwide recession
.
[251]
The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and
incentives
, and direct assistance to individuals.
[252]
In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary,
Timothy Geithner
, took further steps to manage the
financial crisis
, including introducing the
Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets
, which contains provisions for buying up to $2
trillion in depreciated real estate assets.
[253]
Deficit
and
debt
increases, 2001-2016
Obama intervened in the
troubled automotive industry
[254]
in March 2009, renewing loans for
General Motors
(GM) and
Chrysler
to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the
sale of Chrysler
to Italian automaker
Fiat
[255]
and a
reorganization of GM
giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.
[256]
In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.
[257]
He signed into law the
Car Allowance Rebate System
, known colloquially as "Cash for Clunkers", which temporarily boosted the economy.
[258]
[259]
[260]
The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the
Federal Reserve
and the
Department of the Treasury
. These guarantees totaled about $11.5
trillion, but only $3
trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.
[261]
On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan
Budget Control Act of 2011
. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5
trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2
trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.
[262]
By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a
U.S. government
default
on its obligations.
[263]
The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.
[264]
Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.
[265]
By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent,
[266]
decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013.
[267]
During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter.
[268]
GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
[269]
Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.
[269]
In July 2010, the
Federal Reserve
noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman
Ben Bernanke
said the economic outlook was "unusually uncertain".
[270]
Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.

[273]
Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to other presidents, as measured as a cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term
The
Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.
[274]
[275]
The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1-2.1
million,
[275]
[276]
[277]
while conceding that "it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."
[274]
Although an April 2010, survey of members of the
National Association for Business Economics
showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.
[278]
The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original
NATO
members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of
World War II
.
[279]
The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.
[280]
Within a month of the
2010 midterm elections
, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the
2001 and 2003 income tax rates
, a one-year
payroll tax
reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for
estate taxes
.
[281]
The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858
billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2022)
Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010
passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.
[282]
In December 2013, Obama declared that growing
income inequality
is a "defining challenge of our time" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the
nationwide strikes of fast-food workers
and
Pope Francis
' criticism of inequality and
trickle-down economics
.
[283]
Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the
Trans-Pacific Partnership
.

Obama at a 2010 briefing on the
BP oil spill
at the
Coast Guard
Station Venice in
Venice, Louisiana
On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore
drilling rig
at the
Macondo Prospect
in the
Gulf of Mexico
, causing a
major sustained oil leak
. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by
Secretary of the Interior
Ken Salazar
and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new
deepwater drilling
permits and leases, pending regulatory review.
[285]
As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.
[286]
Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the
East Coast of the United States
and along the coast of
northern Alaska
in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.
[287]
In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he "would reject the
Keystone XL pipeline
if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions."
[288]
[289]
On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.
[290]
It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.
[291]
In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the
Atlantic
and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.
[292]
[293]
[294]
Obama emphasized the
conservation
of
federal lands
during his term in office. He used his power under the
Antiquities Act
to create 25 new
national monuments
during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.
[295]
[296]
[297]
Health care reform
Main article:
Healthcare reform in the United States
Obama called for
Congress
to pass legislation reforming
health care in the United States
, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.
[298]
He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900
billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the
public option
, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for
pre-existing conditions
, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.

On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.
[298]
After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered
a speech to a joint session of Congress
on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.
[302]
In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.
[303]
On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.
[304]
[305]
On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60-39.
[306]
On March 21, 2010, the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA, colloquially "Obamacare") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.
[307]
The ACA includes
health-related provisions
, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding
Medicaid
eligibility for people making up to 133 percent
of the
federal poverty level
(FPL) starting in 2014,
[308]
subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent
of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income,
[309]
providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing
health insurance exchanges

The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income
brackets
, taxes on
indoor tanning
, cuts to the
Medicare Advantage
program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;
[312]
there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.
[313]
In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143
billion over the first decade.
[314]
The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 vote in
National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius
that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.
[315]
In
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby
the Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act
from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6-3 in
King v. Burwell
that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State", as the statute reads.

[331]
The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to

In his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a "dangerous distraction" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan,
[343]
the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again.
[344]
Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to "stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan", an area he said had not received the "strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires."
[345]
He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General
David D. McKiernan
, with former
Special Forces
commander Lt. Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal
in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.
[346]
On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;
[347]
this took place in July 2011.
David Petraeus
replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.
[348]
In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.
[349]
In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.
[350]
Regarding neighboring
Pakistan
, Obama called its tribal border region the "greatest threat" to the security of Afghanistan and Americans, saying that he "cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary." In the same speech, Obama claimed that the U.S. "cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy."

Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of
Osama bin Laden
. He was living in seclusion in
a large compound
in
Abbottabad
, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from
Islamabad
.
[352]
CIA head
Leon Panetta
reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.

Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by
United States Navy SEALs
.
[352]
The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.
[353]
[354]
DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,
[355]
which was buried at sea several hours later.
[356]

based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.
[372]
In 2013,
Jeffrey Goldberg
reported that, in Obama's view, "with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation."
[373]
In 2014, Obama likened the
Zionist movement
to the
civil rights movement
in the United States.

[374]
Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the
2014 Israel-Gaza conflict

United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334
, which condemned
Israeli settlement
building in the occupied
Palestinian territories
as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.
[377]

Muammar Gaddafi
as part of the
Arab Spring
. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the
Arab League
, and a resolution
[384]
passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973
on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to "show no mercy" to the rebels of
Benghazi
[386]
—announced an immediate cessation of military activities.

[388]
including the use of
Tomahawk missiles
,

chemical weapons attack
in Syria,
formally blamed
by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the "red line" he had pledged
[403]

In November 2013, the Obama administration opened
negotiations
with Iran to prevent it from acquiring
nuclear weapons
, which included an
interim agreement
. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
.
[407]
[408]
[409]
In addition, the transfer of $1.7
billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the "effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions."
[410]
In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded
Hezbollah
from the
Drug Enforcement Administration
's
Project Cassandra
investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the
Central Intelligence Agency

In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle's official White House portraits.
[485]
Around the same time, he won a
Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator
[486]
for his narration in the Netflix documentary series
Our Great National Parks
.
[487]
In 2022, Obama opposed expanding the Supreme Court beyond the present nine Justices.
[488]
In March 2023, Obama traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, Obama met with Australian Prime Minister
Anthony Albanese
and visited
Melbourne
for the first time.
[489]
Obama was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.
[490]
[491]
In October 2023, during the
Israel-Hamas war
, Obama warned
Israel
that its actions could "harden Palestinian attitudes for generations" and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war's human costs "could ultimately backfire."
[492]
Legacy
Historian
Julian Zelizer
credits Obama with "a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals." Zelizer notes Obama's policy successes included the
economic stimulus package
which ended the
Great Recession
and the
Dodd-Frank
financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the
Affordable Care Act
. Zelizer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama "turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder." Zelizer calls this the "defining paradox of Obama's presidency".
[493]
The
Brookings Institution
noted that Obama passed "only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions."
[494]
David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short "in areas many Progressives hold dear", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama's legacy that of "a disappointingly conventional president".
[495]
Obama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the
Affordable Care Act
(ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a "skinny repeal", have thus far failed.
[496]
However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.
[497]
Together with the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
amendment, it represents the
U.S. healthcare system
's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of
Medicare
and
Medicaid
in 1965.
[498]
[499]
[500]
[501]
Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened
depression
and pulling the economy back from the
Great Recession
.
[496]
According to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
, the
Obama administration
created 11.3 million jobs from the month after
his first inauguration
to the end of his second term.
[502]
In 2010, Obama signed into effect the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
. Passed as a response to the
financial crisis of 2007-2008
, it brought the most significant changes to
financial regulation
in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the
Great Depression
under Democratic President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
.
[503]
In 2009, Obama signed into law the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010
, which contained in it the
Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act
, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President
Bill Clinton
signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded
existing federal hate crime laws in the United States
, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
[504]
As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.
[505]
In 2010, he signed the
Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act
, which brought an end to "
don't ask, don't tell
" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from
LGB
people; the law went into effect the following year.
[506]
In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on
transgender
people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.
[507]
[241]
A
Gallup poll
, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.
[508]
Obama substantially escalated the use of
drone strikes
against suspected militants and terrorists associated with
al-Qaeda
and the
Taliban
.
[509]
In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.
[510]
[511]
Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in
Afghanistan
, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.
[512]
According to
Pew Research Center
and
United States Bureau of Justice Statistics
, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President
Jimmy Carter
. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents
Ronald Reagan
,
George H. W. Bush
,
Bill Clinton
, and
George W. Bush
.
[513]
Human Rights Watch
(HRW) called Obama's human rights record "mixed", adding that "he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest—nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed."
[224]
Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.
[514]
[515]
He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the
Brookings Institution
that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.
[516]
In Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.

Nazi Germany
,
[h]
officially known as the
German Reich
[i]
until 1943, later the
Greater German Reich
,
[j]
was the
German state
between 1933 and 1945, when
Adolf Hitler
and the
Nazi Party
controlled the country, transforming it into a
totalitarian dictatorship
.
Under Hitler's rule, Germany quickly became a
totalitarian
state where many aspects of life were controlled by the government. The
Third Reich
,
[k]
meaning "Third Realm" or "Third Empire", referred to the Nazi claim that Nazi Germany was the successor to the earlier
Holy Roman Empire
(800-1806) and
German Empire
(1871-1918). The Third Reich, which the Nazis referred to as the
Thousand-Year Reich
,
[l]
ended in May 1945, after only 12 years, when the
Allies
defeated Germany and entered the capital,
Berlin
,
ending World War II in Europe
.
The Nazi Party became the largest in parliament following the
July 1932 German federal election
, but it did not hold a majority. Hitler refused to participate in a coalition government unless he was its leader. By the constitution of the
Weimar Republic
, in those circumstances the
chancellor of Germany
(the
head of government
) could be appointed by the
president
,
Paul von Hindenburg
, who appointed Hitler on 30 January 1933, at the behest of right-wing politicians and industrialists. The
Reichstag fire
was used to pass the
Reichstag Fire Decree
, leading to the suppression of civil liberties and mass arrests of political opponents. The
Enabling Act of 1933
gave
Hitler's government
the power to make and enforce laws without the
Reichstag
(parliament) or president. The Nazis began to eliminate political opposition and consolidate power. Hindenburg died in August 1934, and Hitler became dictator by merging the powers of the chancellery and presidency. A
1934 German referendum
confirmed Hitler as sole
Führer
(leader). Power was centralised in Hitler's person, his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the
Great Depression
, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment, using heavy military spending. Financed by
deficit spending
, the regime undertook extensive public works projects, including the
Autobahnen
(motorways) and a massive
secret rearmament program
, forming the
Wehrmacht
(armed forces). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.
Racism
,
Nazi eugenics
,
anti-Slavism
, and especially
antisemitism
were central ideological features of the regime. The
Germanic peoples
were considered by the Nazis to be the "
master race
", the purest branch of the Aryan race. Discrimination and persecution of
Jews
and
Romani people
accelerated. The first
concentration camps
were established in March 1933. Jews,
liberals
,
socialists
,
communists
, other political opponents and undesirables were imprisoned, exiled, or murdered. Christian churches and citizens that
opposed Hitler's rule
were oppressed and leaders imprisoned. Education focused on
racial biology
, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women
were curtailed
. The
1936 Summer Olympics
showcased Germany on the international stage.
Propaganda Minister
Joseph Goebbels
made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.
From the latter half of the 1930s, Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. The
Saarland
voted
to rejoin Germany in 1935, and in 1936 Hitler sent troops into the
Rhineland
, which had been demilitarised after
World War I
. Germany seized
Austria
in the
Anschluss
of 1938, and demanded and received the
Sudetenland
region of Czechoslovakia in that same year. In March 1939, the
Slovak state
was proclaimed and became a
client state
and the German
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
was established on the remainder of occupied
Czech lands
. Germany signed
a non-aggression pact
with the
Soviet Union
and
invaded Poland
on 1 September 1939, launching
World War II in Europe
. By late 1942, Germany and its European allies in the
Axis powers
controlled much of Europe and
North Africa
. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of its occupied territories and allies.
Genocide
,
mass murder
, and
large-scale forced labour
became hallmarks of the regime.
Generalplan Ost
was implemented to exterminate the
Slavic
populations of
Eastern Europe
and advance the
Lebensraum
settler-colonial
programme. Hundreds of thousands with mental or physical disabilities were
murdered in hospitals and asylums
.
Einsatzgruppen
paramilitary
death squads
accompanied the armed forces inside the occupied territories and conducted genocide of millions of Jews and other
Holocaust victims
. Millions were imprisoned,
worked to death
, or murdered in
Nazi concentration camps
and
extermination camps
. This genocide is known as
the Holocaust
.
While the
German invasion
of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the US into the war meant Germany lost the initiative in 1943, and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the 1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated and the Axis powers were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the
Allied invasion of France
, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the
other Allies
from the west, and
capitulated
on 8 May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The Allies initiated a policy of
denazification
and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the
Nuremberg trials
.
Name
Common English terms for the German state in the Nazi era are "Nazi Germany" and the "Third Reich", which Hitler and the Nazis also referred to as the "Thousand-Year Reich" (
Tausendjähriges Reich
).
[4]
The latter, a translation of the Nazi propaganda term
Drittes Reich
, was first used in
Das Dritte Reich
, a 1923 book by
Arthur Moeller van den Bruck
.
[5]
The book counted the
Holy Roman Empire
(962-1806) as the first
Reich
and the
German Empire
(1871-1918) as the second.
[6]
The name "Third Reich" was widespread even contemporarily, both within and outside of Germany. However, the term was never official, with the German state's official title remaining
Deutsches Reich
as per the
Weimar Constitution
until it became
Großdeutsches Reich
following the
Anschluss
of
Austria
. While the term "Third Reich" was used as a description for Germany during the time of National Socialism, it has today become a term to describe the historical era from 1933 to 1945.
[7]
Brought into the Nazi jargon by
Otto Strasser
and
Joseph Goebbels
in the mid-1920s, the term was used to simultaneously provide an ideological bridge to the past and offer an alternative to the democratic Weimar system.
[8]
While the term was prominently used by the Nazi Party early in the regime's time in power, by the late 1930s, it fell out of favour. On 13 June 1939, a circular was sent to all party offices stating that Hitler did not wish for the term "Third Reich" to be used. A similar directive was issued by the Propaganda Ministry on 10 July 1939.
[9]
Author Hermann Butzer states that the reasons for this turn appear to have been twofold: on the one hand, the Nazis wanted to underline the unique role Hitler played in bringing the party to power, therefore using Moeller van den Bruck's term seemed inappropriate. On the other hand, the intention was to portray National Socialist Germany as something historically novel; therefore the connection to the past was considered inconvenient.
[10]
Background
Further information:
Adolf Hitler's rise to power
Germany was known as the
Weimar Republic
during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a
parliamentary democracy
with a
semi-presidential system
. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including
hyperinflation
, political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the
Allied victors
of World War I, and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.
[11]
Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of
reparations payments
required under the 1919
Treaty of Versailles
. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.
[12]
When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops
occupied German industrial areas
along the
Ruhr
and widespread civil unrest followed.
[13]
The
National Socialist German Workers' Party
(
Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei
), commonly known as the Nazi Party, was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the
German Workers' Party
(DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several
far-right
political parties then active in Germany.
[14]
The
Nazi Party platform
included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical
antisemitism
, and anti-
Bolshevism
.
[15]
They promised a strong central government, increased
Lebensraum
("living space") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of
Jews
, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.
[16]
The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the
Völkisch
movement
.
[17]
The party, especially its paramilitary organisation
Sturmabteilung
(SA; Storm Detachment), or Brownshirts, used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members as well as Jewish people on the streets.
[18]
Such far-right armed groups were common in
Bavaria
, and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of
Gustav Ritter von Kahr
.
[19]
When the stock market in the United States
crashed on 24 October 1929
, the effect in Germany was dire.
[20]
Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazis prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.
[21]
Many voters decided the Nazi Party was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the
federal election of 1932
, the party was the largest in the
Reichstag
, holding 230 seats with 37.4 per cent of the popular vote.
[22]
History
Further information:
History of Germany
Adolf Hitler
became Germany's head of state, with the title of
Führer und Reichskanzler
, in 1934.
Nazi seizure of power
Main article:
Adolf Hitler's rise to power § Seizure of control (1931-1933)
Although the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler refused to participate in a coalition government unless he was its leader.
[23]
Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President
Paul von Hindenburg
appointed Hitler as
Chancellor of Germany
on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the
Machtergreifung
("seizure of power").
[24]
On the night of 27 February 1933, the
Reichstag building was set afire
.
Marinus van der Lubbe
, a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The
Reichstag Fire Decree
, imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the
Communist Party of Germany
were arrested.
[25]
On 23 March 1933, the
Enabling Act
, an amendment to the
Weimar Constitution
, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.
[26]
This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.
[27]
As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several
Social Democratic
deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned.
[28]
[29]
The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the Nazis established.
[30]
On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June.
[31]
On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party - their former coalition partners - which then disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a
one-party state
with the passage of the
Law Against the Formation of Parties
, decreeing the Nazi Party to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned.
[32]
Further elections
in November 1933
,
1936
, and
1938
were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the Party and a small number of independents elected.
[33]
Nazification of Germany
Main article:
Gleichschaltung
While the
traditional German states
were not formally abolished (excluding
Lübeck
in 1937
), their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended. Prussia
was already under federal administration
when Hitler came to power, providing a model for the process.
The
Hitler cabinet
used the terms of the Reichstag Fire Decree and later the Enabling Act to initiate the process of
Gleichschaltung
("co-ordination"), which brought all aspects of life under party control.
[34]
Individual states not controlled by elected Nazi governments or Nazi-led coalitions were forced to agree to the appointment of Reich Commissars to bring the states in line with the policies of the central government. These Commissars, later replaced by
Reichsstatthaltern
(Reich Governors), had the power to dissolve state parliaments and to appoint and remove local governments, officials, and judges. In this way Germany became a
de facto
unitary state
, with all state governments controlled by the central government under the Nazis.
[35]
[36]
All the state parliaments were abolished on 30 January 1934 by the
Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich
, with all state sovereignty being transferred to the central government.
[36]
[37]
The
Reichsrat
(federal upper house) soon followed on 14 February 1934 with the
Law on the Abolition of the Reichsrat
.
[38]
All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members; these civic organisations either merged with the Nazi Party or faced dissolution.
[39]
The Nazi government declared a "Day of National Labor" for
May Day
1933, and invited many trade union delegates to Berlin for celebrations. The day after, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country; all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested.
[40]
The
Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service
, passed in April, removed from their jobs all teachers, professors, judges, magistrates, and government officials who were Jewish or whose commitment to the party was suspect.
[41]
This meant the only non-political institutions not under control of the Nazis were the churches.
[42]
The Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic—including the
black, red, and gold tricolour flag
—and adopted reworked symbolism. The previous imperial black, white, and red tricolour was restored as one of Germany's two official flags; the second was the
swastika flag
of the Nazi Party, which became the sole national flag in September 1935. The Party anthem "
Horst-Wessel-Lied
" ("Horst Wessel Song") became a second national anthem.
[43]
Germany was still in a dire economic situation, as six million people were unemployed and the
balance of trade
deficit was daunting.
[44]
Using
deficit spending
, public works projects were undertaken beginning in 1934, creating 1.7 million new jobs by the end of that year alone.
[44]
Average wages began to rise.
[45]
Consolidation of power
The SA leadership continued to apply pressure for greater political and military power. In response, Hitler used the
Schutzstaffel
(SS) and
Gestapo
to purge the entire SA leadership.
[46]
Hitler targeted SA
Stabschef
(Chief of Staff)
Ernst Röhm
and other SA leaders who—along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as
Gregor Strasser
and former chancellor
Kurt von Schleicher
)—were arrested and shot.
[47]
Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the
Night of the Long Knives
.
[48]
On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died. The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the "
Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich
", which stated that upon Hindenburg's death the office of Reich President would be abolished and its powers merged with those of Reich Chancellor.
[49]
Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as
Führer und Reichskanzler
("Leader and Chancellor"), although eventually
Reichskanzler
was dropped.
[50]
Germany was now a totalitarian state with Hitler at its head.
[51]
As head of state, Hitler became Supreme Commander of the armed forces. The new law provided an altered loyalty oath for servicemen so that they
affirmed loyalty to Hitler personally
rather than the office of supreme commander or the state.
[52]
On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 per cent of the electorate in a
plebiscite
.
[53]
Joseph Goebbels
, Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda
Most Germans were relieved that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda
Joseph Goebbels
, who promised peace and plenty for all in a united, Marxist-free country without the constraints of the Versailles Treaty.
[54]
The Nazi Party obtained and legitimised power through its initial revolutionary activities, then through manipulation of legal mechanisms, the use of police powers, and by taking control of the state and federal institutions.
[55]
[56]
The first major
Nazi concentration camp
, initially for political prisoners, was opened at
Dachau
in 1933.
[57]
Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created by the end of the war.
[58]
Beginning in April 1933, scores of measures defining the status of Jews and their rights were instituted.
[59]
These measures culminated in the establishment of the
Nuremberg Laws
of 1935, which stripped them of their basic rights.
[60]
The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews, and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as law, medicine, or education). Eventually the Nazis declared the Jews as undesirable to remain among German citizens and society.
[61]
Military build-up
See also:
International relations (1919-1939)
,
Remilitarization of the Rhineland
, and
German involvement in the Spanish Civil War
In the early years of the regime, Germany was without allies, and its military was drastically weakened by the Versailles Treaty. France, Poland, Italy, and the
Soviet Union
each had reasons to object to Hitler's rise to power. Poland suggested to France that the two nations engage in a
preventive war
against Germany in March 1933.
Fascist Italy
objected to German claims in the
Balkans
and on
Austria
, which
Benito Mussolini
considered to be in Italy's sphere of influence.
[62]
As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must begin, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. On 17 May 1933, Hitler gave a speech before the Reichstag outlining his desire for
world peace
and accepted an offer from American President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
for military disarmament, provided the other nations of Europe did the same.
[63]
When the other European powers failed to accept this offer, Hitler pulled Germany out of the
World Disarmament Conference
and the
League of Nations
in October, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair if they applied only to Germany.
[64]
In
a referendum held in November
, 95 per cent of voters supported Germany's withdrawal.
[65]
In 1934, Hitler told his military leaders that a war in the east should begin in 1942.
[66]
The
Saarland
, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany.
[67]
In March 1935, Hitler announced the creation of an air force, and that the
Reichswehr
would be increased to 550,000 men.
[68]
Britain agreed to Germany building a naval fleet with the signing of the
Anglo-German Naval Agreement
on 18 June 1935.
[69]
When the Italian
invasion of Ethiopia
led to only mild protests by the British and French governments, on 7 March 1936 Hitler used the
Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance
as a pretext to order the army to march 3,000 troops into the demilitarised zone in the
Rhineland
in violation of the Versailles Treaty.
[70]
As the territory was part of Germany, the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war.
[71]
In the one-party election held on 29 March, the Nazis received 98.9 per cent support.
[71]
In 1936, Hitler signed an
Anti-Comintern Pact
with Japan and a non-aggression agreement with Mussolini, who was soon referring to a "Rome-Berlin Axis".
[72]
Hitler sent military supplies and assistance to the Nationalist forces of General
Francisco Franco
in the
Spanish Civil War
, which began in July 1936. The German
Condor Legion
included a range of aircraft and their crews, as well as a tank contingent. The aircraft of the Legion
destroyed the city of Guernica
in 1937.
[73]
The Nationalists were victorious in 1939 and became an informal ally of Nazi Germany.
[74]

In February 1938, Hitler emphasised to Austrian Chancellor
Kurt Schuschnigg
the need for Germany to secure its frontiers. Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding Austrian independence for 13 March, but Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian Nazi Party or face an invasion. German troops entered Austria the next day, to be greeted with enthusiasm by the populace.
[75]
The
Republic of Czechoslovakia
was home to a substantial minority of Germans, who lived mostly in the
Sudetenland
. Under pressure from separatist groups within the
Sudeten German Party
, the Czechoslovak government offered economic concessions to the region.
[76]
Hitler decided not just to incorporate the Sudetenland into the Reich, but to destroy the country of Czechoslovakia entirely.
[77]
The Nazis undertook a propaganda campaign to try to generate support for an invasion.
[78]
Top German military leaders opposed the plan, as Germany was not yet ready for war.
[79]
The crisis led to war preparations by Britain, Czechoslovakia, and France (Czechoslovakia's ally). Attempting to avoid war, British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain
arranged a series of meetings, the result of which was the
Munich Agreement
, signed on 29 September 1938. The Czechoslovak government was forced to accept the Sudetenland's annexation into Germany. Chamberlain was greeted with cheers when he landed in London, saying the agreement brought "peace for our time".
[80]
In addition to the German annexation,
Poland
seized a narrow strip of land near
Cieszyn
on 2 October, while as a consequence of the Munich Agreement,
Hungary
demanded and received 12,000 km
2
(4,600 sq mi) along their northern border in the
First Vienna Award
on 2 November.
[81]
Following negotiations with President
Emil Hácha
, Hitler seized the rest of the Czech half of the country on 15 March 1939 and created the
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
, one day after the proclamation of the
Slovak Republic
in the Slovak half.
[82]
Also on 15 March, Hungary occupied and annexed the recently proclaimed and unrecognised
Carpatho-Ukraine
and
an additional sliver of land disputed with Slovakia
.
[83]
[84]
Austrian and Czech foreign exchange reserves were seized by the Nazis, as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped to Germany. The
Reichswerke Hermann Göring
industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.
[85]
Poland
A

In January 1934, Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Poland.
[86]
In March 1939, Hitler demanded the return of the
Free City of Danzig
and the
Polish Corridor
, a strip of land that separated
East Prussia
from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would come to the aid of Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for September 1939.
[87]
On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland. He expected this time they would be met by force.
[88]
The Germans reaffirmed their alliance with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia, and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway, and Sweden.
[89]
Foreign Minister
Joachim von Ribbentrop
arranged in negotiations with the Soviet Union a non-aggression pact, the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
, signed in August 1939.
[90]
The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states into German and Soviet spheres of influence.

Foreign policy
Further information:
Diplomatic history of World War II § Germany
Germany's wartime foreign policy involved the creation of allied governments controlled directly or indirectly from Berlin. They intended to obtain soldiers from allies such as Italy and Hungary and workers and food supplies from allies such as
Vichy France
.
[92]
Hungary was the fourth nation to join the Axis, signing the
Tripartite Pact
on 27 September 1940. Bulgaria signed the pact on 17 November. German efforts to secure oil included negotiating a supply from their new ally,
Romania
, who signed the Pact on 23 November, alongside the Slovak Republic.
[93]
[94]
[95]
By late 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy, and 10 from Hungary.
[96]
Germany assumed full control in France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was a powerful ally, the relationship was distant, with little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.
[97]
Outbreak of war
Germany invaded Poland
and captured the Free City of Danzig on 1 September 1939, beginning World War II in Europe.
[98]
Honouring their treaty obligations, Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later.
[99]
Poland fell quickly, as the Soviet Union attacked from the east on 17 September.
[100]
Reinhard Heydrich
, chief of the
Sicherheitspolizei
(SiPo; Security Police) and
Sicherheitsdienst
(SD; Security Service), ordered on 21 September that Polish Jews should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport them further east, or possibly to
Madagascar
.
[101]
Using
lists prepared in advance
, some 65,000 Polish intelligentsia, noblemen, clergy, and teachers were murdered by the end of 1939 in an attempt to destroy Poland's identity as a nation.
[102]
[103]
Soviet forces advanced into Finland in the
Winter War
, and German forces saw action at sea. But little other activity occurred until May, so the period became known as the "
Phoney War
".
[104]
From the start of the war, a
British blockade
on shipments to Germany affected its economy. Germany was particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal, and grain.
[105]
Thanks to trade embargoes and the blockade, imports into Germany declined by 80 per cent.
[106]
To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered the
invasion of Denmark and Norway
, which began on 9 April.
Denmark fell after less than a day
, while
most of Norway followed
by the end of the month.
[107]
[108]
By early June, Germany
occupied all of Norway
.
[109]
Conquest of Europe
Against the advice of many of his senior military officers, in May 1940 Hitler ordered an
attack on France
and the
Low Countries
.
[110]
[111]
They quickly conquered
Luxembourg
and the
Netherlands
and outmanoeuvred the Allies in
Belgium
,
forcing the evacuation
of many British and French troops at
Dunkirk
.
[112]
France fell as well,
surrendering to Germany on 22 June
.
[113]
The victory in France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and an upsurge in war fever in Germany.
[114]
In violation of the provisions of the
Hague Convention
, industrial firms in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium were put to work producing war
materiel
for Germany.
[115]
German soldiers march near the
Arc de Triomphe
in Paris, 14 June 1940.
The Nazis seized from the French thousands of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles of weapons, and raw materials such as copper, tin, oil, and nickel.
[116]
Payments for occupation costs were levied upon France, Belgium, and Norway.
[117]
Barriers to trade led to hoarding,
black markets
, and uncertainty about the future.
[118]
Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most of Europe.
[119]
Famine was experienced in many occupied countries.
[119]
Hitler's peace overtures to the new British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
were rejected in July 1940. Grand Admiral
Erich Raeder
had advised Hitler in June that air superiority was a pre-condition for a successful
invasion of Britain
, so Hitler ordered a series of aerial attacks on
Royal Air Force
(RAF) airbases and radar stations, as well as
nightly air raids
on British cities, including
London
,
Plymouth
, and
Coventry
. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the RAF in what became known as the
Battle of Britain
, and by the end of October, Hitler realised that air superiority would not be achieved. He permanently postponed the invasion, a plan which the commanders of the German army had never taken entirely seriously.
[120]
[121]
[m]
Several historians, including
Andrew Gordon
, believe the primary reason for the failure of the invasion plan was the superiority of the Royal Navy, not the actions of the RAF.
[122]
In February 1941, the German
Afrika Korps
arrived in
Libya
to aid the Italians in the
North African Campaign
.
[123]
On 6 April, Germany launched an
invasion of Yugoslavia
and
Greece
.
[124]
[125]
All of Yugoslavia and parts of Greece were subsequently divided between Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Bulgaria.
[126]
[127]
Invasion of the Soviet Union
Main article:
Operation Barbarossa
On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, about 3.8 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.
[128]
In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring
Lebensraum
, this large-scale offensive—codenamed
Operation Barbarossa
—was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.
[129]
The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would continue or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.
[130]
Death and destruction during the
Battle of Stalingrad
, October 1942
The invasion conquered a huge area, including the
Baltic
states,
Belarus
, and west
Ukraine
. After the successful
Battle of Smolensk
in September 1941, Hitler ordered
Army Group Centre
to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of
Leningrad
and
Kyiv
.
[131]
This pause provided the
Red Army
with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941,
ended disastrously in December
.
[132]
On 7 December 1941, Japan
attacked Pearl Harbor
, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.
[133]
Food was in short supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, as the retreating armies had burned the crops in some areas, and much of the remainder was sent back to the Reich.
[134]
In Germany, rations were cut in 1942. In his role as
Plenipotentiary
of the
Four Year Plan
,
Hermann Göring
demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was good, and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.
[135]
Germany and Europe as a whole were almost totally dependent on foreign oil imports.
[136]
In an attempt to resolve the shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched
Fall Blau
("Case Blue"), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields.
[137]
The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in
Stalingrad
on 23 November.
[138]
Göring assured Hitler that the
6th Army
could be supplied by air, but this turned out to be infeasible.
[139]
Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war.
[140]
Turning point and collapse
See also:
Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany
,
Flensburg Government
, and
German Instrument of Surrender
Losses continued to mount after Stalingrad, leading to a sharp reduction in the popularity of the Nazi Party and deteriorating morale.
[141]
Soviet forces continued to push westward after the failed German offensive at the
Battle of Kursk
in the summer of 1943. By the end of 1943, the Germans had lost most of their eastern territorial gains.
[142]
In Egypt, Field Marshal
Erwin Rommel
's
Afrika Korps
were defeated by British forces under Field Marshal
Bernard Montgomery
in October 1942.
[143]
The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September.
[144]
Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began
operations against Germany
. Many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets in an effort to destroy German morale.
[145]
The bombing of aircraft factories as well as
Peenemünde Army Research Center
, where
V-1
and
V-2
rockets were being developed and produced, were also deemed particularly important.
[146]
[147]
German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses, and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.
[148]
On 6 June 1944, American, British, and Canadian forces established a front in France with the
D-Day
landings in
Normandy
.
[149]
On
20 July 1944
, Hitler survived an assassination attempt.
[150]
He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000 arrests and the execution of more than 4,900 people.
[151]
The failed
Ardennes Offensive
(16 December 1944 - 25 January 1945) was the last major German offensive on the western front, and Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January.
[152]
Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the war's closing months.
[153]
Through his Justice Minister
Otto Georg Thierack
, Hitler ordered that anyone who was not prepared to fight should be court-martialed, and thousands of people were executed.
[154]
In many areas, people surrendered to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue to fight. Hitler ordered the destruction of transport, bridges, industries, and other infrastructure—a
scorched earth
decree—but Armaments Minister
Albert Speer
prevented this order from being fully carried out.
[153]
U.S. Army Air Force
film of the destruction in central Berlin in July 1945
During the
Battle of Berlin
(16 April 1945 - 2 May 1945), Hitler and his staff lived in the underground
Führerbunker
while the Red Army approached.
[155]
On 30 April, when Soviet troops were within two blocks of the
Reich Chancellery
, Hitler, along with his girlfriend and by then wife
Eva Braun
committed suicide
.
[156]
On 2 May, General
Helmuth Weidling
unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General
Vasily Chuikov
.
[157]
Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral
Karl Dönitz
as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor.
[158]
Goebbels and his wife
Magda
committed suicide the next day after murdering their
six children
.
[159]
Between 4 and 8 May 1945, most of the remaining German armed forces unconditionally surrendered. The
German Instrument of Surrender
was signed 8 May, marking the end of the Nazi regime and the
end of World War II in Europe
.
[160]
Popular support for Hitler almost completely disappeared as the war drew to a close.
[161]
Suicide rates in Germany increased, particularly in areas where the Red Army was advancing. Among soldiers and party personnel, suicide was often deemed an honourable and heroic alternative to surrender. First-hand accounts and propaganda about the uncivilised behaviour of the advancing Soviet troops caused panic among civilians on the Eastern Front, especially women, who feared being raped.
[162]
More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000)
committed suicide in Demmin
on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of
2nd Belorussian Front
first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians, and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including
Neubrandenburg
(600 dead),
Stolp in Pommern
(1,000 dead),
[163]
and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.
[164]

Estimates of the total German war dead range from 5.5 to 6.9 million persons.
[165]
A study by German historian
Rüdiger Overmans
puts the number of German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders.
[166]
Richard Overy
estimated in 2014 that about 353,000 civilians were killed in Allied air raids.
[167]
Other civilian deaths include 300,000 Germans (including Jews) who were victims of Nazi political, racial, and religious persecution
[168]
and 200,000 who were murdered in the
Nazi euthanasia program
.
[169]
Political courts called
Sondergerichte
sentenced some 12,000 members of the
German resistance
to death, and civil courts sentenced an additional 40,000 Germans.
[170]
Mass rapes of German women
also took place.

.
[172]
Germany regained control of the Saarland through a referendum held in 1935 and annexed Austria in the

of 1938.
[173]
The Munich Agreement of 1938 gave Germany control of the Sudetenland, and they seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia six months later.

), German-occupied Poland, 1942
Some of the conquered territories were incorporated into Germany as part of Hitler's long-term goal of creating a
Greater Germanic Reich
. Several areas, such as Alsace-Lorraine, were placed under the authority of an adjacent
Gau
(regional district). The
Reichskommissariate
(Reich Commissariats), quasi-colonial regimes, were established in some occupied countries. Areas placed under German administration included the
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
,
Reichskommissariat Ostland
(encompassing the Baltic states and Belarus), and
Reichskommissariat Ukraine
. Conquered areas of Belgium and France were placed under control of the
Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France
.
[176]
Belgian
Eupen-Malmedy
, which had been part of Germany until 1919, was annexed. Part of Poland was incorporated into the Reich, and the
General Government
was established in occupied central Poland.
[177]
The governments of Denmark, Norway (
Reichskommissariat Norwegen
), and the Netherlands (
Reichskommissariat Niederlande
) were placed under civilian administrations staffed largely by natives.
[176]
[n]
Hitler intended to eventually incorporate many of these areas into the Reich.

Germany occupied the
Italian protectorate of Albania

Ideology
Main article:
Nazism
The Nazis were a far-right
fascist
political party which arose during the social and financial upheavals that occurred following the end of World War I.
[181]
The Party remained small and marginalised, receiving 2.6% of the federal vote in 1928, prior to the onset of the Great Depression in 1929.
[182]
By 1930 the Party won 18.3% of the federal vote, making it the Reichstag's second largest political party.
[183]
While in prison after the failed
Beer Hall Putsch
of 1923, Hitler wrote
Mein Kampf
, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race.
[184]
Nazi ideology brought together elements of antisemitism,
racial hygiene
, and
eugenics
, and combined them with
pan-Germanism
and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more
Lebensraum
for the Germanic people.
[185]
The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or murder the Jews and
Slavs
living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan
master race
and part of a
Jewish-Bolshevik
conspiracy.
[186]
[187]
The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by
International Jewry
.
[188]
Other people deemed
life unworthy of life
by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled,
Romani people
,
homosexuals
,
Jehovah's Witnesses
, and social misfits.
[189]
[190]
Additionally,
Freemasons
were
heavily monitored and persecuted
.
[191]
Influenced by the
Völkisch
movement
, the regime was against cultural
modernism
and supported the development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism.
[17]
[192]
Creativity and art were stifled, except where they could serve as propaganda media.
[193]
The party used symbols such as the
Blood Flag
and rituals such as the
Nazi Party rallies
to foster unity and bolster the regime's popularity.
[194]
Government
Main article:
Government of Nazi Germany
Hitler, Göring, Goebbels and
Rudolf Hess
during a military parade in 1933
Hitler ruled Germany autocratically by asserting the
Führerprinzip
("leader principle"), which called for absolute obedience by all subordinates. He viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Party rank was not determined by elections, and positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank.
[195]
The party used propaganda to develop a
cult of personality
around Hitler.
[196]
Historians such as Kershaw emphasise the psychological impact of Hitler's skill as an orator.
[197]
Roger Gill states: "His moving speeches captured the minds and hearts of a vast number of the German people: he virtually hypnotized his audiences".
[198]
While top officials reported to Hitler and followed his policies, they had considerable autonomy.
[199]
He expected officials to "work towards the Führer" - to take the initiative in promoting policies and actions in line with party goals and Hitler's wishes, without his involvement in day-to-day decision-making.
[200]
The government was a disorganised collection of factions led by the party elite, who struggled to amass power and gain the Führer's favour.
[201]
Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them in positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.
[202]
In this way he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.
[203]
Successive
Reichsstatthalter
decrees between 1933 and 1935 abolished the existing
Länder
(
constituent states
) of Germany and replaced them with new
administrative divisions
, the
Gaue
, governed by Nazi leaders (
Gauleiters
).
[204]
The change was never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.
[205]
Jewish civil servants lost their jobs in 1933, except for those who had seen military service in World War I. Members of the Party or party supporters were appointed in their place.
[206]
As part of the process of
Gleichschaltung
, the Reich Local Government Law of 1935 abolished local elections, and mayors were appointed by the Ministry of the Interior.
[207]
Law
Main article:
Law in Nazi Germany
Chart showing the
pseudo-scientific
racial divisions used in the racial policies of Nazi Germany
In August 1934, civil servants and members of the military were required to swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler. These laws became the basis of the
Führerprinzip
, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws.
[208]
Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal.
[209]
All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of
Deputy Führer
Rudolf Hess
, who could also veto top civil service appointments.
[210]
Most of the judicial system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in place to deal with non-political crimes.
[211]
The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power.
[211]
People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely.
[212]
People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.
[213]
A meeting of the four jurists who imposed Nazi ideology on the legal system of Germany (left to right:

,

)
A new type of court, the
Volksgerichtshof
("People's Court"), was established in 1934 to deal with political cases.
[214]
This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945.
[215]
The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets, or even making jokes about Hitler or other officials.
[216]
The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce Nazi ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews, and others deemed undesirable.
[217]
Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.
[218]
The Nazis used propaganda to promulgate the concept of
Rassenschande
("race defilement") to justify the need for racial laws.
[219]
In September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. These laws initially prohibited sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".
[220]
The law also forbade the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.
[221]
The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of "German or related blood" could be citizens.
[222]
Thus Jews and other non-Aryans were stripped of their German citizenship. The law also permitted the Nazis to deny citizenship to anyone who was not supportive enough of the regime.
[222]
A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed.
[223]
Military and paramilitary
Wehrmacht

, 1942
The unified armed forces of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the
Wehrmacht
(defence force). This included the
Heer
(army),
Kriegsmarine
(navy), and the
Luftwaffe
(air force). From 2 August 1934, members of the armed forces were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally. In contrast to the previous oath, which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments, this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal.
[224]
Hitler decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the
Einsatzgruppen
—the mobile death squads responsible for millions of murders in Eastern Europe—when it was tactically possible to do so.
[225]
Wehrmacht
troops also participated directly in
the Holocaust
by shooting civilians or committing genocide under the guise of anti-partisan operations.
[226]
The party line was that the Jews were the instigators of the partisan struggle and therefore needed to be eliminated.
[227]
On 8 July 1941, Heydrich announced that all Jews in the eastern conquered territories were to be regarded as partisans and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.
[228]
By August, this was extended to include the entire Jewish population.
[229]
In spite of efforts to prepare the country militarily, the economy could not sustain a lengthy war of attrition. A strategy was developed based on the tactic of
Blitzkrieg
("lightning war"), which involved using quick coordinated assaults that avoided enemy strong points. Attacks began with artillery bombardment, followed by bombing and strafing runs. Next the tanks would attack and finally the infantry would move in to secure the captured area.
[230]
Victories continued through mid-1940, but the failure to defeat Britain was the first major turning point in the war. The decision to attack the Soviet Union and the decisive defeat at Stalingrad led to the retreat of the German armies and the eventual loss of the war.
[231]
The total number of soldiers who served in the
Wehrmacht
from 1935 to 1945 was around 18.2 million, of whom 5.3 million died.

The
Sturmabteilung
(SA; Storm Detachment), or Brownshirts, founded in 1921, was the first paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party; their initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies.
[232]
They also took part in street battles against the forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others.
[233]
Under
Ernst Röhm
's leadership the SA grew by 1934 to over half a million members—4.5 million including reserves—at a time when the regular army was still limited to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty.
[234]
Röhm hoped to assume command of the army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA.
[235]
Hindenburg and Defence Minister
Werner von Blomberg
threatened to impose martial law if the activities of the SA were not curtailed.
[236]
Therefore, less than a year and a half after seizing power, Hitler ordered the deaths of the SA leadership, including Rohm. After the purge of 1934, the SA was no longer a major force.
[48]
Initially a small bodyguard unit under the auspices of the SA, the
Schutzstaffel
(SS; Protection Squadron) grew to become one of the largest and most powerful groups in Nazi Germany.
[237]
Led by
Reichsführer-SS
Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938.
[238]
Himmler initially envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence.
[239]
The
Waffen-SS
, the military branch of the SS, evolved into a second army. It was dependent on the regular army for heavy weaponry and equipment, and most units were under tactical control of the
High Command of the Armed Forces
(OKW).
[240]
[241]
By the end of 1942, the stringent selection and racial requirements that had initially been in place were no longer followed. With recruitment and conscription based only on expansion, by 1943 the Waffen-SS could not longer claim to be an elite fighting force.
[242]
SS formations committed many war crimes against civilians and allied servicemen.
[243]
From 1935 onward, the SS spearheaded the persecution of Jews, who were rounded up into ghettos and concentration camps.
[244]
With the outbreak of World War II, the SS
Einsatzgruppen
units followed the army into Poland and the Soviet Union, where from 1941 to 1945 they murdered more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.
[245]
A third of the
Einsatzgruppen
members were recruited from
Waffen-SS
personnel.
[246]
[247]
The
SS-Totenkopfverbände
(death's head units) ran the concentration camps and
extermination camps
, where millions more were murdered.
[248]
[249]
Up to 60,000 Waffen-SS men served in the camps.
[250]
In 1931, Himmler organised an SS intelligence service which became known as the
Sicherheitsdienst
(SD; Security Service) under his deputy, Heydrich.
[251]
This organisation was tasked with locating and arresting communists and other political opponents.
[252]
[253]
Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office. This holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses.
[254]

Economy

Economy of Nazi Germany
Reich economics
IG Farben
synthetic oil plant under construction at
Buna Werke
(1941). This plant was part of the complex at
Auschwitz concentration camp
.
The most pressing economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 per cent national unemployment rate.
[256]
Economist
Hjalmar Schacht
, President of the
Reichsbank
and Minister of Economics, created a scheme for deficit financing in May 1933. Capital projects were paid for with the issuance of promissory notes called
Mefo bills
. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money. Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the soaring national debt.
[257]
Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.
[256]
Economic recovery was uneven, with reduced hours of work and erratic availability of necessities, leading to disenchantment with the regime as early as 1934.
[258]
In October 1933, the
Junkers Aircraft Works
was expropriated. In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister Göring, production was ramped up. From a workforce of 3,200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932, the industry grew to employ a quarter of a million workers manufacturing over 10,000 technically advanced aircraft annually less than ten years later.
[259]
An elaborate bureaucracy was created to regulate imports of raw materials and finished goods with the intention of eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's
balance of payments
. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.
[260]
As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with
IG Farben
, guaranteeing them a 5 per cent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at
Leuna
. Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as excess profits were by then being generated.
[261]
In another attempt to secure an adequate wartime supply of petroleum, Germany intimidated
Romania
into signing a trade agreement in March 1939.
[262]
Major public works projects financed with deficit spending included the construction of a network of
Autobahnen
and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements.
[263]
To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs.
[264]
On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry, and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 per cent for each child born.
[265]
The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed outside the home was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.
[266]
Envisioning widespread car ownership as part of the new Germany, Hitler arranged for designer
Ferdinand Porsche
to draw up plans for the
KdF-wagen
(
Strength Through Joy
car), intended to be an automobile that everyone could afford. A prototype was displayed at the
International Motor Show
in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. None were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the
Volkswagen
(people's car).

Four Year Plan
(1942)
Six million people were unemployed when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million.
[268]
This was in part due to the removal of women from the workforce.
[269]
Real wages dropped by 25 per cent between 1933 and 1938.
[256]
After the dissolution of the trade unions in May 1933, their funds were seized and their leadership arrested,
[270]
including those who attempted to co-operate with the Nazis.
[40]
A new organisation, the
German Labour Front
, was created and placed under Nazi Party functionary
Robert Ley
.
[270]
Many unemployed people were forcibly drafted into this organisation, where they were given uniforms and tools and put to work. As a result, unemployed people disappeared from the streets, contributing to the perception that the Nazis were improving economic conditions.
[271]
The average work week was 43 hours in 1933; by 1939 this increased to 47 hours.
[272]
By early 1934, the focus shifted towards rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 per cent of the government's purchases of goods and services.
[273]
On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as
Plenipotentiary
of the Four Year Plan, intended to speed up rearmament.
[274]
In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants, and other factories, Göring instituted
wage and price controls
and restricted the issuance of
stock dividends
.
[256]
Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits.
[275]
Plans unveiled in late 1938 for massive increases to the navy and air force were impossible to fulfil, as Germany lacked the finances and material resources to build the planned units, as well as the necessary fuel required to keep them running.
[276]
With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the
Reichswehr
, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve.
[277]
By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.
[278]
Wartime economy and forced labour

plant in Auschwitz
The Nazi war economy was a
mixed economy
that combined a free market with central planning. Historian
Richard Overy
describes it as being somewhere in between the
command economy of the Soviet Union
and the
capitalist system of the United States
.
[279]
In 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister
Fritz Todt
, Hitler appointed Albert Speer as his replacement.
[280]
Wartime rationing of consumer goods led to an increase in personal savings, funds which were in turn lent to the government to support the war effort.
[281]
By 1944, the war was consuming 75 per cent of Germany's
gross domestic product
, compared to 60 per cent in the Soviet Union and 55 per cent in Britain.
[282]
Speer improved production by centralising planning and control, reducing production of consumer goods, and
using forced labour and slavery
.
[283]
[284]
The wartime economy eventually relied heavily upon the large-scale employment of
slave labour
. Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries to work in factories and on farms. Approximately 75 per cent were Eastern European.
[285]
Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection. Poor living conditions led to high rates of sickness, injury, and death, as well as sabotage and criminal activity.
[286]
The wartime economy also relied upon large-scale robbery, initially through the state seizing the property of Jewish citizens and later by plundering the resources of occupied territories.
[287]
Foreign workers
brought into Germany were put into four classifications: guest workers, military internees, civilian workers, and Eastern workers. Each group was subject to different regulations. The Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers.
[288]
[289]
By 1944, over a half million women served as auxiliaries in the German armed forces.
[290]
The number of women in paid employment only increased by 271,000 (1.8 per cent) from 1939 to 1944.
[291]
As the production of consumer goods had been cut back, women left those industries for employment in the war economy. They also took jobs formerly held by men, especially on farms and in family-owned shops.
[292]
Very heavy
strategic bombing
by the Allies
targeted refineries producing synthetic oil and gasoline
, as well as the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals.
[293]
The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible.
[294]
Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.
[295]
Financial exploitation of conquered territories
Main article:
Nazi plunder
German loot stored at Schlosskirche
Ellingen
, Bavaria (April 1945)
During the course of the war, the Nazis extracted considerable
plunder
from occupied Europe. Historian and war correspondent
William L. Shirer
writes: "The total amount of [Nazi] loot will never be known; it has proved beyond man's capacity to accurately compute."
[296]
Gold reserves
and other foreign holdings were seized from the
national banks
of occupied nations, while large "occupation costs" were usually imposed. By the end of the war, occupation costs were calculated by the Nazis at 60 billion Reichsmarks, with France alone paying 31.5 billion. The
Bank of France
was forced to provide 4.5 billion Reichsmarks in "credits" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of "fees" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the
United States Strategic Bombing Survey
concluded Germany had obtained 104 billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the
gross domestic product
of Belgium and the Netherlands.
[296]
Nazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions. Hitler and Göring in particular were interested in acquiring looted art treasures from occupied Europe,
[297]
the former planning to use the stolen art to fill the galleries of the planned
Führermuseum
(Leader's Museum),
[298]
and the latter for his personal collection. Göring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50 million Reichsmarks.
[297]
In 1940, the
Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce
was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.
[299]
By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.
[300]
In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing—items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany—for shipment home.
[301]
Goods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated 9,000,000 t (8,900,000 long tons; 9,900,000 short tons) of
cereals
were seized during the course of the war, including 75 per cent of its oats. In addition, 80 per cent of the country's oil and 74 per cent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5 billion
francs
. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.
[302]
Following Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, 2,000,000 t (2,000,000 long tons; 2,200,000 short tons) of fodder, 3,000,000 t (3,000,000 long tons; 3,300,000 short tons) of potatoes, and 662,000 t (652,000 long tons; 730,000 short tons) of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12 million pigs and 13 million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4 billion Reichsmarks. This relatively low number in comparison to the occupied nations of Western Europe can be attributed to the devastating fighting on the Eastern Front.

Racial policy and eugenics
Racism and antisemitism
Main articles:
Nazi racial theories
,
Racial policy of Nazi Germany
, and
Nazi eugenics
Racism and
antisemitism
were basic tenets of the Nazi Party and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief in the existence of a superior
master race
. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the
Aryan
master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.
[304]
Persecution of Jews
Further information:
Anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany
Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses
, April 1933. The posters say "Germans! Defend yourselves! Don't buy from Jews!"
Discrimination against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power. Following a month-long series of attacks by members of the SA on Jewish businesses and synagogues, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a
national boycott of Jewish businesses
.
[305]
The
Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service
passed on 7 April forced all non-Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service.
[306]
Similar legislation soon deprived other Jewish professionals of their right to practise, and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or grandparent was considered non-Aryan.
[307]
As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the
National Socialist German Students' League
removed from libraries any books considered un-German, and a nationwide
book burning
was held on 10 May.
[308]
The regime used violence and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave the country voluntarily.
[309]
Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks.
[310]
Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.
[311]
On 7 November 1938 a young Jewish man,
Herschel Grynszpan
, shot and killed
Ernst vom Rath
, a legation secretary at the German embassy in Paris, to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a
pogrom
the Nazis incited against the Jews two days later. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were murdered during this pogrom, later called
Kristallnacht
, the Night of Broken Glass.
[312]
[313]
Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months - they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library, or own weapons, and Jewish pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by

and told that any insurance settlements would be confiscated.
[314]
By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine, and other countries.
[315]
[316]
Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there under the terms of the
Haavara Agreement
, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind, and it was seized by the government.
[316]
Persecution of Romani
Main article:
Porajmos
Like the Jews, the
Romani
were subjected to persecution from the early days of the regime. The Romani were forbidden to marry people of German extraction. They were shipped to concentration camps starting in 1935 and many were murdered.
[189]
[190]
Following the invasion of Poland, 2,500 Roma and
Sinti
people were deported from Germany to the General Government, where they were imprisoned in labour camps. The survivors were likely exterminated at
Bełżec
,
Sobibor
, or
Treblinka
. A further 5,000 Sinti and Austrian Lalleri people were deported to the
Łódź Ghetto
in late 1941, where half were estimated to have died. The Romani survivors of the ghetto were subsequently moved to the
Chełmno extermination camp
in early 1942.
[317]
The Nazis intended on deporting all Romani people from Germany, and confined them to
Zigeunerlager
(Gypsy camps) for this purpose. Himmler ordered their deportation from Germany in December 1942, with few exceptions. A total of 23,000 Romani were deported to
Auschwitz concentration camp
, of whom 19,000 died. Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were murdered outright. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were murdered by the SS, the German Army, and
Einsatzgruppen
. In
occupied Serbia
, 1,000 to 12,000 Romani were murdered, while nearly all 25,000 Romani living in the
Independent State of Croatia
were murdered. The estimates at end of the war put the total number of Romani victims at around 220,000, which equalled approximately 25 per cent of the Romani population in Europe.
[317]
Other persecuted groups
Main article:
Aktion T4
Poster from the Nazi Party's

: "60 000 RM is what this person with hereditary illness costs the community in his lifetime. Fellow citizen, that is your money too."
Action T4 was a programme of systematic murder of the physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that took place mainly from 1939 to 1941, and continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the
Einsatzgruppen
and others;
gas chambers
and
gas vans
using
carbon monoxide
were used by early 1940.
[318]
[319]
Under the
Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring
, enacted on 14 July 1933, over 400,000 individuals underwent
compulsory sterilisation
.
[320]
Over half were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour, and cleanliness. Most of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless, and criminals.
[321]
Other groups persecuted and murdered included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits, and
members of the political and religious opposition
.
[190]
[322]
Generalplan Ost
Main articles:
Generalplan Ost
and
Anti-Slavic sentiment
Germany's war in the East
was based on Hitler's long-standing view that Jews were the great enemy of the German people and that
Lebensraum
was needed for Germany's expansion. Hitler focused his attention on Eastern Europe, aiming to conquer Poland and the Soviet Union.
[186]
[187]
Hitler's belief in the racial inferiority of Russians, as well as Slavs in general, had convinced him that a German conquest of Russia was inevitable.
[323]
After the occupation of Poland in 1939, all Jews living in the General Government were confined to
ghettos
, and those who were physically fit were required to perform compulsory labour.
[324]
In 1941 Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely; within 15 to 20 years the General Government was to be
cleared of ethnic Poles
and resettled by German colonists.
[325]
About 3.8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves,
[326]
part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations.
[187]
[327]
Nazi propaganda
depicted Eastern Europe as historically Germanic territories, promoting the myth that these regions were stolen from
Aryan races
by
Hunnic
and
Avar
tribes.
[328]
Hitler viewed Slavs as primitive subhumans and for this reason detested German alliance with
Austria-Hungary
during World War I. In his works such as
Mein Kampf
and
Zweites Buch
, Hitler viewed the Slavs as lacking the capability to form a state.
[329]
Anti-Slavism was also a core feature of
Nazi ideology
, which considered Slavs to be racially inferior
untermensch
. Through the
Generalplan Ost
("General Plan for the East"), Nazi Germany sought the total domination by Germanic peoples of Eastern Europe by conducting a
genocide
of Slavic inhabitants and forcibly deporting rest of the population beyond the
Urals
.
[330]
[331]
[332]
After launching Operation Barbarossa, German propaganda described the military campaign as a "European crusade against Bolshevism" to foreign powers. Meanwhile, their domestic propaganda depicted the war as a racial struggle of Aryans against "Jewish and Slavic
untermenschen
" to annihilate "
Judeo-Bolshevism
".
[333]
The
Reich Security Main Office
, under
Heinrich Himmler
, played an active role in distributing racist propaganda pamphlets on these topics across German-occupied territories.
[334]
To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the
Volksliste
, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood.
[335]
He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour.
[336]
[337]
The plan also included the
kidnapping of children
deemed to have Aryan-
Nordic
traits, who were presumed to be of German descent.
[338]
The goal was to implement
Generalplan Ost
after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed Hitler had to consider other options.
[339]
[340]
One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine, or Madagascar.
[324]
In addition, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the
Hunger Plan
. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.
[341]
Together, the Hunger Plan and
Generalplan Ost
would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union.
[342]
These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the
democidal
deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and
prisoners of war
(POWs) throughout the USSR and elsewhere in Europe.
[343]
During the course of the war, the
Soviet Union lost a total of 27 million people
; less than nine million of these were combat deaths.
[344]
One in four of the Soviet population were killed or wounded.
[345]
The Holocaust and Final Solution

Final Solution

Buchenwald concentration camp
liberated by the
U.S. Army
, 1945
Around the time of the failed offensive against Moscow in December 1941,
Hitler resolved
that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately.
[346]
While the murder of Jewish civilians had been ongoing in the occupied territories of Poland and the Soviet Union, plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the
Wannsee Conference
on 20 January 1942. Some would be
worked to death
and the rest would be murdered in the implementation of the
Final Solution to the Jewish Question
.
[347]
Initially the victims were murdered by
Einsatzgruppen
firing squads, then by
stationary gas chambers
or by
gas vans
, but these methods proved impractical for an operation of this scale.
[348]
[349]
By 1942 extermination camps equipped with gas chambers were established at
Auschwitz
,
Chełmno
, Sobibor, Treblinka, and elsewhere.
[350]
The total number of Jews murdered is estimated at 5.5 to six million,
[249]
including over a million children.
[351]
The Allies received information about the murders from the
Polish government-in-exile
and Polish leadership in Warsaw, based mostly on intelligence from the
Polish underground
.
[352]
[353]
German citizens had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the occupied territories reported on what they had seen and done.
[354]
Historian

Oppression of ethnic Poles
Further information:
Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)
Main article:
Nazi crimes against the Polish nation
Poles were viewed by Nazis as subhuman non-Aryans, and during the German
occupation of Poland
2.7 million ethnic Poles died.
[356]
Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry,
internment
,
wholesale expulsions
to make way for German colonists, and mass executions. The German authorities engaged in a systematic
effort to destroy Polish culture
and national identity. During operation
AB-Aktion
, many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested, transported to concentration camps, or executed. During the war, Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 per cent of its physicians and dentists, 26 to 57 per cent of its lawyers, 15 to 30 per cent of its teachers, 30 to 40 per cent of its scientists and university professors, and 18 to 28 per cent of its clergy.
[357]
Mistreatment of Soviet POWs
Main article:
German atrocities committed against Soviet prisoners of war
Soviet prisoners of war in
Mauthausen
The Nazis captured 5.75 million Soviet prisoners of war, more than they took from all the other Allied powers combined. Of these, they killed an estimated 3.3 million,
[358]
with 2.8 million of them being killed between June 1941 and January 1942.
[359]
Many POWs starved to death or resorted to cannibalism while being held in open-air pens at Auschwitz and elsewhere.
[360]
From 1942 onward, Soviet POWs were viewed as a source of forced labour, and received better treatment so they could work.
[361]
By December 1944, 750,000 Soviet POWs were working, including in German armaments factories (in violation of the
Hague
and
Geneva conventions
), mines, and farms.
[362]
Society
Education
Further information:
University education in Nazi Germany
Antisemitic legislation passed in 1933 led to the removal of all Jewish teachers, professors, and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required to belong to the
Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund
(NSLB; National Socialist Teachers League) and university professors were required to join the
National Socialist German Lecturers
.
[363]
[364]
Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler, and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed.
[365]
[366]
Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession. The average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.
[367]
Frequent and often contradictory directives were issued by Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick,
Bernhard Rust
of the
Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture
, and other agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools.
[368]
Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries.
[369]
Indoctrination in Nazi ideology was made compulsory in January 1934.
[369]
Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated from the age of 12 at
Adolf Hitler Schools
for primary education and
National Political Institutes of Education
for secondary education. Detailed indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at
Order Castles
.
[370]
The Nazi salute in school (1934): children were indoctrinated at an early age.
Primary and secondary education focused on racial biology, population policy, culture, geography, and physical fitness.
[371]
The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography, and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race.
[372]
Military education became the central component of physical education, and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics.
[373]
[374]
Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the
Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda
.
[369]
At universities, appointments to top posts were the subject of power struggles between the education ministry, the university boards, and the National Socialist German Students' League.
[375]
In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period.
[376]
This was especially true of universities located in predominantly Catholic regions.
[377]
Enrolment at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but enrolment in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors had been forced to leave the profession, so medical graduates had good job prospects.
[378]
From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA.
[379]
First-year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the
Reich Labour Service
; an additional ten weeks service were required of second-year students.
[380]
Role of women and family
Further information:
Women in Nazi Germany
Women were a cornerstone of Nazi social policy. The Nazis opposed the feminist movement, claiming that it was the creation of Jewish intellectuals, instead advocating a
patriarchal
society in which the German woman would recognise that her "world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home".
[269]
Feminist groups were shut down or incorporated into the
National Socialist Women's League
, which coordinated groups throughout the country to promote motherhood and household activities. Courses were offered on childrearing, sewing, and cooking. Prominent feminists, including
Anita Augspurg
,
Lida Gustava Heymann
, and
Helene Stöcker
, felt forced to live in exile.
[381]
The League published the
NS-Frauen-Warte
, the only Nazi-approved women's magazine in Nazi Germany;
[382]
despite some propaganda aspects, it was predominantly an ordinary woman's magazine.
[383]
Women were encouraged to leave the workforce, and the creation of large families by racially suitable women was promoted through propaganda campaigns. Women received a bronze award—known as the
Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter
(Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six, and gold for eight or more.
[381]
Large families received subsidies to help with expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five per cent between 1935 and 1940.
[384]
Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men, as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers, or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men.
[385]
Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used.
[386]
In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort.
[387]
Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs, and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.
[388]
Nazi leaders endorsed the idea that rational and theoretical work was alien to a woman's nature, and as such discouraged women from seeking higher education.
[389]
A law passed in April 1933 limited the number of females admitted to university to ten per cent of the number of male attendees.
[390]
This resulted in female enrolment in secondary schools dropping from 437,000 in 1926 to 205,000 in 1937. The number of women enrolled in post-secondary schools dropped from 128,000 in 1933 to 51,000 in 1938. However, with the requirement that men be enlisted into the armed forces during the war, women comprised half of the enrolment in the post-secondary system by 1944.
[391]
Young women of the
Bund Deutscher Mädel
(League of German Girls) practising gymnastics in 1941
Women were expected to be strong, healthy, and vital.
[392]
The sturdy peasant woman who
worked the land
and bore strong children was considered ideal, and women were praised for being athletic and tanned from working outdoors.
[393]
Organisations were created for the indoctrination of Nazi values. From 25 March 1939 membership in the
Hitler Youth
was made compulsory for all children over the age of ten.
[394]
The
Jungmädelbund
(Young Girls League) section of the Hitler Youth was for girls age 10 to 14, and the
Bund Deutscher Mädel
(BDM; League of German Girls) for young women age 14 to 18. The BDM's activities focused on physical education, with activities such as running, long-jumping, somersaulting, tightrope-walking, marching, and swimming.
[395]
The Nazi regime promoted a liberal code of conduct regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock.
[396]
Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. Soldiers' wives were frequently involved in extramarital relationships. Sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer.
[397]
Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.
[398]
With Hitler's approval, Himmler intended that the new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered by members of the SS, who were vetted for racial purity.
[399]
His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children.
[399]
The
Lebensborn
(Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes to accommodate single mothers during their pregnancies.
[400]
Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance.
[400]
The resulting children were often adopted into SS families.
[400]
The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and Nazi Party members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.
[401]
Existing laws banning abortion except for medical reasons were strictly enforced by the Nazi regime. The number of abortions declined from 35,000 per year at the start of the 1930s to fewer than 2,000 per year at the end of the decade, though in 1935 a law was passed allowing abortions for eugenics reasons.
[402]
Health
Statues representing the ideal body were erected in the streets of Berlin for the
1936 Summer Olympics
.
Nazi Germany had a strong
anti-tobacco movement
, as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between smoking and lung cancer.
[403]
The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets.
[404]
Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains, and among on-duty members of the military.
[405]
Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides.
[406]
As part of a general public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products, and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.
[407]
Government-run health care insurance plans were available, but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933. That same year, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat government-insured patients. In 1937, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat non-Jewish patients, and in 1938 their right to practice medicine was removed entirely.
[408]
Medical experiments, many of them
pseudoscientific
, were performed on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941.
[409]
The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS-
Hauptsturmführer
Josef Mengele
, camp doctor at Auschwitz.
[410]
Many of his victims died.
[411]
Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments.
[412]
Environmentalism
Further information:
Animal welfare in Nazi Germany
Nazi society had elements supportive of
animal rights
and many people were fond of zoos and wildlife.
[413]
The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research.
[414]
The law was only loosely enforced, and in spite of a ban on
vivisection
, the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.
[415]
The
Reich Forestry Office
under Göring enforced regulations that required foresters to plant a variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife, and a new Reich Animal Protection Act became law in 1933.
[416]
The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the natural landscape from excessive economic development. It allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long-range planning.
[417]
Perfunctory efforts were made to curb air pollution, but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began.
[418]
Religion
Main article:
Kirchenkampf
See also:
Religion in Nazi Germany
When the Nazis seized power in 1933, roughly 67 per cent of the population of Germany was
Protestant
, 33 per cent was
Roman Catholic
, while
Jews
made up less than 1 per cent.
[419]
[420]
According to 1939 census, 54 per cent considered themselves Protestant, 40 per cent Roman Catholic, 3.5 per cent
Gottgläubig
(God-believing; a Nazi religious movement) and 1.5 per cent
nonreligious
.
[1]
Nazi Germany extensively employed Christian imagery and instituted a variety of new Christian holidays and celebrations, such as a massive celebration marking the 1200th anniversary of the birth of Frankish emperor
Charlemagne
, who
Christianized neighbouring continental Germanic peoples
by force during the
Saxon Wars
.
[421]
Nazi propaganda stylised Hitler as a
Christ
-like
messiah
, a "figure of redemption according to the Christian model", "who would liberate the world from the Antichrist".
[422]
Under the
Gleichschaltung
process, Hitler attempted to create a
unified
Protestant Reich Church
from Germany's 28 existing Protestant
state churches
.
[423]
Pro-Nazi
Ludwig Müller
was installed as Reich Bishop and the pro-Nazi pressure group
German Christians
gained control of the new church.
[424]
They objected to the
Old Testament
because of its Jewish origins and demanded that converted Jews be barred from their church.
[425]
Pastor
Martin Niemöller
responded with the formation of the
Confessing Church
, from which some clergymen opposed the Nazi regime.
[426]
When in 1935 the Confessing Church synod protested the Nazi policy on religion, 700 of their pastors were arrested.
[427]
Müller resigned and Hitler appointed
Hanns Kerrl
as Minister for Church Affairs to continue efforts to control Protestantism.
[428]
In 1936, a Confessing Church envoy protested to Hitler against the religious persecutions and human rights abuses.
[427]
Hundreds more pastors were arrested.
[428]
The church continued to resist and by early 1937 Hitler abandoned his hope of uniting the Protestant churches.
[427]
Niemöller was arrested on 1 July 1937 and spent most of the next seven years in
Sachsenhausen concentration camp
and Dachau.
[429]
Theological universities were closed and pastors and theologians of other Protestant denominations were also arrested.

[430]
Persecution of the
Catholic Church in Germany
followed the Nazi takeover.
[431]
Hitler moved quickly to eliminate
political Catholicism
, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned
Bavarian People's Party
and
Catholic Centre Party
, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July.
[432]
The
Reichskonkordat
(Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment of the church in Germany.
[320]
The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.
[433]
Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious.
[434]
Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality.
[435]
Several Catholic leaders were targeted in the 1934
Night of the Long Knives
assassinations.
[436]
[437]
Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader
Baldur von Schirach
encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets.
[438]
Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.
[439]
Pope Pius XI
had the
"
Mit brennender Sorge
"
("With Burning Concern") encyclical smuggled into Germany for
Passion Sunday
1937 and read from every pulpit as it denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.
[435]
[440]
In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. Enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities.
[441]
Later Catholic protests included the 22 March 1942 pastoral letter by the German bishops on "The Struggle against Christianity and the Church".
[442]
About 30 per cent of Catholic priests were disciplined by police during the Nazi era.
[443]
[444]
A vast security network spied on the activities of clergy and priests were frequently denounced, arrested or sent to concentration camps - many to the dedicated
clergy barracks
at Dachau.
[445]
In the
areas of Poland annexed in 1939
, the Nazis instigated a
brutal suppression
and systematic dismantling of the Catholic Church.
[446]
[447]
Alfred Rosenberg
, head of the
Nazi Party Office of Foreign Affairs
and Hitler's appointed cultural and educational leader for Nazi Germany, considered Catholicism to be among the Nazis' chief enemies. He planned the "extermination of the foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany", and for the
Bible
and
Christian cross
to be replaced in all churches, cathedrals, and chapels with copies of
Mein Kampf
and the swastika. Other sects of Christianity were also targeted, with Chief of the
Nazi Party Chancellery
Martin Bormann
publicly proclaiming in 1941, "National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable."
[448]
Resistance to the regime

at the
Volksgerichtshof
in 1944
While no unified
resistance movement
opposing the Nazi regime existed, acts of defiance such as sabotage and labour slowdowns took place, as well as attempts to overthrow the regime or assassinate Hitler.
[449]
The banned Communist and Social Democratic parties set up resistance networks in the mid-1930s. These networks achieved little beyond fomenting unrest and initiating short-lived strikes.
[450]
Carl Friedrich Goerdeler
, who initially supported Hitler, changed his mind in 1936 and was later a participant in the
July 20 plot
.
[451]
[452]
The
Red Orchestra
spy ring provided information to the Allies about Nazi war crimes, helped orchestrate escapes from Germany, and distributed leaflets. The group was detected by the Gestapo and more than 50 members were tried and executed in 1942.
[453]
Communist and Social Democratic resistance groups resumed activity in late 1942, but were unable to achieve much beyond distributing leaflets. The two groups saw themselves as potential rival parties in post-war Germany, and for the most part did not co-ordinate their activities.
[454]
The
White Rose
resistance group was primarily active in 1942-43, and many of its members were arrested or executed, with the final arrests taking place in 1944.
[455]
Another civilian resistance group, the
Kreisau Circle
, had some connections with the military conspirators, and many of its members were arrested after the failed 20 July plot.
[456]
While civilian efforts had an impact on public opinion, the army was the only organisation with the capacity to overthrow the government.
[457]
[458]
A major plot by men in the upper echelons of the military originated in 1938. They believed Britain would go to war over Hitler's planned invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Germany would lose. The plan was to overthrow Hitler or possibly assassinate him. Participants included
Generaloberst

. The planned coup was cancelled after the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938.
[459]
Many of the same people were involved in a coup planned for 1940, but again the participants changed their minds and backed down, partly because of the popularity of the regime after the early victories in the war.
[460]
[461]
Attempts to assassinate Hitler resumed in earnest in 1943, with
Henning von Tresckow
joining Oster's group and attempting to blow up Hitler's plane in 1943. Several more attempts followed before the failed 20 July 1944 plot, which was at least partly motivated by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.
[462]
[463]
The plot, part of
Operation Valkyrie
, involved
Claus von Stauffenberg
planting a bomb in the conference room at
Wolf's Lair
at
Rastenburg
. Hitler, who narrowly survived, later ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.
[464]
Around 1940 a resistance group formed around the priest
Heinrich Maier
. The group passed on locations of production facilities for
V-2 rockets
,
Tiger tanks
, and aircraft to the Allies from late 1943 onwards. Allied bombers used this information to carry out air attacks. The Maier group provided information about the mass murder of Jews very early on; these reports were not initially believed by the Allies. The resistance group was uncovered and most of its members were imprisoned, tortured, or killed.

Culture

Nazi propaganda
If the experience of the Third Reich teaches us anything, it is that a love of great music, great art and great literature does not provide people with any kind of moral or political immunization against violence, atrocity, or subservience to dictatorship.
Richard J. Evans
,
The Coming of the Third Reich
(2003)
The regime promoted the concept of
Volksgemeinschaft
, a national German ethnic community. The goal was to build a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism.
[467]
[468]
The German Labour Front founded the
Kraft durch Freude
(KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. As well as taking control of tens of thousands of privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.
[469]
[470]
The
Reichskulturkammer
(Reich Chamber of Culture) was organised under the control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts, and many emigrated. Books and scripts had to be approved by the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.
[471]
Radio became popular in Germany during the 1930s; over 70 per cent of households owned a receiver by 1939, more than any other country. By July 1933, radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable.
[472]
Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.

Censorship
See also:
List of authors banned in Nazi Germany
Newspapers, like other media, were controlled by the state; the Reich Press Chamber shut down or bought newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over two-thirds of the newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry.
[475]
The Nazi Party daily newspaper, the
Völkischer Beobachter
("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Rosenberg, who also wrote
The Myth of the Twentieth Century
, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority.
[476]
Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. Under Goebbels, the Propaganda Ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely, especially regarding what to omit.
[477]
Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.
[478]
Propaganda became less effective towards the end of the war, as people were able to obtain information outside of official channels.
[479]
Authors of books left the country in droves and some wrote material critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths and the concept of
blood and soil
. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by the Nazi regime.
[480]
Nazi book burnings
took place; nineteen such events were held on the night of 10 May 1933.
[474]
Tens of thousands of books from dozens of figures, including
Albert Einstein
,
Sigmund Freud
,
Helen Keller
,
Alfred Kerr
,
Marcel Proust
,
Erich Maria Remarque
,
Upton Sinclair
,
Jakob Wassermann
,
H. G. Wells
, and
Émile Zola
were publicly burned. Pacifist works, and literature espousing liberal, democratic values were targeted for destruction, as well as any writings supporting the Weimar Republic or those written by Jewish authors.
[481]
Architecture and art
Main articles:
Nazi architecture
,
Art in Nazi Germany
, and
Music in Nazi Germany
Plans for Berlin called for the
Volkshalle
(People's Hall) and a
triumphal arch
to be built at either end of a wide boulevard.
Hitler took a personal interest in architecture and worked closely with state architects
Paul Troost
and
Albert Speer
to create public buildings in a
neoclassical
style based on
Roman architecture
.
[482]
[483]
Speer constructed imposing structures such as the
Nazi party rally grounds
in
Nuremberg
and a new
Reich Chancellery
building in Berlin.
[484]
Hitler's plans for rebuilding Berlin included a gigantic dome based on the
Pantheon
in Rome and a
triumphal arch
more than double the height of the
Arc de Triomphe
in Paris. Neither structure was built.
[485]
Hitler's belief that
abstract
,
Dadaist
,
expressionist
and
modern art
were decadent became the basis for policy.
[486]
Many art museum directors lost their posts in 1933 and were replaced by party members.
[487]
Some 6,500 modern works of art were removed from museums and replaced with works chosen by a Nazi jury.
[488]
Exhibitions of the rejected pieces, under titles such as "Decadence in Art", were launched in sixteen different cities by 1935. The
Degenerate Art Exhibition
, organised by Goebbels, ran in Munich from July to November 1937. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.
[489]
Composer
Richard Strauss
was appointed president of the
Reichsmusikkammer
(Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933.
[490]
As was the case with other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable and for the most part disapproved of music that was too modern or
atonal
.
[491]
Jazz
was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled.
[492]
Hitler favoured the music of
Richard Wagner
, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories, and attended the
Bayreuth Festival
each year from 1933 to 1942.
[493]
Film
Main article:
Nazism and cinema
Leni Riefenstahl
(behind cameraman) at the 1936 Summer Olympics
Movies were popular in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over a billion people in 1942, 1943, and 1944.
[494]
[495]
By 1934, German regulations restricting currency exports made it impossible for US film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies,
Universum Film AG
and
Tobis
, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.
[496]
Leni Riefenstahl
's
Triumph of the Will
(1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and
Olympia
(1938)—covering the
1936 Summer Olympics
—pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New techniques such as telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of Nazi ideals.

Denazification
Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg trials
The Allied powers organised war crimes trials, beginning with the
Nuremberg trials
, held from November 1945 to October 1946, of 23 top Nazi officials. They were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace,
war crimes
and
crimes against humanity
—in violation of international laws governing warfare.
[499]
All but three of the defendants were found guilty and twelve were sentenced to death.
[500]
Twelve
subsequent Nuremberg trials
of 184 defendants were held between 1946 and 1949.
[499]
Between 1946 and 1949, the Allies investigated 3,887 cases, of which 489 were brought to trial. The result was convictions of 1,426 people; 297 of these were sentenced to death and 279 to life in prison, with the remainder receiving lesser sentences. About 65 per cent of the death sentences were carried out.
[501]
Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, for example prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.
[502]
The political programme espoused by Hitler and the Nazis brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Europe. Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as
Stunde Null
(Zero Hour).
[503]
The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.
[504]
As a result, Nazi ideology and the actions taken by the regime are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral.
[505]
Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word "
evil
" to describe Hitler and the Nazi regime.
[506]
Interest in Nazi Germany continues in the media and the academic world. While Evans remarks that the era "exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity",
[507]
young neo-Nazis enjoy the shock value that Nazi symbols or slogans provide.
[508]
The display or use of
Nazi symbolism
such as flags,
swastikas
, or greetings is illegal in Germany and Austria.
[509]
Nazi Germany was succeeded by three states:
West Germany
(the Federal Republic of Germany or "FRG"),
East Germany
(the German Democratic Republic or "GDR"), and
Austria
.
[510]
The process of denazification, which was initiated by the Allies as a way to remove Nazi Party members was only partially successful, as the need for experts in such fields as medicine and engineering was too great. However, expression of Nazi views was frowned upon, and those who expressed such views were frequently dismissed from their jobs.
[511]
From the immediate post-war period through the 1950s, people avoided talking about the Nazi regime or their own wartime experiences. While virtually every family suffered losses during the war has a story to tell, Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes.
[512]
The trial of
Adolf Eichmann
in 1961 and the broadcast of the television miniseries
Holocaust
in 1978 brought the process of
Vergangenheitsbewältigung
(coping with the past) to the forefront for many Germans.
[508]
[512]
Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school
curriculum
starting in the 1970s, people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has led to the development of a strong democracy in Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and
neo-Nazi
thought.
[512]
In 2017, a
Körber Foundation
survey found that just 47 per cent of 14 to 16-year-olds in Germany knew what
Auschwitz
was.
[513]
[514]
The journalist
Alan Posener
attributed the country's "growing historical amnesia" in part to a failure by the German film and television industry to reflect the country's history accurately.

The
Sandover River
is an
ephemeral river
in the
Northern Territory
of
Australia
located in northeast
Central Australia
. It is the only major tributary of the
Georgina River
that does not rise in
western
Queensland
. Instead it flows from the eastern
Macdonnell Ranges
, northward to enter the Georgina near
Urandangi
. The highest point in the catchment is Bald Hill at 996 metres (3,268 ft), but it enters the Georgina at altitudes below 200 metres (660 ft).
Course and features
[
edit
]
The ephemeral Sandover River is usually dry except when the northern monsoon moves unusually far south into the continent. The average annual rainfall in the
catchment area
is typically around 275 millimetres (10.8 in) but varies greatly: in dry years like 1928 the total may be as low as 50 millimetres (2.0 in), but in very wet years like 1974, 2000, 2001 and 2010, it can be as high as 760 millimetres (30 in). Most of this rain falls in the summer: between December and March monthly totals have on several occasions exceeded the mean annual rainfall. Flows in the Sandover often fail to reach the Georgina, instead drying out in waterholes well west of Urandangie. However, in very wet periods, such as 1920-1921, 1973-1977 and 1999-2001, water from the Sandover may not only reach the Georgina, but actually flow (via a circuitous route) into
Lake Eyre
in
South Australia
.
The river is reported as passing through the localities of
Costello
and
Sandover
.  Both the
Sandover Highway
and the
Sandover Stock Route
are named after the river because their respective alignment follow that of the river.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The river was named in 1878 after
William Sandover
, the then President of the
Legislative Council of South Australia
, reportedly by the explorer and botanist.
Charles Winnecke
.

The Swan Road
(
Ukrainian
:
Лебединий шлях
,
romanized
:
Lebedýnyi šljax
) is the third album by the
Ukrainian
black metal
band
Drudkh
, released in
2005
. It is characterized by shorter songs and more prominent lyrics than are found on previous Drudkh releases. The lyrics are all taken from the epic poem
Haydamaky
, by Ukrainian national poet
Taras Shevchenko
,
[1]
about the Ukrainian
anti-Polish peasant rebellion of 1768
. The name of the introductory track refers to the year of the greatest
Cossack
anti-Polish uprising
set in Ukraine. The final track is an epic song on the destruction of
Zaporizhian Sich
by the Russian army in 1775. This album contains an increased use of
distortion
in the mix and more frequent usage of
blast beats
, but the last three tracks are considerably more low-key for Drudkh, with the final track ("Song of Sich Destruction") being a folk ballad, presaging the direction they would pursue further on the following year's
Songs of Grief and Solitude
.
Additionally, "Song of Sich Destruction" is not performed by Drudkh, but is a recording of a traditional Ukrainian
Duma
(folk song) performed by the
bandura
-player Igor Rachok.

Historian, professor
Leslie Michael Bethell
[1]
(born 12 February 1937) is an English historian and university professor, who specialises in the study of 19th- and 20th-century Latin America, focusing on Brazil in particular.
[2]
He received both his Bachelor of Arts and doctorate in history at the
University of London
.
[1]
He is emeritus professor of Latin American history, University of London, and emeritus fellow of
St Antony's College, University of Oxford
. Bethell has served as visiting professor at the
University Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro
, the
University of California, San Diego
, the
University of Chicago
, the Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro, the University of São Paulo and most recently the Brazil Institute, King's College London from 2011 to 2017.
[2]
He has been associated with the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars
for many years, most recently as senior scholar of the Brazil Institute from 2010 to 2015.
[2]
He was a fellow of St Antony's College and founding director of the Centre for Brazilian Studies at the
University of Oxford
from 1997 to 2007.
[3]
He was lecturer, reader and professor of Latin American history in the University of London from 1966 to 1992 and director of the University of London Institute of Latin American Studies from 1987 to 1992.
[2]
[4]
Bethell is the sole editor of the twelve-volume
Cambridge History of Latin America
, a massive attempt at compiling and integrating the existing scholarship of
Latin American studies
.
[5]
The entire project took more than twenty years to be completed.
[6]
The work was praised widely, with the historian
Paul Gootenberg
noting that the series had "earned rave scholarly reviews throughout the 1990s".
[7]
The
Library Journal
referred to the first two volumes of the series as "the most detailed, comprehensive, and authoritative work on the subject [colonial Latin America] available",
[8]
while the political scientist
Paul W. Drake
called various volumes in the set "landmark[s] in their field."
[9]
Reviews were not completely positive, however, with some of the volumes being described as "unwieldy"
[10]
and skewed too much to the present age.
[11]
Alternately, the series has also been criticised for its lack of coverage of issues whose impacts have extended into contemporary times and of the trends that had been emerging in Latin America around the time of its various publication dates.
[12]
[13]
[14]
Bethell was elected a
sócio correspondente
[one of twenty foreign members] of the
Brazilian Academy of Letters
in 2010.
[15]
He was nominated to fill the vacancy left by the death of the Portuguese author
José Saramago
, and was only the second English person to have been elected to the position, after the philosopher
Herbert Spencer
in 1898.
[3]
Bethell was also elected as a member of the
Brazilian Academy of Sciences
in 2004.
[16]
He was awarded the Ordem Nacional do Mérito Científico by the Brazilian government in 2010.

Zhang Xiaogang (2018)
Zhang Xiaogang
(
simplified Chinese
:
张晓刚
;
traditional Chinese
:
張曉剛
;
pinyin
:
Zhāng Xiǎogāng
; born in 1958) is a contemporary
Chinese
symbolist
and
surrealist
painter
. Paintings in his
Bloodline
series are predominantly monochromatic, stylized
portraits
of Chinese people, usually with large, dark-pupiled
eyes
, posed in a stiff manner deliberately reminiscent of family portraits from the 1950s and 1960s. Recently, he also created sculptures, translating for the first time into three dimensions many characters of the sort seen in his "Bloodlines—Big Family" portrait series.
[1]
These sculptures have featured in many exhibits and continue his work as one of China's leading, and most highly sought-after, contemporary artists.
Life and career
[
edit
]
Zhang was born to parents Qi Ailan and Zhang Jing (both government officials) in the city of
Kunming
in China's Yunnan province in 1958, and was the third of four brothers.
[2]
Zhang's mother, Qi Ailan taught him how to draw as an exercise to keep him out of trouble:
"From early on, my parents worried that I would go out and get into trouble. They gave us paper and crayons so we could draw at home. . . . I gained more and more interest in art. I had a lot of time, because I didn't have to go to school. My interest increased. After I became an adult, I never gave up art. So that's how I started to draw."
[3]
His parents were taken away for 3 years by the Chinese government for re-education. [3]He came of age during the 1960s and 1970s political upheavals known as the Cultural Revolution, which exerted a certain influence on his painting.
In early 1976, Xiaogang was sent to work on a farm as part of the "
Down to the Countryside Movement
".
[2]
Chinese water color painter, Lin Ling trained Xiaogang in 1975, teaching him formal water color and sketching techniques.
"When I was 17, I told myself I wanted to be an artist. . .  I felt that art was like a drug. Once you are addicted, you can't get rid of it."
[4]
Upon the reinstitution of collegiate entrance exams, Xiaogang was accepted into the Sichuan Academy of Fine arts in 1977 where he began study oil based painting in 1978. At the time of his collegiate education, Zhang's professors continued to teach styles of Revolutionary Realism as instituted by Chairman Mao. This only served to inspire Xiaogang and his peers to opt for topics of western philosophy and introspective individualism while shunning political and ideological subject matter.
In 1982, he graduated from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts in the city of Chongqing in Sichuan province but was denied a teaching post he had hoped for. This led Zhang to fall into a period of depression between 1982 and 1985. During this time he worked as a construction worker and art director for a social dance troupe in Kunming. It was a time of intense self-examination for Xiaogang as he had difficulties fitting into society. Suffering from alcoholism, he was hospitalized in 1984 with alcohol induced internal bleeding causing him to paint "The Ghost Between Black and White" series which put visual form to his visions of life and death in the hospital.
[5]
"At that time, my inspiration primarily came from the private feelings I had at the hospital. When I lay on the white bed, on the white bed sheet, I saw many ghost-like patients comforting each other in the crammed hospital wards. When night dawned, groaning sounds rose above the hospital and some of the withering bodies around had gone to waste and were drifting on the brink of death: these deeply stirred my feelings. They were so close to my then life experiences and lonely miserable soul."
[6]
In 1985, Xiaogang began to emerge from the dark time in his life and joined the New Wave movement in China that saw a philosophical, artistic and intellectual explosion in Chinese culture.
Zhang formed the South West Art Group in 1986 including fellow artists, Mao Xuhui, Pan Dehei, and Ye Yongqing among more than 80 others. The group moved for 'an anti-urban regionalism' and also explored individual desire which according to Zhang had been suppressed by collectivist rationalization. They created self funded exhibitions which were a foundational step in the Chinese Avant-Garde movement.
In 1988, Zhang was appointed as an instructor at Sichuan Academy's Education Department and married later that year. He took part in the China/Avant-Garde Exhibition in 1989 at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing. However, the
1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre
abruptly ended this period of liberal reform.
Zhang Xiaogang pursued the expressive and surreal style until the 1980s and early 90s. But after his trip to Europe in 1992, his style changes greatly.
[7]
Zhang traveled to Germany in 1992 for 3 months gaining unprecedented perspective on his own Chinese cultural identity. Upon returning he had a newfound desire to explore and revitalize his own personal past along with recent Chinese history through painting.
During his three - month stay in Germany, Zhang spent most of his time analyzing works by Western artists in museums. And he thought about his position as a Chinese artist. He said "I looked from the 'early phase' to the present for a position for myself, but even after this I still didn't know who I was. But an idea did emerge clearly: if I continue being an artist, I have to be an artist of 'China.'"
[8]
[9]
In Europe, too, Zhang begins to think about the Chinese face and reflects why he has brought images of people in books and magazines, not in actual surroundings.
[8]
[9]
Returning from Europe, Zhang Xiaogang was engaged in painting activities at Mao Xuhui's studio. He picked Tiananmen Square as the first theme and painted it using expressive strong brush touch.
It also begins to survey the faces of the surrounding Chinese. At this time, the photographs of the past quadruple found at the parents' house became a dramatic turning point. Drawing on a surrealism realistic painting, he abandons the style and begins to draw a flat picture. It also represents a Chinese identity by expressing a single eyelid.
[8]
[9]
Had a major conceptual breakthrough after discovering his family photos which reminded him of the memories destroyed by the contextual cultural setting of the time.
"I felt very excited, as if a door had opened. I could see a way to paint the contradictions between the individual and the collective and it was from this that I started really to paint. There's a complex relationship between the state and the people that I could express by using the Cultural Revolution. China is like a family, a big family. Everyone has to rely on each other and to confront each other. This was the issue I wanted to give attention to and, gradually, it became less and less linked to the Cultural Revolution and more to people's states of mind."
Xiaogang was particularly inspired by a photograph of his mother as a young attractive woman, a far cry from sickly, schizophrenic woman she had become. Led him to paint the BLOODLINES series which illustrated the entanglement of private and public life. In the mid 1990s, he exhibited all over the world including Brazil, France, Australia, UK and the US.
[5]
'Bloodline: Big Family series' of Zhang Xiaogang were exhibited The Other Face: Three Chinese Artists as part of the larger international exhibition Identità e Alterità, installed in the Italian Pavilion during the centenary 46th Venice Biennale in 1995.
[10]
Like
Wang Guangyi
,
Xu Beihong
and
Wu Guanzhong
, Zhang Xiaogang is a best-selling contemporary Chinese artist and a favorite of foreign collectors.
[11]
His paintings feature prominently in the 2005 film
Sunflower
.
In 2007, a canvas of his sold for US$6 million at
Sotheby's
[12]
while in April 2011 his 1988 triptych oil work
Forever Lasting Love
, of half-naked figures in an arid landscape suffused with mystical symbols, sold for HK$79 million (US$10.1 million), a record auction price for a contemporary artwork from China, in Hong Kong.
[13]
[14]
He is represented by
Pace Gallery
in New York/Beijing and
Beijing Commune
in Beijing for his prints.
Zhang, like other Chinese contemporary artists at one time, was not able to exhibit in China because his works were too modern and suspicious. But now his paintings are popular in China as well not just in Western society so now he has chances to exhibit at museums and galleries in China compared in the past.
[15]
[16]
In recent years, he has expanded not only his oil painting works, but also his installation works of sculpture works.
[17]
Influences
[
edit
]
Western painters including
Richter
,
[18]
Picasso
and
Dalí
are influences. Zhang said: "I read in a book once a few words by British experimental artist
Eduardo Paolozzi
, which were very influential for me: 'a person can very easily have the right idea, but choose the wrong means to express it. Or he can have the right means, but lack a clear idea.'" Zhang also cites his discovery of photos of his mother as a young, attractive woman as a key inspiration for the
Bloodline
series.
After participating "I Don't Want to Play Cards with Cézanne" and Other Works, organized by the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, California, Zhang started thinking about his way of work and decided not to paint same way with famous Western art and be an independent artist.
[19]
Analysis
[
edit
]
Referring to the
Bloodline
paintings, Zhang noted that old photographs "are a particular visual language" and says: "I am seeking to create an effect of 'false photographs' — to re-embellish already 'embellished' histories and lives." He said: "On the surface the faces in these portraits appear as calm as still water, but underneath there is great emotional turbulence. Within this state of conflict the propagation of obscure and ambiguous destinies is carried on from generation to generation."
Regarding the influences of China's political upheavals on his paintings, Zhang said, "For me, the Cultural Revolution is a
psychological
state, not a
historical
fact. It has a very strict connection with my childhood, and I think there are many things linking the psychology of the Chinese people today with the psychology of the Chinese people back then."
Regarding the portrait-like format of the works, he noted, "Posing for a photograph, people already display a certain formality. It is already something artificial. What I do is increase this artificiality and this sense of formalism."
Asked about the full title of the Bloodline series.
Bloodline: the Big Family
, Zhang said:
We all live 'in a big family'. The first lesson we have to learn is how to protect ourselves and keep our experiences locked up in an inner chamber away from the prying eyes of others, while at the same time living in harmony as a member of this big family. In this sense, the "family" is a unit for the continuity of life and an idealized mechanism for procreation. It embodies power, hope, life, envy, lies, duty and love. The 'family' becomes the standard model and the focus for the contradictions of life experiences. We interact and depend on each other for support and assurance.
The
Bloodline
paintings often feature small patches of colour, which are open to a variety of interpretations.
"Mother and Son"
This is the first Bloodline series Zhang Xiaogang painted as his mother in 1993.
It is a picture of a distinctly different style from the Bloodline series we now know.
No-face figures appear, but they have their own individuality and can pinpoint the elements that they want to talk about from place to place in the picture.
[20]
As the series progresses, the figures in Zhang Xiaogang's paintings become blurred and the clothes change to Mao suites. His distinctive face, the small eyes and the slender face, which he created, are characteristic of his paintings.
[7]
Two comrades with red baby
'Two comrades with red baby' is one of Zhang Xiaogang's "Bloodline: The Big Family" series from China and is currently on display at the National Gallery of Australia.
The painting measures 150.0 cm high x 180.0 cm wide and was painted with oil on canvas.
[21]
This picture, which was created with the motif of a black and white family photograph found in 1993 when he visited his parents' house, is a two-comrades behind the title and a red baby in the center. There are white traces in common on the left cheek of three expressionless people, and thin red lines connect them. The faces, hair styles, fashion, facial expressions, and the like of the characters that appear almost identical in this work convey the social atmosphere that was uniform in Mao period. The red child symbolizing the Red Guards in the era of the Cultural Revolution represents the phenomenon that even the parents were accusing at the time, but the red line connecting the three characters indicates that these three are family members. The white traces on these cheeks represent their indelible wounds.</ref name=sothebys.com>
Zhang said baby like a seed of evil, not of joy in his painting.
[7]
Their unfocused eyes appear to be looking at the viewer. In other words, the viewer can feel their painful feelings in painting by facing their eyes. In other words, Zhang's painting is the medium through which we can communicate with those of the past.
[22]
Father and Daughter
Unlike his work, which started as a mother and son in the 2000s, father and daughter emerge. Also, Unlike the works of the 90s, it is mainly light gray rather than black, giving a brighter atmosphere, but it is also ambiguous. The elements that have been regarded as representatives of the Mao era are disappearing and focusing on the expression of the characters. The white patches are reddish and so are more prominent.

Moses N. Wisewell was born at
Brandon, Vermont
, May 15, 1827.
[1]
He was a
civil engineer
and merchant before the Civil War.
[1]
As
colonel
, Wisewell commanded the
28th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry Regiment
from September 22, 1862.
[1]

Battle of Fredericksburg
on December 13, 1862, he was seriously wounded.
[1]
He was transferred to the
Veteran Reserve Corps
as a colonel on September 25, 1863.
[1]
From November 9, 1863, to December 20, 1864, Wisewell served in the Veterans Reserve Branch, Provost Marshal General Department.

Robert Coolen
(born January 24, 1958)
[2]
is an American softball coach who is currently the head coach of the
University of Hawaii's
softball program
.
Personal life and education
[
edit
]
A native of
Somerville, Massachusetts
, Coolen was a multi-sport athlete at
Wesleyan University
, where he played
wide receiver
on the school's football team, a pitcher on the baseball team, and a member of the swim team. He turned down an appointment from the
United States Naval Academy
to play at Wesleyan.
[3]
He graduated from Wesleyan in 1980 with a degree in government and earned a master's degree in human movement from
Boston University
in 1986. Coolen and his wife Nanci have two children, Demi and Bo. Bo was the associate head coach for the baseball team at
Westcliff University
.
[4]
He has since moved to
Grace College
as co-head coach of the softball team with his wife Sam.
[5]
Coaching career
[
edit
]
Coolen started his coaching career at
Bentley University
in
Waltham, Massachusetts
, working as the head coach of the university's softball team and swimming team. In addition to his duties as the head coach of the two teams, Coolen also served as the equipment and facilities manager. Coolen left Bentley to join Rayla Allison's coaching staff at
Hawaii
in 1990 as an assistant.
Hawaii
[
edit
]
After Allison resigned to become the first full-time executive director of the National Fastpitch Coaches Association, Coolen was named the head coach of the Wahine softball team in 1992.
[6]
Coolen and his staff led a 2010 Wahine squad that shattered the record for most home runs by a team in a single season, en route to a WAC championship and a berth in the NCAA tournament.
[7]
Following a win in the Tuscaloosa regional over #1 seed
Alabama
, Hawaii advanced to the Women's College World Series, the Wahine's first and only Women's College World Series appearance to date.
Coolen earned his 1000th win on April 13, 2019, with a 5-2 win over
UC Santa Barbara
, joining
Dave Shoji
,
Les Murakami
, and Jim Schwitters as the only coaches to win 1,000 games in the history of the university's athletic department.
[8]
[9]
Coolen signed a two-year contract extension in 2023 to remain the head coach at Hawaii through the 2025 season, which is scheduled to be his final season before retirement.

ⓘ
)
[note 1]
is
Earth
's southernmost and least-populated
continent
. Situated almost entirely south of the
Antarctic Circle
and surrounded by the
Southern Ocean
(also known as the
Antarctic Ocean
), it contains the geographic
South Pole
. Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, being about 40% larger than
Europe
, and has an area of 14,200,000 km
2
(5,500,000 sq mi). Most of Antarctica is covered by the
Antarctic ice sheet
, with an average thickness of 1.9 km (1.2 mi).
Antarctica is, on average, the coldest, driest, and windiest of the continents, and it has the highest average
elevation
. It is mainly a
polar desert
, with annual
precipitation
of over 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's
freshwater
reserves are frozen in Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise global
sea levels
by almost 60 metres (200 ft). Antarctica holds the record for the
lowest measured temperature on Earth
, −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F). The coastal regions can reach temperatures over 10 °C (50 °F) in summer. Native
species of animals
include
mites
,
nematodes
,
penguins
,
seals
and
tardigrades
. Where
vegetation
occurs, it is mostly in the form of
lichen
or
moss
.
The
ice shelves of Antarctica
were probably first seen in 1820, during
a Russian expedition
led by
Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen
and
Mikhail Lazarev
. The decades that followed saw further
exploration
by French, American, and British expeditions. The first confirmed landing was by a Norwegian team in 1895. In the early 20th century, there were a few expeditions into the interior of the continent.
British explorers
were the first to reach the
magnetic South Pole
in 1909, and the
geographic South Pole
was first reached in 1911 by
Norwegian explorers
.
Antarctica is
governed by about 30 countries
, all of which are parties of the 1959
Antarctic Treaty System
. According to the terms of the treaty, military activity, mining,
nuclear explosions
, and
nuclear waste disposal
are all prohibited in Antarctica.
Tourism
, fishing and research are the main human activities in and around Antarctica. During the summer months, about 5,000 people reside at
research stations
, a figure that drops to around 1,000 in the winter. Despite its remoteness, human activity has a significant impact on the continent via
pollution
,
ozone depletion
, and
climate change
.
Etymology
A speculative representation of Antarctica labelled as '
Terra Australis Incognita
' on
Jan Janssonius
's
Zeekaart van het Zuidpoolgebied
(1657),
Het Scheepvaartmuseum
The name given to the continent
originates
from the word
antarctic
, which comes from
Middle French
antartique
or
antarctique
('opposite to the
Arctic
') and, in turn, the
Latin
antarcticus
('opposite to the north').
Antarcticus
is derived from the
Greek
ἀντι-
('anti-') and
ἀρκτικός
('of
the Bear
', 'northern').
[4]
The Greek philosopher
Aristotle
wrote in
Meteorology
about an "Antarctic region" in
c.
350 BCE
.
[5]
The Greek geographer
Marinus of Tyre
reportedly used the name in his world map from the second century CE, now lost. The
Roman
authors
Gaius Julius Hyginus
and
Apuleius
used for the South Pole the
romanised
Greek name
polus antarcticus
,
[6]
from which derived the
Old French
pole antartike
(modern
pôle antarctique
) attested in 1270, and from there the
Middle English
pol antartik
, found first in a
treatise
written by the English author
Geoffrey Chaucer
.
[4]
Belief by Europeans in the existence of a
Terra Australis
—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to balance the northern lands of Europe, Asia, and North Africa—had existed as an intellectual concept since
classical antiquity
. The belief in such a land lasted until the European
discovery of Australia
.
[7]
During the early 19th century, explorer
Matthew Flinders
doubted the existence of a detached continent south of Australia (then called
New Holland
) and thus advocated for the "Terra Australis" name to be used for Australia instead.
[8]
[9]
In 1824, the colonial authorities in
Sydney
officially renamed the continent of New Holland to Australia, leaving the term "Terra Australis" unavailable as a reference to Antarctica. Over the following decades, geographers used phrases such as "the Antarctic Continent". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting names such as
Ultima
and
Antipodea
.
[10]
Antarctica
was adopted in the 1890s, with the first use of the name being attributed to the Scottish
cartographer
John George Bartholomew
.

Eastern Antarctica
is to the right of the

is to the left.
Positioned asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the
Antarctic Circle
(one of the five major
circles of latitude
that mark maps of the world), Antarctica is surrounded by the
Southern Ocean
.
[note 2]
Rivers
exist in Antarctica, the longest is the
Onyx
. Antarctica covers more than 14.2 million km
2
(5,500,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest continent, slightly less than 1.5 times the area of the United States. Its coastline is almost 18,000 km (11,200 mi) long:
[1]
as of 1983
, of the four coastal types, 44% of the coast is floating ice in the form of an
ice shelf
, 38% consists of ice walls that rest on rock, 13% is
ice streams
or the edge of glaciers, and the remaining 5% is exposed rock.
[13]
The
lakes
that lie at the base of the continental
ice sheet
occur mainly in the
McMurdo Dry Valleys
or various
oases
.
[14]
Lake Vostok
, discovered beneath Russia's
Vostok Station
, is the largest
subglacial lake
globally and one of the largest lakes in the world. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for millions of years, but scientists now estimate its water is replaced by the slow melting and freezing of ice caps every 13,000 years.
[15]
During the summer, the ice at the edges of the lakes can melt, and liquid moats temporarily form. Antarctica has both
saline
and freshwater lakes.
[14]
Antarctica is divided into
West Antarctica
and
East Antarctica
by the
Transantarctic Mountains
, which stretch from
Victoria Land
to the
Ross Sea
.
[16]
[17]
The vast majority of Antarctica is covered by the
Antarctic ice sheet
, which averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi) in thickness.
[18]
The ice sheet extends to all but a few
oases
, which, with the exception of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, are located in coastal areas.
[19]
Several Antarctic ice streams flow to one of the many
Antarctic ice shelves
, a process described by
ice-sheet dynamics
.
[20]

East Antarctica comprises
Coats Land
,
Queen Maud Land
,
Enderby Land
,
Mac
. Robertson Land
,
Wilkes Land
, and Victoria Land. All but a small portion of the region lies within the
Eastern Hemisphere
. East Antarctica is largely covered by the
East Antarctic Ice Sheet
.
[21]
There are numerous
islands
surrounding Antarctica, most of which are volcanic and very young by geological standards.
[22]
The most prominent exceptions to this are the islands of the
Kerguelen Plateau
, the earliest of which formed around 40
Ma
.
[22]
[23]
Vinson Massif
, in the
Ellsworth Mountains
, is the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892 m (16,050 ft).
[24]
Mount Erebus on
Ross Island
is the world's southernmost active
volcano
and
erupts
around 10 times each day. Ash from eruptions has been found 300 kilometres (190 mi) from the
volcanic crater
.
[25]
There is evidence of a large number of volcanoes under the ice, which could pose a risk to the ice sheet if activity levels were to rise.
[26]
The ice dome known as
Dome Argus
in East Antarctica is the highest Antarctic ice feature, at 4,091 metres (13,422 ft). It is one of the world's coldest and driest places—temperatures there may reach as low as −90 °C (−130 °F), and the annual precipitation is 1-3 cm (0.39-1.18 in).
[27]
Geologic history
Main article:
Geology of Antarctica
Further information:
Geology of the Antarctic Peninsula
From the end of the
Neoproterozoic
era to the
Cretaceous
, Antarctica was part of the
supercontinent
Gondwana.
[28]
Modern Antarctica was formed as
Gondwana
gradually broke apart beginning around 183 Ma.
[29]
For a large proportion of the
Phanerozoic
, Antarctica had a
tropical
or
temperate climate
, and it was covered in forests.
[30]
Palaeozoic era (540-250 Ma)
Glossopteris
sp. leaf from the Permian of Antarctica
During the
Cambrian period
, Gondwana had a mild climate.
[31]
West Antarctica was partially in the
Northern Hemisphere
, and during the time, large amounts of
sandstones
,
limestones
, and
shales
were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where seafloor
invertebrates
and
trilobites
flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the
Devonian period
(416
Ma
), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes, and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from then. Sand and
silts
were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth,
Horlick
and
Pensacola Mountains
.
Antarctica became glaciated during the
Late Paleozoic icehouse
beginning at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), though glaciation would substantially increase during the late
Carboniferous
. It drifted closer to the South Pole, and the climate cooled, though
flora
remained.
[32]
After deglaciation during the latter half of the Early
Permian
, the land became dominated by
glossopterids
(an extinct group of seed plants with no close living relatives), most prominently
Glossopteris
, a tree interpreted as growing in waterlogged soils, which formed extensive coal deposits. Other plants found in Antarctica during the Permian include
Cordaitales
,
sphenopsids
, ferns, and
lycophytes
.
[33]
At the end of the Permian, the climate became drier and hotter over much of Gondwana, and the
glossopterid
forest ecosystems collapsed, as part of the
End-Permian mass extinction
.
[33]
[34]
There is no evidence of any
tetrapods
having lived in Antarctica during the Paleozoic.
[35]
Mesozoic era (250-66 Ma)
The continued warming dried out much of Gondwana. During the Triassic, Antarctica was dominated by
seed ferns
(pteridosperms) belonging to the genus
Dicroidium
, which grew as trees. Other associated Triassic flora included
ginkgophytes
,
cycadophytes
,
conifers
, and sphenopsids.
[36]
Tetrapods
first appeared in Antarctica during the early
Triassic
, with the earliest known fossils found in the
Fremouw Formation
of the Transantarctic Mountains.
[35]
Synapsids
(also known as "mammal-like reptiles") included species such as
Lystrosaurus
, and were common during the
Early Triassic
.
[37]
The
Antarctic Peninsula
began to form during the
Jurassic
period (
million years ago
).
[38]
Ginkgo
trees, conifers,
Bennettitales
,
horsetails
, ferns and cycads were plentiful during the time.
[39]
In West Antarctica, coniferous forests dominated throughout the Cretaceous period (146-66 Ma), though southern beech trees (
Nothofagus
) became prominent towards the end of the Cretaceous.
[40]
[41]
Ammonites
were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only a few Antarctic dinosaur
genera
(
Cryolophosaurus
and
Glacialisaurus
, from the Early Jurassic
Hanson Formation
of the Transantarctic Mountains,
[42]
and
Antarctopelta
,
Trinisaura
,
Morrosaurus
and
Imperobator
from Late Cretaceous of the Antarctic Peninsula) have been described.

)
[note 3]
Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic around 160 Ma, followed by the
Indian subcontinent
in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma).
[47]
During the early
Paleogene
, Antarctica remained connected to South America as well as to southeastern Australia. Fauna from the
La Meseta Formation
in the Antarctic Peninsula, dating to the
Eocene
, is very similar to equivalent South American faunas; with
marsupials
,
xenarthrans
,
litoptern
, and
astrapotherian
ungulates
, as well as
gondwanatheres
and possibly
meridiolestidans
.
[48]
[49]
Marsupials are thought to have dispersed into Australia via Antarctica by the early Eocene.
[50]
Around 53 Ma, Australia-
New Guinea
separated from Antarctica, opening the
Tasmanian Passage
.
[51]
The
Drake Passage
opened between Antarctica and South America around 30 Ma, resulting in the creation of the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current
that completely isolated the continent.
[52]
Models of Antarctic geography suggest that this current, as well as a
feedback loop
caused by lowering
CO
2
levels, caused the creation of small yet permanent polar ice caps. As CO
2
levels declined further the ice began to spread rapidly, replacing the forests that until then had covered Antarctica.
[53]
Tundra
ecosystems continued to exist on Antarctica until around 14-10 million years ago, when further cooling lead to their extermination.

The
Antarctic Plate
The
geology
of Antarctica, largely obscured by the continental ice sheet,
[55]
is being revealed by techniques such as
remote sensing
,
ground-penetrating radar
, and
satellite imagery
.
[56]
Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the South American
Andes
.
[57]
The Antarctic Peninsula was formed by
geologic uplift
and the transformation of sea bed
sediments
into
metamorphic rocks
.
[58]
West Antarctica was formed by the merging of several
continental plates
, which created a number of mountain ranges in the region, the most prominent being the Ellsworth Mountains. The presence of the
West Antarctic Rift System
has resulted in
volcanism
along the border between West and East Antarctica, as well as the creation of the Transantarctic Mountains.
[59]
East Antarctica is geologically varied. Its formation began during the
Archean
Eon (4,000 Ma-2,500 Ma), and stopped during the Cambrian Period.
[60]
It is built on a
craton
of rock, which is the basis of the Precambrian
Shield
.
[61]
On top of the base are
coal
and sandstones, limestones, and shales that were laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains.
[62]
In coastal areas such as the
Shackleton Range
and Victoria Land, some
faulting
has occurred.
[63]
[64]
Coal was first recorded in Antarctica near the
Beardmore Glacier
by
Frank Wild
on the
Nimrod
Expedition
in 1907, and low-grade coal is known to exist across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains.
[65]
The
Prince Charles Mountains

Temperate conditions near the coast in December
Antarctica is the coldest, windiest, and driest of Earth's continents.
[1]
The lowest natural air temperature ever recorded on Earth was −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) at the Russian Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983.
[68]
A lower air temperature of −94.7 °C (−138.5 °F) was recorded in 2010 by satellite—however, it may have been influenced by ground temperatures and was not recorded at a height of 2 m (7 ft) above the surface as required for official air temperature records.
[69]
Average temperatures can reach a minimum of between −80 °C (−112 °F) in the interior of the continent during winter and a maximum of over 10 °C (50 °F) near the coast in summer.
[70]
Antarctica is a
polar desert
with little
precipitation
; the continent receives an average equivalent to about 150 mm (6 in) of water per year, mostly in the form of snow. The interior is dryer and receives less than 50 mm (2 in) per year, whereas the coastal regions typically receive more than 200 mm (8 in).
[71]
In a few
blue-ice areas
, the wind and
sublimation
remove more snow than is accumulated by precipitation.
[72]
In the dry valleys, the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a barren and
desiccated
landscape.
[73]
Antarctica is colder than the
Arctic
region, as much of Antarctica is over 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level, where air temperatures are colder. The relative warmth of the
Arctic Ocean
is transferred through the
Arctic sea ice
and moderates temperatures in the Arctic region.
[74]
Regional differences
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation.
Weather fronts
rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry, with moderate wind speeds. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of Antarctica, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 m (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded. At the continent's edge, strong
katabatic winds
off of the
polar plateau
often blow at
storm force
. During the summer, more
solar radiation
reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the
equator
because of the 24 hours of sunlight received there each day.
[1]
Climate change
Main article:
Climate change in Antarctica
The warming trend for Antarctica from 1957 to 2006, based on the analysis of
weather station
and
satellite
data; dark tints over West Antarctica indicate that the region warmed most per decade.
Over the second half of the 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula was the fastest-warming place on Earth, closely followed by West Antarctica, but temperatures rose less rapidly during the early 21st century.
[75]
Conversely, the South Pole, located in East Antarctica, barely warmed during much of the 20th century, but temperatures rose three times the global average between 1990 and 2020.
[76]
In February 2020, the continent recorded its highest temperature of 18.3 °C (64.9 °F), which was 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) higher than the previous record attained in March 2015.
[77]
A main component of climate variability in Antarctica is the
Southern Annular Mode
(a low-frequency
mode of atmospheric variability
of the
Southern Hemisphere
), which showed strengthened winds around Antarctica in the summer of the later decades of the 20th century, associated with cooler temperatures over the continent. The trend was at a scale unprecedented over the last 600 years; the most dominant driver of the mode of variability is likely the
depletion of ozone
above the continent.
[78]
Glaciers and floating ice
See also:
Sea level rise
and
Antarctic sea ice
Pine Island Glacier
, photographed in November 2011
Precipitation in Antarctica occurs in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms the giant ice sheet that covers the continent.
[79]
Under the force of gravity, the ice flows towards the coast. The ice then moves into the ocean, often forming vast floating
ice shelves
. These shelves can melt or form
icebergs
that eventually disintegrate when they reach warmer ocean waters.
[80]
Sea ice and ice shelves
Main article:
List of Antarctic ice shelves
Sea ice extent expands annually during the Antarctic winter, but most of it melts in the summer.
[81]
The ice is formed from the ocean, and does not contribute to changes in sea level.
[82]
The average extent of sea ice around Antarctica has changed little since satellites began to observe the Earth's surface in 1978; which is in contrast with the Arctic, where there has been rapid sea ice loss. A possible explanation is that
thermohaline circulation
transports warmed water to deeper layers in the Southern Ocean so that the surface remains relatively cool.
[83]
The melting of the ice shelves does not contribute much to sea level rise, as the floating ice displaces its own mass of water, but the ice shelves act to stabilize the land ice. They are vulnerable to warming water, which has caused large ice shelves to collapse into the ocean.
[84]
The loss of ice shelf "buttressing" has been identified as the major cause of ice loss on the West Antarctic ice sheet, but has also been observed around the East Antarctic ice sheet.
[85]
In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's
Larsen-B
ice shelf collapsed.
[86]
In early 2008, about 570 km
2
(220 sq mi) of ice from the
Wilkins Ice Shelf
on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km
2
(5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a "thread" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide,
[87]
[88]
prior to its collapse in 2009.
[89]
As of 2022
, the two most rapidly thinning ice shelves are those in front of the
Pine Island
and
Thwaites glaciers
. Both ice shelves act to stabilise the glaciers that feed into them.
[90]
Ice sheet loss and sea level rise
Main article:
Climate change in Antarctica
Ice mass loss since 2002
Antarctica contains about 90% of the world's ice. If all of this ice were melted, global sea levels would rise about 58 m (190 ft).
[91]
In addition, Antarctica stores around 70% of global freshwater as ice.
[92]
The continent is losing mass due to the increased flow of its glaciers toward the ocean.
[93]
The loss of mass from Antarctica's ice sheets is partially offset by additional snow falling back onto it.
[94]
A 2018
systematic review
study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43
gigatonnes (Gt) per year
on average during the period from 1992 to 2002, but accelerated to an average of 220 Gt per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.
[95]
Antarctica's total contribution to sea level rise has been estimated to be 8 to 14 mm (0.31 to 0.55 in).
[94]
[93]
Most of the ice loss has taken place on the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica.
[96]
Estimates of the mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole range from slightly positive to slightly negative.
[93]
[97]
Increased ice outflow has been observed in some regions of East Antarctica, particularly at Wilkes Land.
[93]
Future projections of ice loss depend on the speed of
climate change mitigation
and are uncertain. When a certain threshold warming is reached, some parts of the ice sheet may start melting at a significantly faster rate, and become committed to disappearing in the future. If average temperatures were to begin to fall, the ice would not immediately be restored.
[98]
Some research (2020) suggests that once warming commits the Antarctic ice sheet to a certain level of ice loss, the only way to prevent that loss from happening is through lowering the global temperature to 1 °C (1.8 °F)
below
the preindustrial level: that is, 2 °C (3.6 °F) below the temperature of 2020.
[99]
A study published in 2023 projected that ocean warming at about triple the historical rate is likely unavoidable in the 21st century, with no significant difference between mid-range emissions scenarios versus achieving the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement—suggesting that
greenhouse gas mitigation
has limited ability to prevent collapse of the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet
.
[100]
Pine Island Bay
, the location of both Thwaites (TEIS refers to Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf) and Pine Island Glaciers. These glaciers are the most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and their loss in several centuries' time is likely to be followed by the collapse of the entire ice sheet. Coloured dots display meltwater hotspots from the continued ice loss.
[101]
Such warming-dependent, likely to be effectively irreversible changes are examples of
tipping points in the climate system
: in 2022, a major review had identified 16 likely tipping points, including three in Antarctica. The West Antarctic ice sheet is the most vulnerable of the three, as the review found that it would likely be committed to complete collapse (adding about 3.3 m (10 ft) to sea level rise
[102]
) at around 1.5 °C (2.7 °F). At best, its collapse may not become inevitable until 3 °C (5.4 °F), but at worst, it may have been already triggered after the warming passed 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) globally. Once triggered, its collapse would unfold over a period of about 2000 years, with the absolute minimum of 500 years, and a potential maximum of 13,000 years.
[103]
[104]
In East Antarctica, the most vulnerable areas of the ice sheet are the so-called subglacial basins, such as
Wilkes Basin
, which are likely to become committed to collapse around 3 °C (5.4 °F) of global warming: at best, their full collapse may require 6 °C (11 °F), yet at worst, 2 °C (3.6 °F) might be sufficient. Once the warming level is sufficient to commit these subglacial basins to collapse, it could take between 500 and 10,000 years for them to disappear, with the most likely timeline of 2000 years.
[103]
[104]
Total ice loss from losing the West Antarctic ice sheet and the East Antarctic subglacial basins would lead to around 6 to 12 meters (20 to 39 feet) of sea level rise.
[105]
Finally, only very high warming will commit the entire East Antartic ice sheet to collapse: the most likely level is 7.5 °C (13.5 °F), with a range between 5 °C (9.0 °F) and 10 °C (18 °F)), and it would take at least 10,000 years to disappear entirely.
[103]
[104]
Another estimate suggested that the loss of two-thirds of its volume may require at least 6 °C (11 °F) of warming.
[99]
Ozone depletion
Main article:
Ozone hole
Image of the largest
hole in the ozone layer
recorded, in September 2006
Scientists have studied the
ozone layer
in the
atmosphere
above Antarctica since the 1970s. In 1985, British scientists, working on data they had gathered at
Halley Research Station
on the
Brunt Ice Shelf
, discovered a large area of low
ozone
concentration over Antarctica.
[106]
[107]
The 'ozone hole' covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2006;
[108]
the longest-lasting event occurred in 2020.
[109]
The depletion is caused by the
emission
of
chlorofluorocarbons
and halons into the atmosphere, which causes ozone to break down into other gases.
[110]
The extreme cold conditions of Antarctica allow
polar stratospheric clouds
to form. The clouds act as
catalysts
for chemical reactions, which eventually lead to the destruction of ozone.
[111]
The 1987
Montreal Protocol
has restricted the emissions of ozone-depleting substances. The ozone hole above Antarctica is predicted to slowly disappear; by the 2060s, levels of ozone are expected to have returned to values last recorded in the 1980s.
[112]
The ozone depletion can cause a cooling of around 6 °C (11 °F) in the
stratosphere
. The cooling strengthens the
polar vortex
and so prevents the outflow of the cold air near the South Pole, which in turn cools the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet. The peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are then subjected to higher temperatures, which accelerate the melting of the ice.
[107]
Models suggest that ozone depletion and the enhanced polar vortex effect may also account for the period of increasing sea ice extent, lasting from when observation started in the late 1970s until 2014. Since then, the coverage of Antarctic sea ice has decreased rapidly.
[113]

Most species in Antarctica seem to be the descendants of species that lived there millions of years ago. As such, they must have survived multiple

isolated warmer areas
, such as those with
geothermal heat
or areas that remained ice-free throughout the colder climate.

[117]
Antarctic krill

schools
, is the
keystone species
of the
ecosystem
of the Southern Ocean, being an important food organism for whales, seals,
leopard seals
, fur seals,
squid
,
icefish
, and many bird species, such as penguins and
albatrosses
.
[118]
Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on
phytoplankton
. Antarctic sea life includes
penguins
,
blue whales
,
orcas
,
colossal squids
and
fur seals
.
[119]
The
Antarctic fur seal
was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its
pelt
by
seal hunters
from the United States and the United Kingdom.
[120]
Leopard seals are
apex predators
in the Antarctic ecosystem and migrate across the Southern Ocean in search of food.
[121]
There are approximately 40 bird species that breed on or close to Antarctica, including species of
petrels
,
penguins
,
cormorants
, and
gulls
. Various other bird species visit the ocean around Antarctica, including some that normally reside in the Arctic.
[122]
The
emperor penguin
is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica; it and the
Adélie penguin
breed farther south than any other penguin.
[119]
A
Census of Marine Life
by some 500 researchers during the
International Polar Year
was released in 2010. The research found that more than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000 km (7,456 mi). Large animals such as some
cetaceans
and birds make the round trip annually. Smaller forms of life, such as
sea cucumbers
and
free-swimming snails
also found in both polar oceans. Factors that may aid in their distribution include temperature differences between the deep ocean at the poles and the equator of no more than 5 °C (9 °F) and the major current systems or marine conveyor belts which are able to transport eggs and
larva
.
[123]
Fungi
An orange lichen (perhaps
Caloplaca
) growing on the

About 1,150 species of
fungi
have been recorded in the Antarctic region, of which about 750 are non-
lichen
-forming.
[124]
[125]
Some of the species, having evolved under extreme conditions, have
colonized structural cavities within porous rocks
and have contributed to shaping the rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges.
[126]
The simplified
morphology
of such fungi, along with their similar
biological structures
,
metabolism systems
capable of remaining active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles, make them well suited to such environments. Their thick-walled and strongly
melanised
cells make them resistant to
UV
radiation.
[126]
An Antarctic
endemic
species, the
crust-like
lichen
Buellia frigida
, has been used as a
model organism
in
astrobiology
research.
[127]
The same features can be observed in algae and
cyanobacteria
, suggesting that they are
adaptations
to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that
life on Mars
might have been similar to Antarctic fungi, such as
Cryomyces antarcticus
and
Cryomyces minteri
.
[126]
Some of the species of fungi, which are apparently endemic to Antarctica, live in bird dung, and have evolved so they can grow inside extremely cold dung, but can also pass through the intestines of warm-blooded animals.
[128]
[129]
Plants
Main article:
Flora of Antarctica
Further information:
Flora Antarctica
Throughout its history, Antarctica has seen a wide variety of plant life. In the
Cretaceous
, it was dominated by a fern-
conifer
ecosystem, which changed into a
temperate rainforest
by the end of that period. During the colder
Neogene
(17-2.5 Ma), a
tundra
ecosystem replaced the rainforests. The climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form.
[130]
A combination of freezing temperatures, poor
soil quality
, and a lack of moisture and sunlight inhibit plant growth, causing low
species diversity
and limited distribution. The
flora
largely consists of
bryophytes
(25 species of
liverworts
and 100 species of
mosses
). There are three species of
flowering plants
, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula:
Deschampsia antarctica
(Antarctic hair grass),
Colobanthus quitensis
(Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native
Poa annua
(annual bluegrass).
[131]
Other organisms
Of the 700 species of algae in Antarctica, around half are marine phytoplankton. Multicoloured
snow algae
are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.
[132]
Bacteria have been found as deep as 800 m (0.50 mi) under the ice.
[133]
It is thought to be likely that there exists a native bacterial community within the subterranean water body of Lake Vostok.
[134]
The existence of life there is thought to strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on
Jupiter
's moon
Europa
, which may have water beneath its water-ice crust.
[135]
There exists a community of
extremophile
bacteria in the highly
alkaline
waters of
Lake Untersee
.
[136]
[137]
The prevalence of highly resilient creatures in such inhospitable areas could further bolster the argument for
extraterrestrial life
in cold,
methane
-rich environments.

Conservation and environmental protection
Refuse littering the shoreline at
Bellingshausen Station

Island, photographed in 1992
A whale in the
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary
The
first international agreement to protect Antarctica's biodiversity
was adopted in 1964.
[139]
The
overfishing
of krill (an animal that plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem) led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The
Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
, an international treaty that came into force in 1980, regulates fisheries, aiming to preserve ecological relationships.
[1]
Despite these regulations,
illegal fishing
—particularly of the highly prized
Patagonian toothfish
which is marketed as Chilean sea bass in the U.S.—remains a problem.
[140]
In analogy to the 1980 treaty on
sustainable fishing
, countries led by New Zealand and the United States negotiated a treaty on mining. This
Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities
was adopted in 1988. After a strong campaign from environmental organisations, first Australia and then France decided not to ratify the treaty.
[141]
Instead, countries adopted the
Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
(the Madrid Protocol), which entered into force in 1998.
[142]
The Madrid Protocol bans all mining, designating the continent as a "natural reserve devoted to peace and science".
[143]
The pressure group
Greenpeace
established
a base on Ross Island
from 1987 to 1992 as part of its attempt to establish the continent as a
World Park
.
[144]
The
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary
was established in 1994 by the
International Whaling Commission
. It covers 50 million km
2
(19 million sq mi) and completely surrounds the Antarctic continent. All
commercial whaling
is banned in the zone, though Japan has continued to hunt whales in the area, ostensibly for research purposes.
[145]
Despite these protections, the biodiversity in Antarctica is still at risk from human activities.
Specially protected areas
cover less than 2% of the area and provide better protection for
animals with popular appeal
than for less visible animals.
[139]
There are more terrestrial protected areas than
marine protected areas
.
[146]
Ecosystems are impacted by local and global threats, notably
pollution
, the
invasion of non-native species
, and the various
effects of climate change
.

[147]
Cook came within about 120 km (75 mi) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of
field ice
in January 1773.
[148]
In 1775, he called the existence of a polar continent "probable," and in another copy of his
journal
he wrote: "[I] firmly believe it and it's more than probable that we have seen a part of it".
[149]
19th century
Adélie Land
, depicted by
Jules Dumont d'Urville
in his
Voyage au Pôle Sud
(1846)
Sealers
were among the earliest to go closer to the Antarctic landmass, perhaps in the earlier part of the 19th century. The oldest known human remains in the Antarctic region was a skull, dated from 1819 to 1825, that belonged to a young woman on
Yamana Beach
at the
South Shetland Islands
. The woman, who was likely to have been part of a
sealing
expedition, was found in 1985.
[150]
The first person to see Antarctica or its ice shelf was long thought to have been the British sailor
Edward Bransfield
, a captain in the
Royal Navy
, who discovered the tip of the Antarctic peninsula on 30 January 1820. However, a captain in the
Imperial Russian Navy
,
Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen
, recorded seeing an ice shelf on 27 January.
[151]
The American sealer
Nathaniel Palmer
, whose sealing ship was in the region at this time, may also have been the first to sight the Antarctic Peninsula.
[152]
The
First Russian Antarctic Expedition
, led by Bellingshausen and
Mikhail Lazarev
on the 985-ton
sloop-of-war
Vostok
and the 530-ton support vessel
Mirny
, reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) of
Queen Maud Land
and recorded sighting an ice shelf at
,
[153]
on 27 January 1820.
[154]
[note 4]
The sighting happened three days before Bransfield sighted the land of the
Trinity Peninsula
of Antarctica, as opposed to the ice of an ice shelf, and 10 months before Palmer did so in November 1820. The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer
John Davis
, apparently at
Hughes Bay
on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim, as there is no evidence Davis landed on the Antarctic continent rather than an offshore island.
[155]
[156]
On 22 January 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the
Balleny Islands
, some members of the crew of the 1837-1840 expedition of the French explorer
Jules Dumont d'Urville
disembarked on the
Dumoulin Islands
, off the coast of Adélie Land, where they took some mineral, algae, and animal samples erected the French flag and claimed French
sovereignty over the territory
.
[157]
The American captain
Charles Wilkes
led an expedition in 1838-1839 and was the first to claim he had discovered the continent.
[158]
The British naval officer
James Clark Ross
failed to realise that what he referred to as "the various patches of land recently discovered by the American, French and English navigators on the verge of the Antarctic Circle" were connected to form a single continent.
[159]
[160]
[161]

The American explorer
Mercator Cooper
landed on East Antarctica on 26 January 1853.

[note 6]
In the summer of 1996-1997, Norwegian explorer
Børge Ousland
became the first person to cross Antarctica alone from coast to coast, helped by a kite on parts of the journey.
[174]
Ousland holds the record for the fastest unsupported journey to the South Pole, taking 34 days.
[175]
Population
Main articles:
Demographics of Antarctica
and
Religion in Antarctica
The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the
Antarctic Convergence
) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on
South Georgia
, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of the island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion from Britain.
[176]
[note 7]
The "ceremonial"
South Pole
, at
Amundsen-Scott Station
Antarctica's population consists mostly of the staff of
research stations
in Antarctica (which are continuously maintained despite the population decline in the winter), although there are 2 all-civilian bases in Antarctica: the
Esperanza Base
and the
Villa Las Estrellas base
.
[177]
The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,200 in winter to about 4,800 in the summer, with an additional 136 people in the winter to 266 people in the summer from the 2 civilian bases (as of 2017). Some of the
research stations
are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. The
Russian Orthodox
Holy Trinity Church
at the
Bellingshausen Station
on
King George Island
opened in 2004; it is manned year-round by one or two
priests
, who are similarly rotated every year.
[178]
[179]
The first child born in the southern polar region was a Norwegian girl,
Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen
, born in
Grytviken
on 8 October 1913.
[180]
Emilio Marcos Palma
was the first person born south of the
60th parallel south
and the first to be born on the Antarctic mainland at the Esperanza Base of the Argentine Army.
[181]
The
Antarctic Treaty
prohibits any
military activity in Antarctica
, including the establishment of military bases and fortifications, military manoeuvres, and weapons testing. Military personnel or equipment are permitted only for scientific research or other peaceful purposes.
[182]
Operation 90
by the
Argentine military
in 1965 was conducted to strengthen Argentina's claim in Antarctica.

Politics
The U.S. delegate
Herman Phleger
signs the
Antarctic Treaty
in December 1959.
Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959
Antarctic Treaty
and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System.
[1]
The treaty was signed by twelve countries, including the
Soviet Union
, the United Kingdom, Argentina,
Chile
, Australia, and the United States. Since 1959, a further 42 countries have
acceded
to the treaty. Countries can participate in decision-making if they can demonstrate that they do significant research on Antarctica; as of 2022
, 29 countries have this 'consultative status'.
[184]
Decisions are based on
consensus
, instead of a
vote
. The treaty set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve and established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection.
[185]
Territorial claims
Main article:
Territorial claims in Antarctica
Map of the Spanish
Governorate of Terra Australis
(1539-1555), the first territorial claim over the lands near the South Pole; later it was incorporated into the
Governorate of Chile
.
In
1539
, the
King of Spain
,
Charles V
, created the
Governorate of Terra Australis
, which encompassed lands south of the
Strait of Magellan
and thus theoretically Antarctica,
[186]
granting this Governorate to
Pedro Sancho de la Hoz
,
[187]
[188]
who in 1540 transferred the title to the conquistador
Pedro de Valdivia
.
[189]
Spain claimed all the territories to the south of the Strait of Magellan until the
South Pole
, with eastern and western borders to these claims specified in the
Treaty of Tordesillas
and
Zaragoza
respectively. In 1555 the claim was incorporated to
Chile
.
[190]
In the present, sovereignty over regions of Antarctica is claimed by seven countries.
[1]
While a few of these countries have mutually recognised each other's claims,
[191]
the validity of the claims is not recognised universally.
[1]
New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959, although in 2015, Norway formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area between it and the South Pole.
[192]
The Argentine, British, and Chilean claims overlap and have caused friction. In 2012, after the British
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
designated a previously unnamed area
Queen Elizabeth Land
in tribute to
Queen Elizabeth II
's
Diamond Jubilee
,
[193]
the Argentine government protested against the claim.
[194]
The UK passed some of the areas it claimed to Australia and New Zealand after they achieved independence. The claims by Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, and Norway do not overlap and are recognised by each other.
[191]
Other member nations of the Antarctic Treaty do not recognize any claim, yet have shown some form of territorial interest in the past.
[195]
Brazil has a designated '
zone of interest
' that is not an actual claim.
[196]
Peru formally reserved its right to make a claim.
[195]
Russia inherited the Soviet Union's right to claim territory under the original Antarctic Treaty.
[197]
[

South Africa formally reserved its right to make a claim.

, and other minerals have been found in Antarctica, but not in large enough quantities to extract.
[198]
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which came into effect in 1998 and is due to be reviewed in 2048, restricts the exploitation of Antarctic resources, including minerals.
[199]
Tourists
have been
visiting Antarctica
since 1957.
[200]
Tourism is subject to the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol;
[201]
the self-regulatory body for the industry is the
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators
.
[202]
Tourists arrive by small or medium ship at specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife.
[200]
Over 74,000 tourists visited the region during the 2019-2020 season, of which 18,500 travelled on cruise ships but did not leave them to explore on land.
[203]
The numbers of tourists fell rapidly after the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic
. Some nature conservation groups have expressed concern over the potential adverse effects caused by the influx of visitors and have called for limits on the size of visiting
cruise ships
and a tourism quota.
[204]
The primary response by Antarctic Treaty parties has been to develop guidelines that set landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites.
[205]
Overland sightseeing flights operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the
Mount Erebus disaster
in 1979, when an
Air New Zealand
plane crashed into Mount Erebus, killing all of the 257 people on board.
Qantas
resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.
[206]
There are many
airports
in Antarctica.
Research
An aerial view of
McMurdo Station
, the largest
research station in Antarctica
In 2017, there were more than 4,400 scientists undertaking research in Antarctica, a number that fell to just over 1,100 in the winter.
[1]
There are over 70 permanent and seasonal research stations on the continent; the largest, United States'
McMurdo Station
, is capable of housing more than 1,000 people.
[207]
[208]
The
British Antarctic Survey
has five major research stations on Antarctica, one of which is completely portable. The Belgian
Princess Elisabeth station
is one of the most modern stations and the first to be
carbon-neutral
.
[209]
Argentina, Australia, Chile, and Russia also have a large scientific presence on Antarctica.
[1]
Geologists
primarily study
plate tectonics
,
meteorites
, and the breakup of Gondwana.
Glaciologists
study the history and dynamics of floating ice,
seasonal snow
, glaciers, and ice sheets.
Biologists
, in addition to researching wildlife, are interested in how low temperatures and the presence of humans affect adaptation and survival strategies in organisms.
[210]
Biomedical scientists
have made discoveries concerning the spreading of
viruses
and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures.
[211]
An Antarctic
meteorite
,
Allan Hills 84001
on display at the
Smithsonian Museum of Natural History
The high elevation of the interior, the low temperatures, and the length of polar nights during the winter months all allow for better
astronomical observations
at Antarctica than anywhere else on Earth. The view of space from Earth is improved by a thinner atmosphere at higher elevations and a lack of water vapour in the atmosphere caused by freezing temperatures.
[212]
Astrophysicists
at the
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
study
cosmic microwave background radiation
and
neutrinos
from space.
[213]
The largest
neutrino detector
in the world, the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory
, is at the Amundsen-Scott Station. It consists of around 5,500
digital optical modules
, some of which reach a depth of 2,450 m (8,040 ft), that are held in 1 km
3
(0.24 cu mi) of ice.
[214]
Antarctica provides a unique environment for the study of meteorites: the dry polar desert preserves them well, and meteorites older than a million years have been found. They are relatively easy to find, as the dark stone meteorites stand out in a landscape of ice and snow, and the flow of ice accumulates them in certain areas. The
Adelie Land meteorite
, discovered in 1912, was the first to be found. Meteorites contain clues about the composition of the
Solar System
and its early development.
[215]
Most meteorites come from asteroids, but a few meteorites found in Antarctica came from the Moon and Mars.

Businesswoman, politician, journalist
Michela Vittoria Brambilla
(born 26 October 1967) is an Italian politician, animal rights activist and businesswoman. On 12 May 2008 she was nominated undersecretary (Tourism) in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet; on 8 May 2009 she was appointed Minister of Culture and Tourism, a position held until 2011.
[2]
[3]
In 2007 she set up
The People of Freedom
, the goal of which was to merge the right-wing allies of Berlusconi. She is a current leader of the
Animalist Movement
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Heir of a family of steel manufacturers going back four generations, Brambilla received a degree in philosophy from the
Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore
. In 2006 she lost an election for the
Chamber of Deputies
, on the
Forza Italia
ticket. In 2007 she named herself president of the national association of the
Club of Freedom
, the political organisation she created, which has more than 6,000 clubs all around Italy.
Before entering politics she was a television journalist for Berlusconi's Mediaset group. She is the general executive manager of Trafilerie Brambilla spa, a steel manufacturing firm, and is president of two businesses with her father Vittorio: Sal Group spa and Sotra Coast International.
She rose quickly to national prominence in 2003 after having been named president of the under-40 entrepreneurs' council at Confcommercio. On 20 November 2006 she founded the Freedom Circles organisation and published the book titled
Tutte le tasse di
Prodi & C.
: una finanziaria contro gli italiani
.
[4]
She has worked very closely with Silvio Berlusconi, the president of the Forza Italia party.  Some observers (such as the magazine
Panorama
), name her as a possible successor to Berlusconi, as leader of the party and of the Italian
centre-right
. Brambilla has publicly denied such rumours.
In June 2007, through the Freedom Clubs organisation, Brambilla launched the satellite channel Freedom TV, featuring talks with experts, professionals and private citizens, often connected with her personal campaign against tax evasion.
Animal rights
[
edit
]
Brambilla is a
vegan
and advocate of
animal rights
.
[5]
[6]
She is the founder of the Italian League for the Defense of Animals and the Environment (LEIDAA).
[6]
In 2017, she formed the Animalist Movement, a political faction of
Forza Italia
to protect animal rights.

As characters defeat enemies they charge a skill meter, with the player activating the character's unique skill, both for the main character and others, when fully charged.

Motor vehicle and bicycle tube valve
Schrader valve components (from left to right) the valve core closed (top) and open (bottom), the order of assembly, end view of stem without core and with core (top) and stem with the dust cap on (bottom). The core has a short outer thread which is screwed into the inner thread of the stem. The visible outer thread of the stem holds the dust cap.
The
Schrader valve
(also called
American valve
[1]
) is a type of pneumatic tire valve used on virtually every motor vehicle in the world today. The Schrader company, for which it was named, was founded in 1844 by
August Schrader
. The original Schrader valve design was invented in 1891, and patented in the United States in 1893.
[2]
The Schrader valve consists of a
valve stem
into which a valve core is threaded. The valve core is a
poppet valve
assisted by a
spring
. A small rubber seal located on the core keeps the fluid from escaping through the threads. Using the appropriate tools, a faulty valve core can be immediately extracted from the valve stem and replaced with a new one.
Uses
[
edit
]
The Schrader valve is used on virtually all
automobile tires
and
motorcycle tires
and most wider-rimmed
bicycle tires
. In addition to tube and tubeless tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used on many
refrigeration
and
air conditioning
systems to allow servicing, including recharging with
refrigerant
; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a bleeding and test port on the fuel rail of some
fuel injected
engines
; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to the rider's weight; for medical gas outlets within hospitals and some medical vehicles; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of
SCUBA
systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on
aircraft
.
[3]
Many domestic
fire extinguishers
use an internal valve identical to a Schrader valve, but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurized content.
It is also the same thread specification used on the shutter button of some old Leica, Yashica, and also  Nikon F and F2 cameras.
Valve
[
edit
]
Long (old) version of the core
Short (modern) core being opened to allow air to escape
A Schrader valve consists of an externally threaded hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically nickel-plated
brass
. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin aligned with the long axis of the tube; the pin's end is approximately flush with the end of the valve body.
All Schrader valves used on tires have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all common applications. The core of the valve can be removed or tightened with a tool.
Industrial Schrader valves are available in different diameters and valve core variants and are used in refrigeration, propane, and a variety of other uses.
[4]
With the advent of miniature electronics, Schrader valve stems with integrated transmitters for
tire pressure monitoring systems
(TPMS) became available.
Cap
[
edit
]
A valve cap on a Schrader valve prevents the entry of contaminants that may interfere with the sealing surfaces and cause leakage.
Metal, and some hard plastic valve caps, have a rubber
washer
or
O-ring
inside, both to prevent the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibration. These caps also serve as a
mechanical seal
to prevent air from leaking from a faulty valve core. Simple caps without a seal do not reliably prevent leaks. Some metal caps are equipped with prongs to enable removing and replacing valve cores, thereby serving two functions: seal and emergency tool.
In refrigeration and air conditioning applications, the valve cap is considered to be the primary seal, with the Schrader valve only being used for service access.

Schrader versus other valve types

Schrader valve stem with valve core
There are three valves used on tires worldwide: Schrader valves,
Presta valves
, and
Dunlop valves
. Each goes by multiple names. Schrader valves are also known as American valves or car valves. Presta valves are also known as French valves, Sclaverand valves, and road bike valves. Dunlop valves are also known as German valves, English valves, Holland valves, Woods valves, flash valves, and alligator valves.
[7]
Schrader valves are almost universal on car, truck, and motorcycle tires worldwide. Presta and Dunlop valves are mostly found on bicycle tubes. Both the Schrader and the Presta types are effective for sealing high pressures. Their chief differences are that Schrader valves are larger and have springs that close the valve except when the pin is depressed. Schrader valves are used in a wide variety of compressed gas and pressurized liquid applications such as small torch and grill cylinders, and air shocks. Schrader valves are also viewed as more complex (requiring two seals over one). They weigh 4-5g more than Presta valves.
[8]
Schrader and Dunlop valve stems are 8 mm in diameter, whereas Presta valve stems are 6 mm, allowing Prestas to be used on narrower, high-performance rims as on road
racing bicycles
. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that debris may be introduced into its spring-loaded pin, impairing inflation, whereas the Presta valve relies only on air pressure and a small knurled nut to keep it shut.
Inflating a bicycle tire equipped with a Presta or Dunlop valve at an automobile
filling station
requires an adaptor, while a Schrader-valved tube does not. Inflating at home or on the road requires either 6mm air chuck for Presta and Dunlop valves, or an 8mm chuck for Schrader valves. An important advantage of Schrader valves relative to Presta is that Schrader valves allow for quick air pressure checks.
[9]
Some chucks have dual orifices to inflate all three.

Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy - Zliten
Location
Zliten
,
Libya
The
Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy - Zliten
(in
Arabic
: زليتن مدينة - الدستورية للشرعية العودة حراك) seeks to reinstate the 1951 Constitution of Libya, proclaiming it a symbol of the sovereignty of the nation and a guarantor of unity.
[2]
Zliten is one of the several cities within Libya that is actively involved in the larger movement, the
Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy in Libya
.
The Movement for the Return of Constitutional Legitimacy in Libya asserts that the internationally-recognized 1951 Constitution amended in 1963 established a legitimate and independent governing structure for the Libyan homeland and comprises the best solution for Libya’s future.
[2]
Advocates for the movement in Zliten state that “[Libya’s] Constitution is a national social charter approved by a constituent body representing all the spectrums of the Libyan people […] Allah bless our independence!”
[2]
Along with revival of the 1951 Constitution, the movement, particularly in Zliten, supports the restoration of the
Senussi
monarchy
with heir apparent Prince Mohammed El Senussi, son of Crown Prince
Hasan as-Senussi
and grandnephew of late
King Idris
, as its leader.
[2]
[3]
[4]
Support for the Zliten movement on social media
[
edit
]
The Zliten local movement has an active presence on social media, including 14,786 total “likes” and 14,741 followers on its
Facebook
page. Below is a selection of posts from its page:
“Political malice as the purity of the Founding Fathers who have placed it for us, not a commodity in the market of political impurity.”
[2]
“The Constitutional Kingdom of Libya achieved social reconciliation and transitional justice […] The Constitutional Kingdom of Libya preserved the sanctity of citizens […] The Constitutional Kingdom of Libya has achieved for its citizens an adequate standard of living.”
[2]
Local events
[
edit
]
The movement has hosted several events with hundreds of supporters in attendance focused on advocating for the restoration of the 1951 Libyan Constitution.
On December 24, 2015, the movement hosted an event in Zliten to celebrate the 64th anniversary of the Independence of Libya.
[5]
It hosted another event on February 17, 2016 for the adoption of the national anthem.
[6]
On December 24, 2016, the movement hosted a similar event in support of renewing the campaign to reclaim the deleted part of the national anthem. The details provided were:
[7]
“We call on the Libyan people to contribute to support this campaign aimed at restoring things to normal and a return to consider the leader of independence and founder of the state of modern Libya King The late Muhammad Idris al-Sanusi (may Allaah have mercy on him).”
Related international attention
[
edit
]
An article in support of reestablishing the 1951 Constitution was published in the
Washington, D.C.
-based
Middle East Institute
.
[8]
The article refers to the 1963 Constitution as “more than an olive branch” and states the following:
[8]
“Libyans will have no choice but to soon make some hard decisions. One such option is returning to the region-conscious 1963 constitution. An earlier constitution in 1951 had granted a great deal of authority to the regions […]The return to the 1963 constitution is gaining momentum in Libya, with several movements, ranging from royalists to pro-democracy activists, calling for an adoption of the constitution.”
A similar article was published in Australia by
The Australian
magazine, noting that:
[9]
“Libyan monarchists are now quietly resurfacing, amid calls to revive the unifying constitution of 1951. A spokesman for Prince Mohammed said he was “ready to return to Libya if the people demand it […] Monarchy still works in North Africa and the Middle East. The Arab leaders overthrown in 2011 were the heads of republics. The royal dynasties of
Morocco
and
Jordan
(another kingdom forged with British support) remain hugely popular while demonstrating a knack for moving with the times.”
The article also states that:
“A restoration of the Senussi dynasty might help to reunite the warring tribes. Even some militia commanders favour a return of the monarchy. The spiritual status of the Senussi chiefs (Idris described himself as a direct descendant of the Prophet) would offer a strong religious counterpoint to the brutal fundamentalism of Isis.”
Mohammed El Senussi
[
edit
]
Libyan royalists widely consider Prince Mohammed El Senussi, son of Crown Prince Hasan as-Senussi and grandnephew of late King Idris, to be the legitimate heir to the Senussi Crown of Libya.
The movement in Zliten has voiced its opinion that the natural solution to the
Libyan crisis
is to reinstate the 1951 Constitution (as amended in 1963) with Crown Prince Mohammed El Senussi as the legitimate leader. The Zliten movement promotes the Prince’s leadership on its Facebook page and frequently circulates articles and speeches from the Prince’s website.

1981 video game

Publisher(s)

Platform(s)

,
PLATO
Release
1981
Genre(s)
Programming
RobotWar
is a
programming game
written by
Silas Warner
.  This game, along with the companion program
RobotWrite
, was originally developed in the
TUTOR
programming language
on the
PLATO system
in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the
Apple II series
of computers and published by
Muse Software
in 1981. The premise is that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat
robots
. As the manual states, "The task set before you is: to program a robot, that no other robot can destroy!"
[1]
The main activity of the game is to write a
computer program
that operates a (simulated) robot. The player selects multiple robots which do battle in an arena until only one is left standing. The robots do not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever
programming
techniques to deduce velocity. There is no way for the player to actually take part in the battle.
Robot programming
[
edit
]
The robots' language is similar to
BASIC
. There are 34
registers
that can be used as variables or for the robots'
I/O
functions. An example program from the game manual is:
SCAN
  AIM + 5 TO AIM                    ; MOVE GUN
  AIM TO RADAR                      ; SEND RADAR PULSE
LOOP
  IF RADAR < 0 GOSUB FIRE           ; TEST RADAR
  GOTO SCAN
FIRE
  0 - RADAR TO SHOT                 ; FIRE THE GUN
  ENDSUB
The robot with this program sweeps its radar in a circle, firing off radar pulses, and when it detects another robot, fires a projectile set to explode at the correct distance as estimated by the radar pulse. This particular robot stands still throughout the entire battle, as it never assigns any number to its movement registers.
Reception
[
edit
]
Harry White reviewed
RobotWar
in
The Space Gamer
No. 45.
[2]
White commented that "
RobotWar
is worth [...] the price. And if you don't have an Apple, but do own some other brand of personal computer, just wait - there'll be a similar game for you soon. It has to happen."
[2]
In its first issue
Computer Gaming World
praised
RobotWar
'
s language as easy to learn,
[3]
and for several years hosted contests for robot programs.
[4]
In 1996, the magazine named it the 85th best game ever.
[5]
BYTE
also praised Battle Language and its potential for teaching programming, as well as the sophisticated editor and debugger, but noted that the language's slow performance caused robots to
sometimes behave in unexpected ways
.
[6]
In a 2020 interview,
Stewart Cheifet
, the host and producer of
Computer Chronicles
told ZDNET that RobotWar was one of his favorite games, telling them "you didn't fight and shoot, you programmed your robot, it was a battle between the software, the robot you designed, and the robot the other guy designed,...it was brilliant."

Modern English
(
ME
), sometimes called
New English
(
NE
)
[2]
as opposed to
Middle
and
Old English
, is the form of the
English language
that has been spoken since the
Great Vowel Shift
in
England
, which began in the late
14th century
and was completed by the
17th century
.
With some differences in vocabulary, texts which date from the early 17th century, such as the works of
William Shakespeare
and the
King James Bible
, are considered Modern English texts, or more specifically, they are referred to as texts which were written in
Early Modern English
or they are referred to as texts which were written in
Elizabethan
English. Through
colonization
, English was adopted in many regions of the world by the
British Empire
, such as
Anglo-America
, the
Indian subcontinent
,
Africa
,
Australia
and
New Zealand
.
Modern English has many
dialects
spoken in many countries throughout the world, sometimes collectively referred to as the
English-speaking world
. These dialects include (but are not limited to)
American
,
Australian
,
British
(containing
English English
,
Welsh English
and
Scottish English
),
Canadian
,
Caribbean
,
Hiberno-English
,
Indian
,
Sri Lankan
,
Pakistani
,
Nigerian
,
New Zealand
,
Philippine
,
Singaporean
, and
South African English
.
According to the
Ethnologue
, there are almost one billion speakers of English as a first or second language.
[3]
English is spoken as a first or a second language in many countries, with most native speakers being in the
United States
, the
United Kingdom
,
Australia
,
Canada
,
New Zealand
and
Ireland
; there are also large populations in
India
,
Pakistan
, the
Philippines
and
Southern Africa
. It "has more non-native speakers than any other language, is more widely dispersed around the world and is used for more purposes than any other language". Its large number of speakers, plus its worldwide presence, have made English a
common language
(lingua franca) "of the airlines, of the sea and shipping, of computer technology, of science and indeed of (global) communication generally".
[4]
Development
[
edit
]
Modern English evolved from
Early Modern English
which was used from the beginning of the
Tudor period
until the
Interregnum
and
Restoration
in England.
[5]
By the late 18th century, the
British Empire
had facilitated the spread of Modern English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. Modern English also facilitated worldwide international communication. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some newly created nations that had multiple
indigenous languages
opted to continue using Modern English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting one indigenous language above another.
[6]
[7]
Outline of changes
[
edit
]
The following is an outline of the major changes in Modern English compared to its previous form (Middle English), and also some major changes in English over the course of the 20th century. Note, however, that these are generalizations, and some of these may not be true for specific dialects:
Morphology
[
edit
]
"
like
", "same as", and "immediately" are used as
conjunctions
.
[8]
"
The
" becomes optional before certain combinations of
noun phrases
and
proper names
.
[8]
Pronouns
[
edit
]
Loss of distinction in most dialects between "
whom
" and "
who
" in favour of the latter.
[8]
The elevation of
singular they
to some formal registers.
[8]
Placement of frequency
adverbs
before
auxiliary verbs
.
[8]
Verbs
[
edit
]
Regularisation
of some
English irregular verbs
[8]
Revival of the present ("mandative")
English subjunctive
[8]
"Will" preferred to "shall"
to mark the
future tense
in the first person
[8]
Do-support
for the verb "have"
[8]
Increase in
multi-word verbs
[8]
Development of
auxiliary verbs
"wanna", "
gonna
", "gotta" in informal discourse.
[8]
Usage of
English progressive verbs
in certain present perfect and past perfect forms.
[8]
Phonology
[
edit
]
Up until the American-British split
(1600-1725), some major phonological changes in English included:
Initial cluster reductions
, like of /ɡn, kn/ into /n/: making
homophones
of gnat and nat, and not and knot.
The
meet-meat merger
in most dialects: making the words "meat", "threat" and "great" have three different vowels, although all three words once rhymed.
The
foot-strut split
: so that "cut" and "put", and "pudding" and "budding" no longer rhyme; and "putt" and "put" are no longer homophones.
The
lot-cloth split
: the vowel in words like "cloth" and "off" is pronounced with the vowel in "thought", as opposed to the vowel used in "lot".
After the
American-British split
, further changes to English phonology included:
Non-rhotic (/ɹ/-dropping) accents
develop in the
English of England
, Australasia, and South Africa.
Happy-tensing
: final
lax
[ɪ] becomes tense [i] in words like "happy"
.
Absent from some dialects.
Yod-dropping
: the
elision
of /j/ in certain consonant clusters, like those found in "chute", "rude", "blue", "chews", and "Zeus".
Wine-whine merger
from the reduction of /ʍ/ to /w/ in all national standard varieties of English, except Scottish and Irish.
In
North American
and Australasian English, /t, d/ are reduced to an alveolar tap between vowels, realised as [t̬] or [ɾ]
Cot-caught merger
the merger of /ɔ/ and /ɑ/ to /ɑ/ in some dialects of
General American
.
Syntax
[
edit
]
disuse of the
T-V distinction
(
thou
,
ye
). Contemporary Modern English usually retains only the formal second-person personal pronoun, "
you
" (ye), used in both formal and informal contexts.
use of auxiliary verbs becomes mandatory in
interrogative
sentences.
"less", rather than "fewer"
, is used for
countable nouns
.
[8]
For
English comparisons
, syntactic comparison (
more
) is preferred to analytic comparison (
-er
).
[8]
Usage of the
Saxon genitive
('s) has extended beyond human referents.
[8]
Alphabet
[
edit
]
See also:
Early Modern English § Orthography
Changes in alphabet and spelling were heavily influenced by the advent of printing and continental printing practices.
The letter
thorn
(þ), which began to be replaced by
th
as early as Middle English, finally fell into disuse. In Early Modern English printing, thorn was represented with the Latin
y
, which appeared similar to thorn in blackletter typeface
(𝖞)
. The last vestige of the letter was in
ligatures
of thorn, y
e
(thee), y
t
(that), y
u
(thou), which were still seen occasionally in the
King James Bible
of 1611 and in Shakespeare's folios.
The letters
i
and
j
, previously written as a single letter, began to be distinguished; likewise for
u
and
v
. This was a common development of the
Latin alphabet
during this period.
Consequently, Modern English came to use a purely
Latin alphabet of 26 letters
.

Who's the Boss?
is an American sitcom television series created by
Martin Cohan
and
Blake Hunter
, which aired on
ABC
from September 20, 1984, to April 25, 1992. Produced by Hunter-Cohan Productions in association with
Embassy Television
(later Embassy Communications and ELP Communications) and
Columbia Pictures Television
, the series stars
Tony Danza
as Tony Micelli, a former
Major League Baseball
athlete who strives to raise his daughter, Samantha Micelli (
Alyssa Milano
), outside of the hectic nature of
New York City
and relocates her to
Fairfield, Connecticut
, where he works as a live-in housekeeper for a beautiful single advertising executive named Angela Bower (
Judith Light
). The series' cast also includes
Katherine Helmond
as Angela's mother, Mona Robinson, and
Danny Pintauro
as Angela's young son, Jonathan Bower.
The show became one of the most popular sitcoms of the
1980s
. The series was nominated for more than 40 awards, including ten
Primetime Emmy Award
and five
Golden Globe Award
nominations, winning one of each. Also very successful in the ratings,
Who's the Boss?
ranked in the top ten in the final primetime ratings between 1985 and 1989, and has since continued in syndication worldwide.
Plot
[
edit
]
Widower Anthony Morton "Tony" Micelli is a former
Major League Baseball
player who was forced to retire due to a shoulder injury. Wanting to move out of
Brooklyn
to find a better environment for his daughter, Samantha, he takes a job in the upscale New York City suburb of
Fairfield, Connecticut
, as a live-in housekeeper for divorced advertising
executive
Angela Bower and her young son Jonathan. He and Samantha move into the Bower home. Also appearing is Angela's feisty, sexually progressive mother Mona Robinson, who dates all kinds of men, from college-age to silver-haired CEOs.
The title of the show refers to the role reversal of Tony and Angela. Angela is the breadwinner of the home, and Tony (although he is not her husband) stays at home and takes care of the household and provides guidance and support to the children, Samantha and Jonathan. It challenged contemporary stereotypes of young, Italian-American males as macho, boorish, and wholly ignorant of life outside of urban working-class neighborhoods. Tony was depicted as sensitive, intelligent, and domestic with an interest in intellectual pursuits, and yet still athletic and streetwise.
The easy-going, spontaneous Tony and the driven, self-controlled Angela are attracted to each other, though both are uncomfortable with the notion for much of the show's run. While there is playful banter and many hints of their feelings for each other, Tony and Angela do their best to avoid facing this aspect of their developing relationship and date other people. Angela has a steady romantic interest in Geoffrey Wells (
Robin Thomas
), while Tony has a variety of girlfriends who come and go, including Kathleen Sawyer (
Kate Vernon
) in seasons six and seven. In the meantime, however, they become best friends, relying on each other frequently for emotional support. In addition, Tony provides a male role model for Jonathan, while Angela and Mona give Samantha the womanly guidance she had been missing.
Keeping ties with Tony's and Samantha's Brooklyn roots is motherly former neighbor Mrs. Rossini (
Rhoda Gemignani
), who ends up becoming a thorn in Mona's side. Several other friends turn up a few times each season, sometimes in New York, sometimes in Connecticut.
Angela eventually strikes out on her own and opens her own ad firm in season three, while Tony decides to go back to school, enrolling in the same college that daughter Samantha would later attend. Samantha's best friend Bonnie (Shana Lane-Block) is a recurring character during these seasons, while romance comes into her life in the form of her boyfriend Jesse Nash (
Scott Bloom
) during her senior year of high school and into college.
At the start of season eight, Tony and Angela finally acknowledge their love for each other. However, the series does not end with the widely expected marriage but on a more ambiguous note. This was due primarily to concerns by the network that a marriage, representing a definitive ending, could hurt syndication. Tony Danza also vehemently opposed the marriage, saying it would contradict the original purpose of the show.

During the final season, Samantha finds a new love in Hank Thomopoulous (Curnal Achilles Aulisio) who became a full-time character in January 1992. A fellow college student, Hank was originally poised to enter a medical program, but soon decides to become a puppeteer. Sam and Hank marry after an engagement lasting a matter of weeks.

Background
[
edit
]
Who's the Boss?
was created by television producers and business partners
Martin Cohan
and
Blake Hunter
in 1983.
[1]
[2]
In early development, the series was titled
You're the Boss
, in reference to Angela employing Tony and the gender role reversal.
[3]
Before the fall 1984 premiere, the producers changed it to
Who's the Boss?
, an open ended title which hinted that any one of the leads could get their own way and be the "boss".
[3]
Unlike Danza, who had served as the Tony prototype from the beginning, Judith Light was one of many who auditioned for the role of Angela.
[4]
She was eventually cast based on her performance, which Hunter commented as "class [...]
Jean Harlow
type, or more of a
Meryl Streep
."
[4]
The character of Mona was initially created as an older sister to Angela, but as Cohan and Hunter struggled to handle the casting of the role, they decided on re-writing the role into "a free spirit with a quick tongue," who they envisioned Katherine Helmond to play.
[4]
Danny Pintauro and Alyssa Milano were also cast based on their auditions.
[4]
The series' pilot was shot in November 1983, a full 10 months before the show actually went on the air.
[3]
ABC originally was planning to put it on mid-season in January 1984, but due to creative differences
[
vague
]
between the producers and the network, the show was delayed until the next season. The show debuted on September 20, 1984, up against the debut of another sitcom, NBC's
The Cosby Show
.
In the fall of 1991, after seven years on its established Tuesday night slot,
Who's the Boss?
was moved to Saturday nights at 8:00 p.m. (against NBC's
The Golden Girls
), along with fellow long-running sitcom
Growing Pains
. In February 1992, ABC added the long-running
Perfect Strangers
and the new cartoon
Capitol Critters
to the night. It was promoted as the new
I Love Saturday Night
lineup, an equivalent to the hit Friday
TGIF
block.
Who's the Boss?
moved to 8:30 p.m., with
Capital Critters
as its lead-in. The
I Love Saturday Night
banner proved to be short-lived, folding on February 29, 1992;
Who's the Boss?
moved back into the Saturday 8/7c slot in early March.
The series's ratings dropped significantly in its new time slot, and the decision was made to end the series in the spring of 1992.
[5]
The hour-long series finale aired on Saturday, April 25, 1992, along with the finales for
Growing Pains
and
MacGyver
.
Who's the Boss?
reruns continued to air through the summer.
[5]
Influence
[
edit
]
Critical reception
[
edit
]
Early reviews of the series were lukewarm. Jerry Buck, writing for
Ocala Star-Banner
, noted that while the series "doesn't have the same impact [as
The Cosby Show
], it's not bad, either." He compared Danza and Light's on-screen chemistry to
Katharine Hepburn
and
Spencer Tracy
.
[6]
The Pittsburgh Press
criticized that "the show may have a universal theme [but] it's hard to find," while Duane Dudek of
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
summed the series as a "pleasant little sitcom" which was not a "struggle for mastery [but] in some ways, a rather old-fashioned love story."
[7]
John J. O'Connor of
The New York Times
was complimentary of the female leads, Light and Helmond, but was concerned if Danza, who "spends a good deal of time with his shirt off and his thick weight-lifted physique" would "keep this sitcom in ratings shape."
[8]
Awards and nominations
[
edit
]
Who's the Boss?
was nominated for more than forty awards, including ten
Primetime Emmy Award
and five
Golden Globe Award
nominations, winning one each;
[9]
Katherine Helmond
received the 1989
Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Series, Miniseries or Television Film
, while
Mark J. Levin
was awarded the 1989
Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Direction for a Comedy Series
for his work on the episode "Two on a Billboard."
[9]
Frequently nominated at the annual
Young Artist Awards
, Milano earned three awards for her portrayal of Samantha.
[9]
Danny Pintauro and recurring guest
Scott Bloom
received one award each.
[9]
Theme song
[
edit
]
The show's theme song, "Brand New Life", was written by series creators and executive producers Cohan and Hunter, with music composed by
Larry Carlton
and
Robert Kraft
. Three versions were used throughout the series' run, which were performed by
Larry Weiss
(1984-86),
Steve Wariner
(1986-90), and
Jonathan Wolff
(1990-92).
[10]
[11]
The third version was first used for the last eight episodes of season six, and a very minor revision of that particular version of the theme was used during seasons seven and eight.
The first line of the theme song was changed from "There is more to life than what you're living" to "There's a time for love and a time for living" in season three onwards.

The remaining seven seasons have yet to be released due to copyright issues.
Spin-offs
[
edit
]
The first attempted
Who's the Boss?
spin-off had its origins in the second to final episode of season two, "Charmed Lives", a
backdoor pilot
for a program about two women up for the same job as well as overall being a series about the lives of single career women in the '80s. Starring
Fran Drescher
and
Donna Dixon
, it was not picked up as a series.
In 1987, producers had planned a spin-off entitled
Mona
, which focused on Mona's character leaving Angela to help her brother Cornelius run a seedy hotel in
Manhattan
.
[23]
The third season featured this plot in a two-part episode, but when ABC changed their mind about the spinoff, fearing what Mona's departure could mean to the show, the ending was rewritten to feature Mona returning to Angela's home.
[24]
The third attempted spin-off, which did make it to series, was titled
Living Dolls
. Premiering and ending in 1989, the show starred
Leah Remini
,
Michael Learned
, and
Halle Berry
. The show featured Remini, who had appeared in two
Who's the Boss
? episodes as a friend of Samantha's, as a homeless model taken under the wing of an agent played by Learned. In those same
Who's the Boss?
episodes,
Jonathan Ward
played Learned's son Rick; in the
Living Dolls
series,
David Moscow
took over the role.
Reboot/sequel series
[
edit
]
In August 2020, a revival/sequel of the series was announced.
[25]
It is slated to premiere on
Amazon Freevee
.
[26]
International versions
[
edit
]
Several versions of
Who's the Boss?
have been produced for foreign television markets. Some are dubbed and others are remakes. In many cases the names of the lead characters were changed:
Aired in India,
Samne wali khidki
starred
Archana Puran Singh
as Sanjana and
Akshay Anand
as Rohit. Here, the housekeeper was a struggling actor living as paying guest who has a niece who is the same age as Sanjana's son. There is no sexual tension between Rohit and Sanjana, although she is a divorcee and is hit upon by her neighbor, retired Army man Kukreja
Bharat Kapoor
and various recurring guest stars.
Aired in France starting 1987, first on Antenne 2 (now
France 2
), then on
M6
. The show was renamed
Madame est servie
("Dinner is served", but literally "Madam is served", referring to Tony being Angela's housekeeper). When the entire series aired in Canada on
Radio-Canada
, only the pilot intro was used (with shots of the van going around the block after leaving Tony's apartment, and a shot of Samantha and Tony in the van).
In Italy, the first two seasons were aired in 1989 on minor network
Odeon TV
as
Casalingo Superpiù
(
Super Housekeeper
); Katherine Helmond's character name was changed from Mona to Moira because in Italian, "mona" has a sexual reference.
In the United Kingdom,
The Upper Hand
aired on
ITV
from 1990 to 1996 while the original
Who's The Boss?
was screened on the individual ITV regional stations. The show starred
Joe McGann
,
Diana Weston
, and
Honor Blackman
in the roles originally played by Tony Danza, Judith Light and Katherine Helmond respectively. In 1993, Helmond herself appeared in an episode of this version as Madame Alexandra.
[27]
Though the show had been broadcast in Germany in a dubbed version as
Wer ist hier der Boss?
(
Who is the Boss Here?
) since 1992 on
RTL Television
, a year later, the channel produced 15 early episodes with a German cast. The show was called
Ein Job fürs Leben
(
A Life's Job
). Tony was renamed Vito, an Italian
guest worker
from
Berlin-Neukölln
and former striker of soccer club
Hertha BSC
. Angela Bower was renamed Barbara Hoffmann. Their home was located in
Hamburg
's upscale suburb Othmarschen. Despite these little changes, the original scripts were used for shooting, and even the stage set was an almost identical replica of the original American set, with only minor details changed, such as paintings and bric-a-brac in German style. RTL Television gave the same treatment to
Married... with Children
under the title
Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt
(
Help! My family is nuts!
) with 26 episodes.
[28]
The two shows shared the first hour on Thursdays in the prime time slot from 8:15 pm to 10:15 pm.
A Spanish-language version, produced in Mexico by
TV Azteca
and
Columbia TriStar International Television
, debuted in 1998 under the title
Una familia con Ángel
(
A Family with Angel
) starring
Laura Luz
and Daniel Martínez. It was broadcast in the U.S. on the
Telemundo
network.
In Brazil,
Rede Bandeirantes
produced with
Columbia TriStar International Television
a Portuguese-language version of the show called
Santo de Casa
(
House Saint
), starring
Daniel Boaventura
, Regina Remencius and
Ana Lúcia Torre
. This version debuted in 1999.
[29]
In 2005, the Argentinian network
Telefé
also made its own local version called
¿Quién es el Jefe?
(
Who is the Boss?
), a direct translation of the original American title. It starred
Nicolás Vázquez
,
Gianella Neyra
and
Carmen Barbieri
in the adult roles.
In 2006, a Russian remake premiered that was titled
Kto v dome khozyain?
(which translates as "Who is the head in this house?"). It ran for 2 years on
CTC
. It starred Anna Nevskaya (as Daria, the boss) and Andrey Noskov (as Nikita, the housekeeper).
[30]
In 2006, Colombian network
Caracol TV
produced
¿Quién manda a quién?
(which was the title of the original show when dubbed in Spanish).
A Polish version,
I kto tu rządzi
?
(
And Who is in Charge Here?
), debuted in 2007 on
Polsat
, starring
Małgorzata Foremniak
and
Bogusław Linda
.
In Turkey, it is aired as
Patron Kim?
(
Who is the Boss?
) on
ATV Turkey
.

for a period of time in the 1900s.
History
[

Kranji railway station
was opened to the public on an unknown date as an infill station between
Woodlands station
and
Bukit Panjang station
to serve the
Kranji
area.
As it was decided that Tank Road station was unfit to be the terminus of the line, it was decided that the Bukit Timah-Tank Road section of the line would be abandoned, and the line would instead deviate in between Bukit Panjang station and Bukit Timah station, travelling down a different route which ran along the west of the main town, to a new terminal station at
Tanjong Pagar
,
[1]
with a new station being built at Bukit Timah, and two new stations at
Tanglin
and
Alexandra
.
[2]
In November 1955, a new service was introduced in which lorries would arrive at the station in the morning and in the evening to bring people to and fro from work from the station. This was introduced due to the low ridership of the station.
[3]
[4]
By 1984 the station had already been abandoned and demolished. The site of the former station was one of several possible locations for a railbus station for the railbus line that the
Keretapi Tanah Melayu
(KTM) planned to build in Singapore.

Transfer of a dominant language to other people as a demonstration of power
For the book by Robert Phillipson, see
Linguistic Imperialism
. For broader coverage of this topic, see
Cultural imperialism
.
Linguistic imperialism
or
language imperialism
is occasionally defined as "the transfer of a dominant
language
to other people". This language "transfer" (or rather unilateral imposition) comes about because of
imperialism
. The transfer is considered to be a sign of
power
; traditionally
military power
but also, in the modern world,
economic power
. Aspects of the dominant
culture
are usually
transferred
along with the language. In spatial terms,
indigenous languages
are employed in the function of
official (state) languages
in
Eurasia
, while only non-indigenous imperial (European) languages in the "Rest of the World".
[1]
In the modern world, linguistic imperialism may also be considered in the context of international development, affecting the standard by which organizations like the
International Monetary Fund
and the
World Bank
evaluate the trustworthiness and value of structural adjustment loans.
[2]
[
clarification needed
]
Since the early 1990s, linguistic imperialism has attracted attention among scholars of
applied linguistics
. In particular,
Robert Phillipson
's 1992 book,
Linguistic Imperialism
, has led to considerable debate about its merits and shortcomings. Phillipson found denunciations of linguistic imperialism that dated back to
Nazi
critiques of the
British Council
[3]
(European aristocracy was, at the time, agreeing on the use of English), and to
Soviet
analyses of
English
as the language of world
capitalism
and
world domination
.
[4]
In this vein, criticism of English as a world language is often rooted in
anti-globalism
.
Definition
[
edit
]
Linguistic imperialism is a form of
linguicism
which benefits and grants power to the dominating/oppressing language and its speakers. As summarized by linguists
Heath Rose
and
John Conama
, Dr. Phillipson argues that the defining characteristics of linguistic imperialism are:
[5]
[6]
As a form of linguicism, which manifests in favoring the dominant language over another along similar lines as
racism
and
sexism
.
As a structurally manifested idea, where more resources and infrastructure are given to the dominant language
As being ideological, in that it encourages beliefs that the dominant language form is more prestigious than others. These ideas are hegemonic and internalized and
naturalized
as being "normal".
As intertwined with the same structure as imperialism in culture, education, media, and politics.
As having an exploitative essence, which causes
injustice
and inequality between those who use the dominant language and those who do not.
As having a subtractive influence on other languages, in that learning the dominant language is at the expense of others.
As being contested and resisted, because of these factors.
Although it is not easy to determine the intentions of specific policies which have led to linguicism, some scholars believe that intent can be proven by observing whether imperialist practices are continued once their
sociolinguistic
, sociological, psychological, political, and educational harm of other languages are made aware.

History
[
edit
]
The impacts of colonization on linguistic traditions vary based on the form of colonization experienced: trader, settler or exploitation.
[10]
Congolese-American linguist
Salikoko Mufwene
describes trader colonization as one of the earliest forms of European colonization. In regions such as the western coast of Africa as well as the Americas, trade relations between European colonizers and indigenous peoples led to the development of
pidgin languages
.
[10]
Some of these languages, such as Delaware Pidgin and
Mobilian Jargon
, were based on Native American languages, while others, such as
Nigerian Pidgin
and
Cameroonian Pidgin
, were based on European ones.
[11]
As trader colonization proceeded mainly via these hybrid languages, rather than the languages of the colonizers, scholars like Mufwene contend that it posed little threat to indigenous languages.
[11]
A photo of students at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School
Trader colonization was often followed by settler colonization, where European colonizers settled in these colonies to build new homes.
[10]
Hamel, a Mexican linguist, argues that "segregation" and "integration" were two primary ways through which settler colonists engaged with aboriginal cultures.
[12]
In countries such as Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, and those in the
Caribbean
, segregation and genocide decimated indigenous societies.
[12]
Widespread death due to war and illness caused many indigenous populations to lose their
indigenous languages
.
[10]
In contrast, in countries that pursued policies of "integration", such as Mexico,
Guatemala
and the
Andean states
, indigenous cultures were lost as aboriginal tribes mixed with colonists.
[12]
In these countries, the establishment of new European orders led to the adoption of colonial languages in governance and industry.
[10]
In addition, European colonists also viewed the dissolution of indigenous societies and traditions as necessary for the development of a unified
nation state
.
[12]
This led to efforts to destroy tribal languages and cultures: in Canada and the United States, for example, Native children were sent to boarding schools such as Col. Richard Pratt's
Carlisle Indian Industrial School
.
[10]
[13]
Today, in countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, which were once settler colonies, indigenous languages are spoken by only a small minority of the populace.
Portrait of Lord Macaulay
Mufwene also draws a distinction between settler colonies and exploitation colonies. In the latter, the process of colonization was focused on the extraction of raw materials needed in Europe.
[10]
As a result, Europeans were less invested in their exploitation colonies, and few colonists planned to build homes in these colonies. As a result, indigenous languages were able to survive to a greater extent in these colonies compared to settler colonies.
[10]
In exploitation colonies, colonial languages were often only taught to a small local elite. During the period of
British rule in India
, for example,
Lord Macaulay
highlighted the need for "...
a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions who govern... a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in my opinion, in morals and in intellect" in his now-famous "Macaulay minutes", which were written in support of the
English Education Act of 1835
.
[14]
The linguistic differences between the local elite and other locals exacerbated class stratification, and also increased inequality in access to education, industry and civic society in postcolonial states.

(
August 2015
)
In
Linguistic Imperialism
, Robert Henry Phillipson defines English linguistic imperialism as "the dominance of English... asserted and maintained by the establishment and continuous reconstitution of structural and cultural inequalities  between English and other languages."
[15]
English is often called a worldwide "
lingua franca
", but Phillipson argues that when its dominance leads to a
linguicide
, it can be more aptly titled a "lingua
frankensteinia
"
[
vague
]
by his view.
[16]
Phillipson's theory supports the historic spread of English as an international language and that language's continued dominance, particularly in
postcolonial
settings such as Wales, Scotland, Ireland, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Zimbabwe, etc., but also increasingly in "
neo-colonial
" settings such as continental
Europe
. His theory draws mainly on
Johan Galtung
's
imperialism
theory,
Antonio Gramsci
's theory, and in particular on his notion of
cultural hegemony
.
[16]
A central theme of Phillipson's theory is the complex hegemonic processes
[
clarification needed
]
which, he asserts, continue to sustain the pre-eminence of English in the world today. His book analyzes the
British Council
's use of rhetoric to promote English, and discusses key tenets of English
applied linguistics
and English-language-teaching methodology. These tenets hold that:
English is best taught
monolingually
("the monolingual fallacy");
the ideal teacher is a
native speaker
("the native-speaker fallacy");
[
clarification needed
]
the earlier English is taught, the better the results ("the early-start fallacy");
[
clarification needed
]
the more English is taught, the better the results ("the maximum-exposure fallacy");
[
clarification needed
]
if other languages are used much, standards of English will drop ("the subtractive fallacy").
[16]
According to Phillipson, those who promote English—organizations such as the British Council, the
IMF
and the
World Bank
, and individuals such as operators of English-language schools—use three types of argument:
Intrinsic
arguments describe the English language as "providential", "rich", "noble" and "interesting". Such arguments tend to assert what English
is
and what other languages
are not
.
Extrinsic
arguments point out that English is well-established: that it has many speakers, and that there are trained teachers and a wealth of teaching material.
Functional
arguments emphasize the usefulness of English as a gateway to the world.
[16]
Other arguments for English are:
its economic utility: it enables people to get access to some technologies
its ideological function: it is said as standing for modernity;
its status might be seen as symbol for material advance and efficiency.
[16]
Another theme in Phillipson's work is "linguicism"—the kind of
prejudice
which can lead to
endangered languages
becoming extinct or losing their local eminence due to the rise and competing prominence of English.
[16]
Other languages
[
edit
]
At various times, especially in colonial settings or where a dominant culture has sought to unify a region under its control, a similar phenomenon has arisen. In the
Roman Empire
,
Latin
—originally the language of a limited region in central Italy—was imposed first on the rest of Italy and later on parts of Europe, largely displacing local languages, while in
Roman Africa
Latin was dominant only until it and the native languages were displaced by
Arabization
.
Anatolia
had similar linguistic diversity when it was ruled by small native states.  Under the
Persian
and
Hellenistic empires
, the tongue of the conqueror served as the
lingua franca
. The indigenous
Anatolian languages
disappeared.
In the Far East, Africa and the Americas, regional languages have been or are being coercively replaced or slighted—
Tibetan
and regional Chinese varieties by
Mandarin Chinese
,
Ainu
and
Ryukyuan
by Japanese,
Quechua
and
Mesoamerican languages
by Spanish,
Malayo-Polynesian languages
by
Malay
(incl.
Indonesian
),
Philippine languages
by
Filipino
and so on. Arabization has eliminated many indigenous Berber languages in North Africa and restricted
Coptic
to use as a
liturgical language
by
Coptic Christian Orthodox
and
Coptic Catholic Churches
.
The English language during the Middle Ages was an object of linguistic imperialism by the French language, particularly following the
Norman conquest
. For hundreds of years, French or
Anglo-Norman
was the language of administration (
See
Law French
) and therefore a language of higher status in England. Latin remained the tongue of church and learning. Although many words introduced by the Normans are today indistinguishable by most English-speakers from native Germanic words, later-learned
loanwords
, copied from Latin or French may "sound more cultured" to a native English-speaker.
Following the establishment of the
Holy Roman Empire
over much of present-day Germany and Central Europe, the German language and its dialects became the preferred language of many Central-European nobility. With varying success, German spread across much of Central and Eastern Europe as a language of trade and status. This ended with World War II (
See also
Germanization
.
).
French has also expanded. Languages such as
Occitan
,
Breton
,
Basque
,
Catalan
and
Corsican
have been slighted in France. This process, known as
Francization
, often causes resistance amongst minority peoples, leading to demands for independence. Examples of this can still be found in
Breton nationalism
and in the
Flanders' Flemish Movement
in Belgium).
In Italy there is a situation similar to the French one, with Italian that has expanded at the expense of languages such as
Sardinian
,
Sicilian
,
Ladin
,
Venetian
and
Friulan
, while languages such as German (in
South Tyrol
) or French (in
Aosta Valley
), historically persecuted, are now co-official in those regions (
See also
Italianization
).
Warrant for the urgent removal of Basque language inscriptions from tombstones in
Gernika
and its substitution for Spanish (1949), according to ordinance
Portuguese and Spanish colonization made these languages prevalent in South America and in parts of Africa and Asia (the
Philippines
,
Macau
, and for a short time
Formosa
).  In Spain, Spanish spread and was imposed over other languages, becoming the only official language of the state from the 18th to the 20th century. It was labelled "the companion of the Empire" by
Antonio de Nebrija
(1492) in the introduction to his
Gramática de la lengua castellana
.
Russian linguistic imperialism can be seen in
Belarus
both in the former dispute over
the name of the country
(Belarus vs Belorussia) and in the common spelling of the name of their president. The English transcription of his name is the Russian form,
Alexander Lukashenko
, instead of the Belarusian form, Alyaksandr Lukashenka.
In post-independence
India
, there were attempts to make
Hindi
as the sole official language which was vehemently opposed by various provinces, particularly by the state of
Tamil Nadu
. In
Karnataka
, linguistic imperialism manifests as pushes to impose
Kannada
almost everywhere.

Criticism
[
edit
]
Many scholars have participated in lively discussions of Phillipson's claims. Alan Davies, for instance, envisions the ghost of Phillipson haunting the Department of Applied Linguistics in Edinburgh:
'Round up the usual suspects', he cries, outing those who have pretended all these years merely to teach applied linguistics, but who have really been plotting with the British Council to take over the world.
[18]
For Davies, two cultures inhabit linguistic imperialism: one, a culture of
guilt
("colonies should never have happened"); the other, that of romantic despair ("we shouldn't be doing what we are doing"). Rajagopalan goes a step farther and maintains that Phillipson's book has led to a guilt complex among
English language learning and teaching
(ELT) professionals.
[19]
Davies also argues that Phillipson's claims are not
falsifiable
: what "if the dominated... wanted to adopt English and continue to want to keep it? Phillipson's unfalsifiable answer must be that they don't, they can't, they've been persuaded against their better interests."
[20]
It has thus been argued that Phillipson's theory is patronizing in its implication that developing countries lack independent decision-making capacity (to adopt or not to adopt ELT). In the context of
Nigeria
, Bisong holds that people in the "
periphery
" use English pragmatically—they send their children to English-language schools precisely because they want them to grow up multilingual. Regarding Phillipson, Bisong maintains that "to interpret such actions as emanating from people who are victims of Centre linguistic imperialism is to bend sociolinguistic evidence to suit a preconceived thesis".
[21]
If English should be abolished because it is foreign, Bisong argues, then Nigeria itself would also have to be dissolved, because it was conceived as a colonial structure.
Furthermore, the assumption that the English language itself is imperialistic has come under attack.
Henry Widdowson
has argued that "there is a fundamental contradiction in the idea that the language of itself exerts hegemonic control: namely that if this were the case, you would never be able to challenge such control".
[22]
Additionally, the idea that the promotion of English necessarily implies a demotion of local languages has been challenged. Holborrow points out that "not all Englishes in the centre dominate, nor are all speakers in the
periphery
equally discriminated against".
[23]
Hiberno-English
or
New Zealand English
or even
England's regional dialects
such as
Cornish English
, for instance, could be regarded as a non-dominant centre variety of English.
Some scholars believe that English's dominance is not due to specific language policies, but rather as a side-effect of the spread of English-speaking colonists through colonization and globalization.
[24]
[25]
Thus it could be argued that, while those who follow Phillipson see choices about language as externally imposed, the other camp sees them as personal choices.
[26]
Response
[
edit
]
Those who support the arguments favoring the existence of linguistic imperialism claim that arguments against it are often advanced by
monolingual
native-speakers of English who may see the current status of English as a fact worthy of celebration.
[
citation needed
]
Those who see the increasing spread of English in the world as a worrying development (which lowers the status of local and regional languages as well as potentially undermining or eroding cultural values) are likely to be more receptive to Phillipson's views.
Alastair Pennycook
,
Suresh Canagarajah
,
Adrian Holliday
and
Julian Edge
fall into this group and are described as
critical applied linguists
.
However,
Henry Widdowson
’s remarks on
critical discourse analysis
may also be applied to the critical applied linguists:
It ought surely to be possible to say that an argument is confused, or an analysis flawed, without denying the justice of the cause they support. My view would be that if a case is just then we should look for ways of supporting it by coherent argument... And I would indeed argue that to do otherwise is to do a disservice to the cause. For the procedures of ideological exposure by expedient analysis... can, of course be taken up to further any cause, right wing as well as left.... If you have the conviction and commitment, you will always find your witch.
[27]
In
Ireland
, the issue of de-anglicising the influence of English has been a topic of debate in the country even before
independence
.
[28]
[29]
An argument for de-anglicisation was delivered before the Irish National Literary Society in Dublin, 25 November 1892; "When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the
English people
, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English."
[28]
According to
Ghil'ad Zuckermann
, "Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define
Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance."
[30]
Appropriation
[
edit
]
Some who reject the idea of linguistic imperialism argue that the global spread of English is better understood in the framework of
appropriation
[31]
—that English is used around the world
for local purposes
.  In addition to the example of Nigeria, other examples have been given:
Demonstrators in non-English-speaking countries often use signs in English to convey their demands to TV audiences around the world. In some cases, demonstrators may not understand what their signs say.

includes lessons such as "Pakistan, My Country", "Our Flag," and "Our Great Leader",
[35]
which might sound
jingoistic
to western ears. Within the native culture, however, establishing a connection between ELT, patriotism and the
Muslim
faith is seen as an aim of ELT, as the chairman of the Punjab Textbook Board openly states: "The board... takes care, through these books to inoculate in the students a love of the Islamic values and awareness to guard the ideological frontiers of your [the student's] home lands."
[36]
Such an "internationalization" of English may also offer new possibilities to English native-speakers. McCabe elaborates:
...whereas for two centuries we exported our language and our customs in hot pursuit of... fresh markets, we now find that our language and our customs are returned to us but altered so that they can be used by others... so that our own language and culture discover new possibilities, fresh contradictions.

. She graduated from
University of Baghdad
in 1980 and got her PhD in the field of
Microbiology
and
Cytology
from
the University of Reading
. Rikabi studied in the Universities of
Basra
, Mostanseria, and Baghdad for years. Then, she started publishing her poems in 2013 and had anthologies of poems, which impressed authors and critics inside and outside her country as a prominent poet.

Biography
[
edit
]
Sejal Abdulwahab Rikabi was born in Karbala where she finished primary and preparatory schools and grew up in Baghdad. She got her PhD in the field of sciences from Britain in 1980.  After that, she returned to her homeland, taught and did research at the university. At
the University of Reading
, she studied
Microbiology
and
Cytology
, and her major was in the field of
Cellular biology
. Afterwards, she worked at the University of Baghdad, and she was chosen as the assisting cultural consultant in
Australia
from 1981 until 1986 then at the
University of Mostanseria
in
Basra
from 2007 to 2010, she worked as an emeritus professor at the
University of Southern Queensland
.
[3]

[5]
Literature career
[
edit
]
Rikabi is a member of many scientific associations, as well as, the international writers union. During her educational years, she met many great
Arab
and non- Arab poets. She started publishing in 2013, and throughout the decade of 2010, she published her anthologies of poems “An Iraqi woman’s enchants”, that included over 77 poetic enchants, “Towards the Palm Orchard” that included over 91 prose texts, “The Moon never came out”. Furthermore, she participated with Arab poets in two anthologies of poems. Due to the influence of nature upon her, she wrote some English glimpses, similarly some of her poems were translated in
English
and
Kurdi
.
[6]
In addition, she had certain interest in nature and the beauty of its symbolism that let it a path towards the nature of passion about existence. According to the critic, Ismaiel Ibraheem Abdou, she managed to set herself among the list of the major keys of writing that exceeds beyond her skies, lands and dreams. Since both individual and collective,
[7]
alongside her passion about her poetic creations, the poet attracted our thoughts with her poems aiming at making a special impact throughout her artwork production, especially her pursuit after it
7
. Further, she was described as “Creation, the universe, the awareness, being overwhelmed by the upcoming, restoring situations of yesterday and today and what might be attached thereto towards tomorrow,
[8]
and she mixed the reality with the
romanticism
”.
[9]
Rikabi recited one of her poems for
City of Bagdad
, a
UNESCO
city of literature, for
World Poetry Day
2019.

Non-tangible executable component of a computer
For other uses, see
Software (disambiguation)
.
A diagram showing how the
user
interacts with
application software
on a typical
desktop computer
. The application software layer interfaces with the
operating system
, which in turn communicates with the
hardware
. The arrows indicate information flow.
Software
is a set of
computer programs
and associated
documentation
and
data
.
[1]
This is in contrast to
hardware
, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.
At the
lowest programming level
,
executable code
consists of
machine language
instructions supported by an individual
processor
—typically a
central processing unit
(CPU) or a
graphics processing unit
(GPU). Machine language consists of groups of
binary values
signifying
processor instructions
that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction
may also invoke
one of many
input or output operations
, for example, displaying some text on a computer screen, causing state changes that should be visible to the
user
. The processor
executes
the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to
"jump" to a different instruction
or is
interrupted
by the operating system. As of 2023
, most
personal computers
,
smartphone
devices, and
servers
have
processors with multiple execution units
, or
multiple processors performing computation
together, so computing has become a much more
concurrent
activity than in the past.
The majority of software is written in
high-level programming languages
. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to
natural languages
than machine languages.
[2]
High-level languages are translated into machine language using a
compiler
, an
interpreter
, or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level
assembly language
that has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.
History
Main article:
History of software
An
algorithm
for what would have been the first piece of software was written by
Ada Lovelace
in the 19th century, for the planned
Analytical Engine
.
[3]
She created
proofs
to show how the engine would calculate
Bernoulli numbers
.
[3]
Because of the proofs and the algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer.
[4]
[5]
The first theory about software, prior to the creation of computers as we know them today, was proposed by
Alan Turing
in his 1936 essay,
On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
Entscheidungsproblem
(decision problem).
[6]
This eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of computer science and software engineering; both fields study software and its creation.
[7]
Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering principles to development of software.
[8]
In 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that
John Wilder Tukey
's 1958 paper "The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics"
[9]
[10]
contained the earliest known usage of the term "software" found in a search of
JSTOR
's electronic archives, predating the
Oxford English Dictionary
's citation by two years.
[11]
This led many to credit Tukey with coining the term, particularly in obituaries published that same year,
[12]
although Tukey never claimed credit for any such coinage. In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.
[13]
The earliest known publication of the term "software" in an engineering context was in August 1953 by Richard R. Carhart, in a
Rand Corporation
Research Memorandum.
[14]
Types
See also:
Software categories
Blender
, a
free software
program
On virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories.
Purpose, or domain of use
Based on the goal, computer software can be divided into:
Application software
uses the computer system to perform special functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large—see
list of software
.
System software
manages hardware behaviour, as to provide basic functionalities that are required by users, or for other software to run properly, if at all. System software is also designed for providing a platform for running application software,
[15]
and it includes the following:
Operating systems
are essential collections of software that manage resources and provide common services for other software that runs "on top" of them.
Supervisory programs
,
boot loaders
,
shells
and
window systems
are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.
Device drivers
operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.
Utilities
are computer programs designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.
Malicious software
, or
malware
, is software that is developed to harm or disrupt computers. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as
practical jokes
.
Nature or domain of execution
Desktop applications
such as
web browsers
and
Microsoft Office
and
LibreOffice
and
WordPerfect
, as well as
smartphone
and
tablet
applications (called "
apps
").
[

]
JavaScript
scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in
web pages
that are run directly inside the web browser when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is
ActionScript
scripts, which are supported by the
Adobe Flash
plugin.
[
citation needed
]
Server software
, including:
Web applications
, which usually run on the
web server
and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g.
PHP
,
Java
,
ASP.NET
, or even
JavaScript that runs on the server
. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.
[
citation needed
]
Plugins
and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function.
[16]
Embedded software
resides as
firmware
within
embedded systems
, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as
cars
and
televisions
(although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can
themselves
be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).
[17]
In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run
embedded operating systems
, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed application which is always run).
[
citation needed
]
Microcode
is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor
itself
how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code.
[
citation needed
]
It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.
[
citation needed
]
Programming tools
Main article:
Programming tool
Programming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that
developers
use to create,
debug
,
maintain
, or otherwise
support
software.
[18]
[
better source needed
]
Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many
programming languages
in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as
compilers
,
debuggers
,
interpreters
,
linkers
, and
text editors
, that can be combined to accomplish a task; or they may form an
integrated development environment
(IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools.
[
citation needed
]
IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way.
[
citation needed
]
An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project.
[
citation needed
]
Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.
[
citation needed
]
Topics
Architecture
See also:
Software architecture
People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to
embedded systems
,
analog computers
and
supercomputers
) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.
[
citation needed
]
Platform software
: The
platform
includes the
firmware
,
device drivers
, an
operating system
, and typically a
graphical user interface
which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its
peripherals
(associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a
PC
one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.
Application software
:
Application software
is what most people think of when they think of software.
[
citation needed
]
Typical examples include office suites and
video games
. Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other "system software" as applications.
[
citation needed
]
User-written software
:
End-user development
tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software includes spreadsheet templates and
word processor
templates.
[
citation needed
]
Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.
[
citation needed
]
Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.
[
citation needed
]
Execution
Main article:
Execution (computing)
Computer software has to be "loaded" into the computer's
storage
(such as the
hard drive
or
memory
). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to
execute
the software. This involves passing instructions from the application software, through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation—moving data, carrying out a
computation
, or altering the
control flow
of instructions.
[
citation needed
]
Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly; this is sometimes avoided by using "pointers" to data instead.
[
citation needed
]
Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.
[
citation needed
]
Quality and reliability
Main articles:
Software quality
and
Software testing
Software quality is very important, especially for
commercial
and system software. If software is faulty, it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called "
bugs
" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing.
[
citation needed
]
Software is often also a victim to what is known as
software aging
, the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.
[
citation needed
]
Many bugs are discovered and fixed through
software testing
. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (Lubarsky's Law).
[19]
In the
waterfall
method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed
agile software development
, developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback.
[
citation needed
]
Software can be tested through
unit testing
,
regression testing
and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be large.
[
citation needed
]
Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.
[20]
License
Main article:
Software license
The software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of
free software licenses
, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.
[21]
Proprietary software
can be divided into two types:
freeware
, which includes the category of "free trial" software or "
freemium
" software (in the past, the term
shareware
was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used for free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.
[22]
software available for a fee, which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.
[23]
Open-source software
comes with a free software license, granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.
[24]
Patents
Main articles:
Software patent
and
Software patent debate
Software patents, like other types of
patents
, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a
detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement
a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could
do
, and user
requirements
, are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either—the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid—although since
all
useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.
[25]
Software patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for
aspect-oriented programming
(AOP), which purported to claim rights over
any
programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented.
[
citation needed
]
Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation.
[
citation needed
]
In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.
[
citation needed
]
Design and implementation
Main articles:
Software development
,
Computer programming
, and
Software engineering
Design and implementation of software vary depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of
Microsoft Word
took much more time than designing and developing
Microsoft Notepad
because the former has much more basic functionality.
[
citation needed
]
Software is usually developed in
integrated development environments
(IDE) like
Eclipse
,
IntelliJ
and
Microsoft Visual Studio
that can simplify the process and
compile
the software.
[
citation needed
]
As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the
application programming interface
(API) that the underlying software provides like
GTK+
, JavaBeans or
Swing
.
[
citation needed
]
Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the
Spring Framework
is used for implementing
enterprise applications
, the
Windows Forms
library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like Microsoft Word, and
Windows Communication Foundation
is used for designing
web services
.
[
citation needed
]
When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, a Microsoft Windows desktop application might call API functions in the
.NET
Windows Forms library like
Form1.Close()
and
Form1.Show()
[26]
to close or open the application. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like
Oracle
and
Microsoft
provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their
software libraries
that usually have numerous APIs in them.
[
citation needed
]
Data structures
such as
hash tables
,
arrays
, and
binary trees
, and
algorithms
such as
quicksort
, can be useful for creating software.
Computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.
[
specify
]
[27]
[28]
A person who creates software is called a
programmer
,
software engineer
or software developer, terms that all have a similar meaning. More informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "hacker" - although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean
someone who illegally breaks into computer systems
.

Mandavya
(
Sanskrit
:
माण्डव्य
,
romanized
:
Māṇḍavya
), also called
Aṇi Māṇḍavya
, is a sage in
Hinduism
. He is best known for a legend where he is wrongfully punished by a king by impalement.
[1]
Legend
[
edit

Impalement
[
edit
]
According to the
Mahabharata
, Mandavya was once performing a
tapas
with his arms raised, standing in front of his
ashrama
for many years. During this period, some thieves happened to pass by his ashrama, having stolen property belonging to the king. Finding that the king’s men were pursuing them, the thieves fled, after leaving their stolen property in the sage's ashrama. The king’s men seized Mandavya, believing him to be an accomplice. Mandavya refused to talk to his accusers. When the thieves were caught, Mandavya also along produced before the king, and they were all condemned to death. The thieves and the sage were struck at the tip of a trident, and while the thieves died, Mandavya stayed alive.
[2]
According to the
Brahmanda Purana
, even as the sage underwent this suffering,
Ugrashravas
, the husband of Shilavati, wished to visit the house of his favourite prostitute, and Shilavati agreed to carry him to her house. When the couple came across Mandavya, the latter understood the man's intentions, and cursed him to die before the next sunrise. Horrified, Shilavati, with her piety, ensured that
Surya
, the sun god, would not rise the next dawn. Since this led to universal chaos, the
devas
approached
Anasuya
, who convinced Shilavati to have the sun rise again.
[3]
Shiva
blessed the sage with longevity, and several sages appeared before Mandavya, making enquiries regarding him. When the king realised that Mandavya was innocent, he rushed to seek the sage's forgiveness. His men tried to pull the trident from his body, but were unable to do so. Finally, the sage had to be released by cutting the trident, with its tip (Aṇi) remaining in his form. Hence, he came to be known as Aṇi Mandavya.
[4]
Cursing Dharma
[
edit
]
Mandavya approached
Dharma
(Sometimes identified with
Yama
), asking why an innocent man like him had suffered the hardship that he had gone through. Dharma answered by stating that Mandavya had tortured small birds when he was a boy, and his impalement had been the punishment. The sage countered that the
Shashtras
stated that no man should have to suffer for any sin committed before the age of twelve, arguing that he had been unjustly punished. Since Dharma had attempted to murder him, a
Brahmin
, the greatest of sins, he cursed the deity to be born as a
Shudra
on earth. Accordingly, Dharma incarnated himself as
Vidura
in the
Mahabharata
.

The
M7 Spider
is a networked United States anti-personnel munitions system that provides a secure remote command and control capability of up to 1500 meters for a hand-emplaced munition field.  The system was developed by
Alliant Techsystems (ATK)
with its joint venture partner
Textron Systems
as a part of the Non-Self-Destruct Alternative (NSD-A) program and is intended to replace the Matrix remote trigger system currently deployed in Iraq which works with pre-existing mines like the
M18 Claymore
.
Day & Zimmermann
and
General Dynamics
are prime subcontractors.
[1]
Design
[
edit
]
M7 Spider MCU with 3 MGLs
The system is composed of Munition Control Units (MCUs),
[2]
a Remote Control Station (RCS), and a repeater for extending communication range.  Up to 63 MCUs can be configured for each RCS. Each MCU can attach up to six Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGL) each of which covers a sixty degree arc.
[3]
The MCUs are hand emplaced after which the operator can optionally command to deploy six triplines to provide a sensing network. The operator can be situated up to a mile away from the munition or further with the use of a repeater.
[4]
When a tripline is activated, the MCU connected to the line signals wirelessly to the Remote Control Station using either the U.S. Army battlefield key management infrastructure or the Navy Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). The operator at the RCS can at that point choose to fire one or more of the attached munitions (grenades or other.)
[5]
[6]
The M-7 Spider can also be ordered to "zeroize", purge all data stored in its memory to prevent the systems from being removed by the enemy. Additionally, if the system is tampered with or transported while armed it will become disabled. The M7 Spider does not have the ability to self-destruct or become a victim activated mine or explosive device.
[7]
History
[
edit
]
Developed to bridge the gap between remote battlefield sensor and anti-personnel mines, the M7 Spider Networked Munition System was originally designed to be either victim activated or operator initiated. In accordance with the 2004 U. S. National Landmine Policy, The M7 Spider was permanently configured as a "Man-In-The-Loop" (MITL) weapon system with all victim activated capabilities removed.
[8]
Wired reported in 2004 that the Army intended to purchase 290,000 spider munitions at a cost of $513 million
US dollars
.

Margaret
, known as
Margaret of Antioch
in the West, and as
Saint Marina the Great Martyr
(
Greek
:
Ἁγία Μαρίνα
) in the East, is celebrated as a
saint
on 20 July in
Western Christianity
, on 17 July (
Julian calendar
) by the
Eastern Orthodox Church
, and on
Epip
23 and
Hathor
23 in the
Coptic Orthodox Church
.
She was reputed to have promised very powerful
indulgences
to those who wrote or read her
life
, or invoked her
intercessions
; these no doubt helped the spread of her following.
[2]
Margaret is one of the
Fourteen Holy Helpers
, and is one of the saints
Joan of Arc
claimed to have spoken with.
Hagiography
[
edit
]
According to a 9th-century martyrology of
Rabanus Maurus
, she suffered at
Antioch in Pisidia
(in what is now Turkey) in around 304, during the
Diocletianic persecution
. She was the daughter of a pagan priest named Aedesius. Her mother having died soon after her birth, Margaret was nursed by a Christian woman five or six leagues (6.9-8.3 miles) from Antioch. Having embraced Christianity and consecrated her
virginity
to God, Margaret was disowned by her father, adopted by her nurse, and lived in the country keeping sheep with her foster mother.
[3]
[4]
Olybrius, Governor of the Roman
Diocese of the East
, asked to marry her, but with the demand that she
renounce
Christianity
. Upon her refusal, she was cruelly
tortured
, during which various miraculous incidents occurred.
One of these involved being swallowed by
Satan
in the shape of a
dragon
, from which she escaped alive when the
cross
she carried irritated the dragon's innards. Eventually, she was decapitated.
Historicity
[
edit
]
According to the
Encyclopædia Britannica
, Margaret's story is "generally regarded to be fictitious".
[4]
[5]
The
Catholic Encyclopedia
states that "even the century to which she belonged is uncertain".
[6]
Doubts about her story are not new: already in the
Middle Ages
,
hagiographer
Jacobus de Voragine
(author of the well-known
Golden Legend
) considered her martyrology to be too fantastic and remarked that the part where she is eaten by the dragon was to be considered a legend.
[7]
Veneration
[
edit
]
The Greek Marina came from Antioch, Antioch in Pisidia (as opposed to
Antioch
of
Syria
), but this distinction was lost in the West. From the east her veneration spread towards England, France, and Germany, in the eleventh century, during the Crusades.
In 1222, the
Council of Oxford
added her to the list of feast days, and so her cult acquired great popularity. Many versions of the story were told in 13th-century England, in Anglo-Norman (including one ascribed to
Nicholas Bozon
), English, and Latin,
[8]
and more than 250 churches are dedicated to her in England, most famously,
St. Margaret's, Westminster
, the
parish church
[9]
of the British
Houses of Parliament
in
London
.
[4]
There is also a
Saint Margaret Shrine
in
Bridgeport, Connecticut
in the United States.
Feast day
[
edit
]
She was recognised as a saint by the
Catholic Church
, being listed as such in the
Roman Martyrology
for 20 July.
[10]
She was also included from the 12th to the 20th century among the saints to be commemorated wherever the
Roman Rite
was celebrated,
[11]
but was then removed from
the general calendar
along with a number of other European saints through the apostolic letter
Mysterii Paschalis
.
[12]
The
Eastern Orthodox Church
knows Margaret as Saint Marina, and celebrates her
feast day
on 17 July. Margaret is
remembered
in the
Church of England
with a
commemoration
on
20 July
.
[13]
Every year on Epip 23 the
Coptic Orthodox church
celebrates her martyrdom day, and on Hathor 23 the Coptic church celebrates the dedication of a church to her name.
Saint Mary church
in Cairo holds a
relic
believed to be Margaret's right hand, previously moved from the Angel Michael Church (modernly known as Haret Al Gawayna) following its destruction in the 13th century AD.
In 2022, Margaret was officially added to the
Episcopal Church liturgical calendar
with a feast day she shares with
Catherine of Alexandria
and
Barbara of Nicomedia
on 24 November.
[14]
Patronage
[
edit
]
Margaret of Antioch is a patroness of pregnant women, servant maids, and against diabolical infestations.
Iconography
[
edit
]
In art, she is often represented as a shepherdess, or pictured escaping from, or standing above, a dragon. While Western iconography typically depicts St. Margaret emerging from the dragon, Eastern Byzantine iconography tends to focus on her battle with the demon in her cell and depicts her grabbing him by his hair and swinging a copper hammer at his face.

[ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ

ⓘ
;
[12]
Ulster-Scots
:
Norlin Airlann
) is a
part
of the
United Kingdom
in the north-east of the island of
Ireland
that is
variously described
as a country, province or region.
[13]
[14]
[15]
[16]
Northern Ireland shares
an open border
to the south and west with the
Republic of Ireland
. At the
2021 census
, its population was 1,903,100,
[17]
making up around 3% of the
UK's population
and 27% of the population on the island of
Ireland
. The
Northern Ireland Assembly
, established by the
Northern Ireland Act 1998
, holds responsibility for a range of
devolved
policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the
UK Government
. The
government of Northern Ireland
cooperates with the
government of Ireland
in several areas under the terms of the
Belfast Agreement
.
[18]
The Republic of Ireland also has a consultative role on non-devolved governmental matters through the British-Irish Governmental Conference (BIIG).
[19]
Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when
Ireland was partitioned
by the
Government of Ireland Act 1920
, creating a devolved government for the
six northeastern counties
. As was intended by unionists and their supporters in
Westminster
, Northern Ireland had a
unionist
majority, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom;
[20]
they were generally the
Protestant
descendants of
colonists from Britain
. Meanwhile, the majority in
Southern Ireland
(which became the
Irish Free State
in 1922), and a significant minority in Northern Ireland, were
Irish nationalists
(generally
Catholics
) who wanted a
united independent Ireland
.
[21]
Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a Northern Irish or
Ulster
identity is claimed by a significant minority from all backgrounds.
[22]
The creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During
the conflict of 1920-22
, the capital
Belfast
saw major
communal violence
, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians.
[23]
More than 500 were killed
[24]
and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics.
[25]
For the next fifty years, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of
Unionist Party governments
.
[26]
There was informal mutual
segregation
by both communities,
[27]
and the Unionist governments were accused of discrimination against the Irish nationalist and Catholic minority.
[28]
In the late 1960s, a
campaign to end discrimination
against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by
loyalists
, who saw it as a
republican
front.
[29]
This unrest sparked
the Troubles
, a thirty-year conflict involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries and state forces, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured 50,000 others.
[30]
[31]
The 1998
Good Friday Agreement
was a major step in the
peace process
, including
paramilitary disarmament
and security normalisation, although
sectarianism
and segregation remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued.
[32]
The
economy of Northern Ireland
was the most industrialised in Ireland at the time of partition, but soon began to decline, a decline exacerbated by the political and social turmoil of the Troubles.
[33]
Its economy has grown significantly since the late 1990s. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, but dropped back down to below 10% in the 2010s,
[34]
similar to the rate of the rest of the UK.
[35]
Cultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and the rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the
culture of Ireland
and the
culture of the United Kingdom
. In many sports, there is an
All-Ireland
governing body or team for the whole island; the most notable exception is association football. Northern Ireland
competes separately
at the
Commonwealth Games
, and people from Northern Ireland may compete for either
Great Britain
or
Ireland
at the
Olympic Games
.
History
Main article:
History of Northern Ireland
See also:
History of Ireland
and
Ulster § History
Derry Peace Bridge
, over the
River Foyle
The region that is now Northern Ireland was long inhabited by native
Gaels
who were Irish-speaking and predominantly Catholic.
[36]
It was made up of several Gaelic kingdoms and territories and was part of the province of
Ulster
. In 1169,
Ireland was invaded by a coalition
of forces under the command of the English crown that quickly overran and occupied most of the island, beginning 800 years of foreign central authority. Attempts at resistance were swiftly crushed everywhere outside of Ulster. Unlike in the rest of the country, where Gaelic authority continued only in scattered, remote pockets, the major kingdoms of Ulster would mostly remain intact with English authority in the province contained to
areas on the eastern coast
closest to Great Britain. English power gradually eroded in the face of stubborn Irish resistance in the centuries that followed; eventually being reduced to only the city of Dublin and its suburbs. When
Henry VIII
launched the 16th century
Tudor re-conquest of Ireland
, Ulster once again resisted most effectively. In the
Nine Years' War
(1594-1603), an alliance of Gaelic chieftains led by the two most powerful Ulster lords,
Hugh Roe O'Donnell
and the
Earl of Tyrone
fought against the
English government in Ireland
. The Ulster-dominated alliance represented the first Irish united front; prior resistance had always been geographically localized. Despite being able to cement an alliance with Spain and major victories early on, defeat was virtually inevitable following England's victory at the
siege of Kinsale
. In 1607, the rebellion's leaders
fled to mainland Europe
alongside much of Ulster's Gaelic nobility. Their lands were confiscated by
the Crown
and colonized with English-speaking Protestant
settlers
from Britain, in the
Plantation of Ulster
. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns and created a lasting
Ulster Protestant
community with ties to Britain. The
Irish Rebellion of 1641
began in Ulster. The rebels wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the Plantation. It developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics and British Protestant settlers and became part of the wider
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
(1639-53), which ended with the
English Parliamentarian conquest
. Further Protestant victories in the
Williamite-Jacobite War
(1688-91) solidified
Anglican Protestant
rule in the
Kingdom of Ireland
. The Williamite victories of the
siege of Derry
(1689) and
Battle of the Boyne
(1690) are still celebrated by some Protestants in Northern Ireland.
[37]
Many more Scots Protestants migrated to Ulster during the
Scottish famine of the 1690s
.
Following the Williamite victory, and contrary to the
Treaty of Limerick
(1691), a series of
Penal Laws
were passed by the
Anglican Protestant ruling class
in Ireland. The intention was to disadvantage Catholics and, to a lesser extent,
Presbyterians
. Some 250,000 Ulster Presbyterians emigrated to the
British North American
colonies between 1717 and 1775.
[38]
It is estimated that there are more than 27 million
Scotch-Irish Americans
now living in the United States,
[39]
along with many
Scotch-Irish Canadians
in Canada. In the context of institutional discrimination, the 18th century saw secret, militant societies develop in Ulster and act on sectarian tensions in violent attacks. This escalated at the end of the century, especially during the County
Armagh disturbances
, where the Protestant
Peep o' Day Boys
fought the
Catholic Defenders
. This led to the founding of the Protestant
Orange Order
. The
Irish Rebellion of 1798
was led by the
United Irishmen
; a cross-community
Irish republican
group founded by Belfast Presbyterians, which sought Irish independence. Following this, the government of the
Kingdom of Great Britain
pushed for the two kingdoms to be merged, in an attempt to quell violent sectarianism, remove discriminatory laws, and prevent the spread of French-style republicanism. The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
was formed in 1801 and governed from London. During the 19th century, legal reforms known as the
Catholic emancipation
continued to remove discrimination against Catholics, and progressive programs enabled tenant farmers to buy land from landlords.
Home Rule Crisis

Signing of the
Ulster Covenant
in 1912 in opposition to Home Rule
By the late 19th century, a large and disciplined cohort of
Irish Nationalist
MPs at Westminster committed the
Liberal Party
to
"Irish Home Rule"
—self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. This was bitterly opposed by
Irish Unionists
, most of whom were Protestants, who feared an Irish devolved government dominated by Irish nationalists and Catholics. The
Government of Ireland Bill 1886
and
Government of Ireland Bill 1893
were defeated. However, Home Rule became a near-certainty in 1912 after the
Government of Ireland Act 1914
was first introduced. The Liberal government was dependent on Nationalist support, and the
Parliament Act 1911
prevented the House of Lords from blocking the bill indefinitely.
[40]
In response, unionists vowed to prevent Irish Home Rule, from
Conservative and Unionist Party
leaders such as
Bonar Law
and Dublin-based barrister
Edward Carson
to militant working class unionists in Ireland. This sparked the
Home Rule Crisis
. In September 1912, more than 500,000 unionists signed the
Ulster Covenant
, pledging to oppose Home Rule by any means and to defy any Irish government.
[41]
In 1914, unionists
smuggled thousands of rifles and rounds of ammunition
from
Imperial Germany
for use by the
Ulster Volunteers
(UVF), a paramilitary organisation formed to oppose Home Rule. Irish nationalists had also formed a paramilitary organisation, the
Irish Volunteers
. It sought to ensure Home Rule was implemented, and it
smuggled its own weapons into Ireland
a few months after the Ulster Volunteers.
[42]
Ireland seemed to be on the brink of civil war.
[43]
Unionists were in a minority in Ireland as a whole, but a majority in the province of
Ulster
, especially the counties
Antrim
,
Down
,
Armagh
and
Londonderry
.
[44]
Unionists argued that if Home Rule could not be stopped then all or part of Ulster should be excluded from it.
[45]
In May 1914, the UK Government introduced an Amending Bill to allow for 'Ulster' to be excluded from Home Rule. There was then debate over how much of Ulster should be excluded and for how long. Some Ulster unionists were willing to tolerate the 'loss' of some mainly-Catholic areas of the province.
[46]
The crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the
First World War
in August 1914, and
Ireland's involvement in it
. The UK government abandoned the Amending Bill, and instead rushed through a new bill, the
Suspensory Act 1914
, suspending Home Rule for the duration of the war,
[47]
with the exclusion of Ulster still to be decided.
[48]
Partition of Ireland
Main article:
Partition of Ireland
Result of the
1918 general election in Ireland
By the end of the war (during which the 1916
Easter Rising
had taken place), most Irish nationalists now wanted full independence rather than home rule. In September 1919, British Prime Minister
David Lloyd George
tasked a committee with planning another home rule bill. Headed by
English unionist
politician
Walter Long
, it was known as the 'Long Committee'. It decided that two devolved governments should be established—one for the nine counties of Ulster and one for the rest of Ireland—together with a
Council of Ireland
for the "encouragement of Irish unity".
[49]
Most Ulster unionists wanted the territory of the Ulster government to be reduced to six counties so that it would have a larger Protestant unionist majority, which they believed would guarantee its longevity. The six counties of
Antrim
,
Down
,
Armagh
,
Londonderry
,
Tyrone
and
Fermanagh
comprised the maximum area unionists believed they could dominate,
[50]
The area that was to become Northern Ireland included counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, even though they had nationalist majorities in the
1918 Irish general election
.
[51]
Events overtook the government. In the 1918 Irish general election, the pro-independence
Sinn Féin
party won the overwhelming majority of Irish seats. Sinn Féin's elected members boycotted the British parliament and founded a separate Irish parliament (
Dáil Éireann
),
declaring an independent Irish Republic
covering the whole island. Many
Irish republicans
blamed the British establishment for the sectarian divisions in Ireland, and believed that Ulster unionism would fade once British rule was ended.
[52]
The British authorities outlawed the Dáil in September 1919,
[53]
and a guerrilla conflict developed as the
Irish Republican Army
(IRA) began attacking British forces. This became known as the
Irish War of Independence
.
[54]
Crowds in Belfast for the state opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament on 22 June 1921
Meanwhile, the
Government of Ireland Act 1920
passed through the British parliament in 1920. It would divide Ireland into two self-governing UK territories: the six northeastern counties (Northern Ireland) being ruled from
Belfast
, and the other twenty-six counties (
Southern Ireland
) being ruled from
Dublin
. Both would have a shared
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
, who would appoint both governments and a
Council of Ireland
, which the UK government intended to evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.
[55]
The Act received
royal assent
that December, becoming the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It came into force on 3 May 1921,
[56]
[57]
partitioning Ireland
and creating Northern Ireland. the
1921 Irish elections
were held on 24 May, in which unionists won most seats in the Northern Ireland parliament. It first met on 7 June and formed its
first devolved government
, headed by Ulster Unionist Party leader
James Craig
. Irish nationalist members refused to attend. King George V addressed the ceremonial opening of the Northern parliament on 22 June.
[56]
During 1920-22, in what became Northern Ireland, partition was accompanied by violence "in defence or opposition to the new settlement"
[23]
during
The Troubles (1920-1922)
. The IRA carried out attacks on British forces in the north-east but was less active than in the rest of Ireland. Protestant loyalists attacked Catholics in reprisal for IRA actions. In the summer of 1920, sectarian violence erupted in Belfast and Derry, and there were mass burnings of Catholic property in
Lisburn
and
Banbridge
.
[58]
Conflict continued intermittently for two years, mostly in
Belfast
, which saw "savage and unprecedented"
communal violence
between Protestants and Catholics, including rioting, gun battles, and bombings. Homes, businesses, and churches were attacked and people were expelled from workplaces and mixed neighbourhoods.
[23]
More than 500 were killed
[24]
and more than 10,000 became refugees, most of them Catholics.
[59]
The
British Army
was deployed and the
Ulster Special Constabulary
(USC) was formed to help the regular police. The USC was almost wholly Protestant. Members of the USC and regular police were involved in reprisal attacks on Catholic civilians.
[60]
A truce between British forces and the IRA was established on 11 July 1921, ending the fighting in most of Ireland. However, communal violence continued in Belfast, and in 1922 the IRA launched a guerrilla offensive along the new
Irish border
.
[61]
The
Anglo-Irish Treaty
was signed between representatives of the governments of the UK and the
Irish Republic
on 6 December 1921, creating the
Irish Free State
. Under the terms of the treaty, Northern Ireland would become part of the Free State unless its government opted out by presenting an address to the king, although in practice partition remained in place.
[62]
The
Coat of arms of Northern Ireland
used between 1924 and 1973
As expected, the
Parliament of Northern Ireland
resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) to exercise its right to opt out of the Free State by making an address to King
George V
.
[63]
The text of the address was:
Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the
Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922
, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.
[64]
Shortly afterwards, the
Irish Boundary Commission
was established to decide on the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Owing to the outbreak of the
Irish Civil War
, the work of the commission was delayed until 1925. The Free State government and Irish nationalists hoped for a large transfer of territory to the Free State, as many border areas had nationalist majorities. Many believed this would leave the remaining Northern Ireland territory too small to be viable.
[65]
However, the commission's final report recommended only small transfers of territory, and in both directions. The Free State, Northern Ireland, and UK governments agreed to suppress the report and accept the
status quo
, while the UK government agreed that the Free State would no longer have to pay a share of the UK national debt.

James Craig (centre) with members of the first government of Northern Ireland
Opening of the Northern Ireland parliament buildings (
Stormont
) in 1932
Northern Ireland's border was drawn to give it "a decisive Protestant majority". At the time of its creation, Northern Ireland's population was two-thirds Protestant and one-third Catholic.
[20]
Most Protestants were unionists/loyalists who sought to maintain Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, while most Catholics were Irish nationalists/republicans who sought an independent
United Ireland
. There was mutual self-imposed
segregation in Northern Ireland
between Protestants and Catholics such as in education, housing, and often employment.
[67]
For its first fifty years, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of
Ulster Unionist Party governments
.
[68]
Every prime minister and almost every minister of these governments were members of the
Orange Order
, as were all but 11 of the 149
Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP) MPs elected during this time.
[69]
Almost all judges and magistrates were Protestant, many of them closely associated with the UUP. Northern Ireland's new police force was the
Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC), which succeeded the
Royal Irish Constabulary
(RIC). It too was almost wholly Protestant and lacked operational independence, responding to directions from government ministers. The RUC and the reserve
Ulster Special Constabulary
(USC) were militarized police forces due to the perceived threat of militant republicanism. In 1936 the British advocacy group - the
National Council for Civil Liberties
characterised the USC as "nothing but the organised army of the Unionist party".
[70]
They "had at their disposal the
Special Powers Act
, a sweeping piece of legislation which allowed arrests without warrant, internment without trial, unlimited search powers, and bans on meetings and publications".
[71]
This 1922 Act was made permanent in 1933 and was not repealed until 1973.
[72]
The
Nationalist Party
was the main political party in opposition to the UUP governments. However, its elected members often protested by
abstaining
from the Northern Ireland parliament, and many nationalists did not vote in parliamentary elections.
[67]
Other early nationalist groups which campaigned against partition included the
National League of the North
(formed in 1928), the
Northern Council for Unity
(formed in 1937) and the
Irish Anti-Partition League
(formed in 1945).
[73]
The Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) of 1922 allowed for the altering of municipal and rural boundaries. This Act led to the
gerrymandering
of election boundaries in the Nationalists majority cities of Derry City, Enniskillen, Omagh, Armagh and many other towns and rural districts. That action ensured Unionist control over local councils in areas where they were a minority.
[74]
The UUP governments, and some UUP-dominated local authorities, discriminated against the Catholic and Irish nationalist minority; especially by the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, the allocation of public housing, public sector employment, and policing, showing "a consistent and irrefutable pattern of deliberate discrimination against Catholics".
[75]
Many Catholics/Nationalists saw the gerrymandered electoral boundaries and the abolishing of
proportional representation
as proof of government sponsored discrimination. Until 1969 a system was in place called
plural voting
which was a practice whereby one person might be able to vote multiple times in an election. Property and business owners could vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived, if the two were different. This system often resulted in one person being able to cast multiple votes.
[76]
Decades later, UUP
First Minister of Northern Ireland
,
David Trimble
, said that Northern Ireland under the UUP had been a "cold house" for Catholics.
[77]
The Belfast Harbour Office
has been the headquarters for the Harbour Commissioners for more than 150 years.
During
World War II
, recruitment to the British military was noticeably lower than the high levels reached during World War I. In June 1940, to encourage the
neutral Irish state
to join with the
Allies
, British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
indicated to Taoiseach
Éamon de Valera
that the British government would encourage Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.
[78]
The British did not inform the government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and de Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970. Belfast was a key industrial city in the UK's war effort, producing ships, tanks, aircraft, and munitions. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared, prompting migration from the Free State. The city was thinly defended, and had only 24 anti-aircraft guns. Richard
Dawson Bates
, the Minister for Home Affairs, had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, and as the Northern Ireland government had been reluctant to spend money on air raid shelters, it only started to build them after
the Blitz
in London during the autumn of 1940. There were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers more difficult. In April-May 1941, the
Belfast Blitz
began when the
Luftwaffe
launched a series of raids that were the most deadly seen outside London. Working class areas in the north and east of the city were particularly hard hit, and over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Tens of thousands of people fled the city in fear of future attacks. In the final raid,
Luftwaffe
bombs inflicted extensive damage to the docks and the
Harland & Wolff
shipyard, closing it for six months. Half of the city's houses had been destroyed, highlighting the terrible slum conditions in Belfast, and about £20 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland Prime Minister
J. M. Andrews
resigned. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.
[79]
The
Ireland Act 1949
gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the
Parliament of Northern Ireland
.
From 1956 to 1962, the
Irish Republican Army
(IRA) carried out a limited guerrilla campaign in border areas of Northern Ireland, called the
Border Campaign
. It aimed to destabilize Northern Ireland and bring about an end to partition but failed.
[80]
In 1965, Northern Ireland's Prime Minister
Terence O'Neill
met the Taoiseach,
Seán Lemass
. It was the first meeting between the two heads of government since partition.
[81]
The Troubles
Main article:
The Troubles
The Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about 30 years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed
[82]
with over 50,000 casualties.
[83]
From 1969 to 2003 there were over 36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings associated with The Troubles.
[31]
The conflict was caused by escalating tensions between the
Irish nationalist
minority and the dominant
unionist majority
; Irish nationalists object to Northern Ireland staying within the United Kingdom.
[84]
From 1967 to 1972 the
Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association
(NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of
civil resistance
to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures. The franchise for local government elections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a quarter of the electorate. While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home.
[85]
Responsibility for Troubles-related deaths between 1969 and 2001
NICRA's campaign, seen by many unionists as an
Irish republican
front, and the violent reaction to it proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.
[86]
As early as 1969, armed campaigns of paramilitary groups began, including the
Provisional IRA campaign of 1969-1997
which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and the creation of a
United Ireland
, and the
Ulster Volunteer Force
, formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the British character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. The state security forces - the
British Army
and the police (the
Royal Ulster Constabulary
) - were also involved in the violence. The UK Government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the state forces as
combatants
in the conflict, pointing to the
collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries
as proof of this. The "Ballast" investigation by the
Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland
has confirmed that British forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims had been investigated,
[87]
although the extent to which such collusion occurred is still disputed.
As a consequence of the worsening security situation, the autonomous regional government for Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned the violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland. In 1973,
Northern Ireland held a referendum
to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland. The vote went heavily in favour (98.9%) of maintaining the status quo. Approximately 57.5% of the total electorate voted in support, but only 1% of Catholics voted following a boycott organised by the
Social Democratic and Labour Party
(SDLP).
[88]
Peace process
Main article:
Northern Ireland peace process
The Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and
Fermanagh
, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the "
Good Friday Agreement
"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The
Constitution of Ireland
was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the "Irish nation" to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2).

The new
Articles 2 and 3
, added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in each jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast Agreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held simultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time, the UK Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called "Irish dimension": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.
[90]
The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement from nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government, the
Northern Ireland Assembly
, located on the
Stormont Estate
, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. These institutions were suspended by the
UK Government
in 2002 after
Police Service of Northern Ireland
(PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn Féin at the Assembly (
Stormontgate
). The resulting case against the accused Sinn Féin member collapsed.
[91]
On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its
arsenal
. This final act of decommissioning was performed under the watch of the
Independent International Commission on Decommissioning
(IICD) and two external church witnesses. Many unionists, however, remained skeptical. The IICD later confirmed that the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the
Ulster Defence Association
, UVF, and the
Red Hand Commando
, had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals, witnessed by former archbishop
Robin Eames
and a former top civil servant.
[92]
Politicians elected to the Assembly at the
2003 Assembly election
were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006
[93]
to elect a
First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland
and choose the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to the restoration of devolved government.
Following the
election on 7 March 2007
, the devolved government returned on 8 May 2007 with
Democratic Unionist Party
(DUP) leader
Ian Paisley
and Sinn Féin deputy leader
Martin McGuinness
taking office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.
[94]
In its
white paper
on
Brexit
the United Kingdom government reiterated its commitment to the Belfast Agreement. Concerning Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's "clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland's current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland".
[95]
Politics
Main article:
Politics of Northern Ireland
Background
A flowchart illustrating all the political parties that have existed throughout the history of Northern Ireland and leading up to its formation (covering 1889 to 2020)
The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom. These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly
Ulster Protestant
, descendants of mainly
Scottish
, English, and
Huguenot
settlers as well as
Gaels
who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the
Scottish Highlands
as well as some converts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the
Stormont
government (1921-1972) gave rise to the
civil rights movement
in the 1960s.
[96]
While some unionists argue that discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors,
[97]
its existence, and the manner in which nationalist anger at it was handled, were a major contributing factor to the Troubles. The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994.
[98]
Mixture of new and historic buildings in
Belfast
In 2007, 36% of the population defined themselves as unionist, 24% as nationalist, and 40% defined themselves as neither.
[99]
According to a 2015 opinion poll, 70% express a long-term preference of the maintenance of Northern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either
directly ruled
or with
devolved government
), while 14% express a preference for membership of a united Ireland.
[100]
This discrepancy can be explained by the overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK (93%), while Catholic preferences are spread across several solutions to the constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a united Ireland (32%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (4%), and those who "don't know" (16%).
[101]
Official voting figures, which reflect views on the "national question" along with issues of the candidate, geography, personal loyalty, and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for unionist parties, 42% vote for nationalist parties, and 4% vote "other". Opinion polls consistently show that the election results are not necessarily an indication of the electorate's stance regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Most of the population of Northern Ireland are at least nominally Christian, mostly Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Many voters (regardless of religious affiliation) are attracted to unionism's
conservative
policies, while other voters are instead attracted to the traditionally leftist Sinn Féin and SDLP and their respective party platforms for
democratic socialism
and
social democracy
.
[102]
For the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question. Protestants have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland census. The make-up of the
Northern Ireland Assembly
reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population. Of the 90
Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs)
, 37 are unionists and 35 are nationalists (the remaining 18 are classified as "other").

,
Belfast
, seat of the assembly
Since 1998, Northern Ireland has had
devolved
government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the
Northern Ireland Assembly
and a cross-community government (the
Northern Ireland Executive
). The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for
reserved and excepted matters
. Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as
civil aviation
,
units of measurement
, and
human genetics
) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly some time in the future. Excepted matters (such as
international relations
, taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland. Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the
North/South Ministerial Council
, which coordinates areas of cooperation (such as agriculture, education, and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, "in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland", the
Government of Ireland
and
Government of the United Kingdom
co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the
British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference
.
Elections to the
Northern Ireland Assembly
are by
single transferable vote
with five Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) elected from each of 18
parliamentary constituencies
. In addition, eighteen representatives (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected to the
lower house of the UK parliament
from the same constituencies using the
first-past-the-post
system. However, not all of those elected take their seats. Sinn Féin MPs, currently seven, refuse to take the oath to serve the King that is required before MPs are allowed to take their seats. In addition, the upper house of the UK parliament, the
House of Lords
, currently has some 25 appointed
members from Northern Ireland
.

represents the UK Government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters and represents Northern Ireland's interests within the UK Government. Additionally, the Republic's government also has the right to "put forward views and proposals" on non-devolved matters about Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
, who sits in the
Cabinet of the United Kingdom
.
Northern Ireland is a distinct legal
jurisdiction
, separate from the two other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom (
England and Wales
, and
Scotland
). Northern Ireland law developed from Irish law that existed before the
partition of Ireland
in 1921. Northern Ireland is a
common law
jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales. However, there are important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. The body of
statute law
affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the
Northern Ireland Assembly
, the former
Parliament of Northern Ireland
and the
Parliament of Ireland
, along with some Acts of the
Parliament of England
and of the
Parliament of Great Britain
that were extended to Ireland under
Poynings' Law
between 1494 and 1782.
Descriptions
Northern Ireland coast
There is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is: province, region, country or something else.
[14]
[15]
[16]
The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences.
[15]
This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution.
[14]
[15]
[16]
Owing in part to how the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, came into being, there is no legally defined term to describe what Northern Ireland 'is'. There is also no uniform or guiding way to refer to Northern Ireland amongst the agencies of the UK Government. For example, the websites of the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
[104]
and the
UK Statistics Authority
describe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these being Northern Ireland.
[105]
Other pages on the same websites refer to Northern Ireland specifically as a "province" as do publications of the UK Statistics Authority.
[106]
[107]
The website of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency also refers to Northern Ireland as being a province
[108]
as does the website of the Office of Public Sector Information
[109]
and other agencies within Northern Ireland.
[110]
Publications of
HM Treasury
[111]
and the Department of Finance and Personnel of the Northern Ireland Executive,
[112]
on the other hand, describe Northern Ireland as being a "region of the UK". The UK's submission to the 2007
United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names
defines the UK as being made up of two countries (England and Scotland), one
principality
(Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland).
[113]
Unlike England, Scotland, and Wales, Northern Ireland has no history of being an independent country or of being a nation in its own right.
[114]
Some writers describe the United Kingdom as being made up of three countries and one province
[115]
or point out the difficulties with calling Northern Ireland a country.
[116]
Authors writing specifically about Northern Ireland dismiss the idea that Northern Ireland is a "country" in general terms,
[14]
[16]
[117]
and draw contrasts in this respect with England, Scotland and Wales.
[118]
Even for the period covering the first 50 years of Northern Ireland's existence, the term
country
is considered inappropriate by some political scientists on the basis that many decisions were still made in London.
[114]
The absence of a distinct nation of Northern Ireland, separate within the island of Ireland, is also pointed out as being a problem with using the term
[16]
[119]
[120]
and is in contrast to England, Scotland, and Wales.
[121]
Many commentators prefer to use the term "province", although that is also not without problems. It can arouse irritation, particularly among nationalists, for whom the title province is properly reserved for the traditional province of Ulster, of which Northern Ireland comprises six out of nine counties.
[15]
[116]
The BBC style guide is to refer to Northern Ireland as a province, and use of the term is common in literature and newspaper reports on Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Some authors have described the meaning of this term as being equivocal: referring to Northern Ireland as being a province both of the United Kingdom and the traditional country of Ireland.
[119]
"Region" is used by several UK government agencies and the European Union. Some authors choose this word but note that it is "unsatisfactory".
[15]
[16]
Northern Ireland can also be simply described as "part of the UK", including by the UK government offices.
[104]
Alternative names
Main article:
Alternative names for Northern Ireland
Victoria Square Shopping Centre
in Belfast
Many people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second-largest city should be called
"Derry" or "Londonderry"
.
Choice of language and
nomenclature
in Northern Ireland often reveals the cultural, ethnic, and religious identity of the speaker. Those who do not belong to any group but lean towards one side often tend to use the language of that group. Supporters of unionism in the British media (notably
The Daily Telegraph
and the
Daily Express
) regularly call Northern Ireland "Ulster".
[122]
Many media outlets in the Republic use "North of Ireland" (or simply "the North"),
[123]
[124]
[125]
[126]
[127]
as well as the "Six Counties".
[128]
The New York Times
has also used "the North".
[129]
Government and cultural organisations in Northern Ireland often use the word "Ulster" in their title; for example, the
University of Ulster
, the
Ulster Museum
, the
Ulster Orchestra
, and
BBC Radio Ulster
.
Although some news bulletins since the 1990s have opted to avoid all contentious terms and use the official name, Northern Ireland, the term "the North" remains commonly used by broadcast media in the Republic.
[123]
[124]
[125]
Unionist
Ulster
, strictly speaking, refers to the province of
Ulster
, of which six of nine historical counties are in Northern Ireland. The term "Ulster" is widely used by unionists and the British press as shorthand for Northern Ireland, and is also favoured by
Ulster nationalists
.
[a]
In the past, calls have been made for Northern Ireland's name to be changed to Ulster. This proposal was formally considered by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1937 and by the UK Government in 1949 but no change was made.
[130]
The Province
refers to the historic Irish province of Ulster but today is used by some as shorthand for Northern Ireland. The
BBC
, in its editorial guidance for
Reporting the United Kingdom
, states that "the Province" is an appropriate secondary synonym for Northern Ireland, while "Ulster" is not. It also suggests that "people of Northern Ireland" is preferred to "British" or "Irish", and the term "mainland" should be avoided in reporting about Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
[131]
Nationalist
North of Ireland
- used to avoid using the name given by the British-enacted Government of Ireland Act 1920.
The Six Counties
(
na Sé Chontae
) - the Republic of Ireland is similarly described as the Twenty-Six Counties.
[132]
Some of the users of these terms contend that using the official name of the region would imply acceptance of the legitimacy of the Government of Ireland Act.
The Occupied Six Counties
- used by some republicans.
[133]
The Republic, whose legitimacy is similarly not recognised by republicans opposed to the Belfast Agreement, is described as the "Free State", referring to the
Irish Free State
, which gained independence (as a
Dominion
) in 1922.
[134]
British-Occupied Ireland
- Similar in tone to the Occupied Six Counties,
[135]
this term is used by more dogmatic republicans, such as
Republican Sinn Féin
,
[136]
who still hold that the
Second Dáil
was the last legitimate government of Ireland and that all governments since have been foreign-imposed usurpations of Irish national self-determination.
[137]
Other
Norn Iron
or "Norniron" - is an informal and affectionate
[138]
local nickname used to refer to Northern Ireland, derived from the pronunciation of the words "Northern Ireland" in an exaggerated Ulster accent (particularly one from the greater Belfast area). The phrase is seen as a lighthearted way to refer to Northern Ireland, based as it is on regional pronunciation. It often refers to the
Northern Ireland national football team
.

Geological history
The volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the geometric pillars of the
Giant's Causeway
on the north Antrim coast. Also in north Antrim are the
Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge
,
Mussenden Temple
and the
Glens of Antrim
.

Lough Erne
Northern Ireland was covered by an
ice sheet
for most of the
last ice age
and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of
drumlins
in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.
Major features
The centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is
Lough Neagh
, at 151 square miles (391 km
2
) the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the
British Isles
. A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper
Lough Erne
in Fermanagh. The largest island of Northern Ireland is
Rathlin
, off the north Antrim coast.
Strangford Lough
is the largest inlet in the British Isles, covering 150 km
2
(58 sq mi).
Slieve Donard,
Mourne Mountains
There are substantial uplands in the
Sperrin Mountains
(an extension of the
Caledonian mountain belt
) with extensive gold deposits, the
granite
Mourne Mountains
and the
basalt
Antrim Plateau
, as well as smaller ranges in
South Armagh
and along the Fermanagh-Tyrone border. None of the hills are especially high, with
Slieve Donard
in the dramatic Mournes reaching 850 metres (2,789 ft), Northern Ireland's highest point. Belfast's most prominent peak is
Cavehill
.
Marble Arch Caves
The Lower and Upper
River Bann
,
River Foyle
and
River Blackwater
form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent
arable land
also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry. The valley of the
River Lagan
is dominated by Belfast, whose metropolitan area includes over a third of the population of Northern Ireland, with heavy urbanisation and industrialisation along the Lagan Valley and both shores of
Belfast Lough
.
Climate
The vast majority of Northern Ireland has a
temperate maritime climate
, (
Cfb
in the
Köppen climate classification
) rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is very common across the region. The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5 °C (43.7 °F) in January and 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) in July. The highest maximum temperature recorded was 31.4 °C (88.5 °F), registered in July 2021 at
Armagh Observatory's
weather station.
[140]
The lowest minimum temperature recorded was −18.7 °C (−1.7 °F) at
Castlederg
,
County Tyrone
on 23 December 2010.
[141]
Flora and fauna
Flora and afforestation
Until the end of the
Middle Ages
, the land was heavily forested. Native species include
deciduous
trees such as
oak
,
ash
,
hazel
,
birch
,
alder
,
willow
,
aspen
,
elm
,
rowan
and
hawthorn
, as well as
evergreen
trees such
Scots pine
,
yew
and
holly
.
[142]
Today, only 8% of Northern Ireland is woodland, and most of this is non-native
conifer
plantations
.
[143]
As of the 21st century, Northern Ireland is the least forested part of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and one of the least forested countries in Europe.
[144]
Fauna
The only native reptile in Northern Ireland is the
viviparous lizard
, or common lizard, which is widely distributed, particularly in heaths, bogs and sand dunes. The
common frog
is a very widespread species. Some lakes support internationally important bird populations,
Lough Neagh
and
Lough Beg
hold up to 80,000 wintering waterfowl of some 20 species, including
ducks
,
geese
,
swans
and
gulls
. The
otter
is the fourth largest land mammal in Northern Ireland. It can be found along the river systems, although it is seldom seen and will avoid contact with humans.
[145]
356 species of marine
algae
have been recorded in the northeast of Ireland; 77 species are considered rare.
[146]
Counties
Main article:
Counties of Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland consists of six historic
counties
:
County Antrim
,
County Armagh
,
County Down
,
County Fermanagh
,
County Londonderry
,
[b]
and
County Tyrone
.
These counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead, there are eleven
districts of Northern Ireland
which have different geographical extents. These were created in 2015, replacing the twenty-six districts which previously existed.
[147]
Although counties are no longer used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an
Irish passport
, which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of that county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The
Gaelic Athletic Association
still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each
GAA county
. The original system of
car registration numbers
largely based on counties remains in use. In 2000, the
telephone numbering system
was restructured into an 8-digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.
The county boundaries still appear on Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Maps and the Philip's Street Atlases, among others. With their decline in official use, there is often confusion surrounding towns and cities which lie near county boundaries, such as Belfast and
Lisburn
, which are split between counties Down and Antrim (the majorities of both cities, however, are in Antrim).
In March 2018,
The Sunday Times
published its list of Best Places to Live in Britain, including the following places in Northern Ireland:
Ballyhackamore
near Belfast (overall best for Northern Ireland), Holywood, County Down, Newcastle, County Down, Portrush, County Antrim, Strangford, County Down.

Northern Ireland traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably featuring shipbuilding, rope manufacture, and textiles. In 2019, 53% of GVA was generated by services, 22% by the public sector, 15% by production, 8% by construction and 2% by agriculture.
[151]
Technology
Belfast is the United Kingdom's second largest tech hub outside of London with more than 25% of their jobs being technology related. Many established multinational tech companies such as Fujitsu, SAP, IBM and Microsoft have a presence here. It is regarded an appealing place to live for tech professionals and has a low cost of living compared to other cities.
[152]
[153]
Tourism
In 2019 Northern Ireland welcomed 5.3m visitors, who spent over £1billion. A total of 167 cruise ships docked at Northern Ireland ports in 2019.
[154]
Tourism in recent years has been a major growth area with key attractions including the Giants Causeway and the many castles in the region with the historic towns and cities of Belfast, Derry, Armagh and Enniskillen being popular with tourists. Entertainment venues include the SSE Arena, Waterfront Hall, the Grand Opera House and Custom House Square. Tourists use various means of transport around Northern Ireland such as vehicle hire, guided tours, taxi tours, electric bikes, electric cars and public transport.
[155]
Shipbuilding
Belfast currently has an 81-acre shipyard which was purposely developed to be able to take some of the world's largest vessels. It has the largest dry dock for ships in Europe measuring 556m x 93m and has 106m high cranes, it is ideally situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.
[156]
The shipyard can build ships and complete maintenance contracts such as the contracts awarded by P&O and Cunard cruise ships in 2022.
[157]
Agriculture
Northern Ireland feeds around 10 million people when their population is only 1.8 million.
[158]
The predominant activity on Northern Ireland farms in 2022 was cattle & sheep. 79 per cent of farms in Northern Ireland have some cattle, 38 per cent have some sheep. Over three quarters of farms in Northern Ireland are very small, in 2022 there were 26,089 farms in Northern Ireland with approximately one million hectares of land farmed.
[159]
Dual-market access
Northern Ireland is in a unique position where it can sell goods to the rest of the United Kingdom and the European Union tariff-free, free from customs declarations, rules of origin certificates and non-tariff barriers on the sale of goods to both regions.

Antrim
,
George Best Belfast City
integrated into the railway network at
Sydenham
in East Belfast, and
City of Derry
in County Londonderry. There are upgrade plans to transform the railway network in Northern Ireland including new lines from Derry to Portadown and Belfast to Newry, though it will take the best part of 25 years to deliver.
[163]
There are major seaports at
Larne
and
Belfast
which carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Passenger railways are operated by
Northern Ireland Railways
. With
Iarnród Éireann
(Irish Rail),
Northern Ireland Railways
co-operates in providing the joint
Enterprise
service between
Dublin Connolly
and
Lanyon Place
. The whole of Ireland has a mainline railway network with a
gauge of 5 ft 3 in (1,600 mm)
, which is unique in Europe and has resulted in distinct rolling stock designs. The only preserved line of this gauge on the island is the
Downpatrick and County Down Railway
, which operates heritage steam and diesel locomotives. Main railway lines linking to and from
Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station
and Lanyon Place railway station are:
The
Derry Line
and the Portrush Branch.
The Larne Line
The Bangor Line
The

The Derry line is the busiest single track railway line in the United Kingdom, carrying 3 million passengers per annum, the Derry-Londonderry Line has also been described by Michael Palin as "one of the most beautiful rail journeys in the world".
[164]
Main motorways are:

Several studies and surveys carried out between 1971 and 2006 have indicated that, in general, most Protestants in Northern Ireland see themselves primarily as British, whereas most Catholics see themselves primarily as Irish.

[187]

[191]
This does not, however, account for the
complex identities within Northern Ireland
, given that many of the population regard themselves as "Ulster" or "Northern Irish", either as a primary or secondary identity.
A 2008 survey found that 57% of Protestants described themselves as British, while 32% identified as Northern Irish, 6% as Ulster, and 4% as Irish. Compared to a similar survey in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish. The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British, and 1% as Ulster. These figures were largely unchanged from the 1998 results.

People born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be
citizens of the United Kingdom
. They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be
citizens of Ireland
. This entitlement was reaffirmed in the 1998
Good Friday Agreement
between the British and Irish governments, which provides that:
...it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly [the two governments] confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.
2011: Map of most commonly held passport
As a result of the Agreement, the
Constitution of the Republic of Ireland
was amended. The current wording provides that people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to be Irish citizens on the same basis as people from any other part of the island.
[194]
Neither government, however, extends its citizenship to all persons born in Northern Ireland. Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen. The Irish restriction was given effect by the
twenty-seventh amendment to the Irish Constitution
in 2004. The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose. Renunciation of British citizenship requires the payment of a fee, currently £372.

Languages of Northern Ireland
Irish is an official language of Northern Ireland as of 6 December 2022 when the Irish Language Act (
Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022
) became law. The Irish Language Act officially repealed legislation from 1737 that banned the use of Irish in courts.

English is also spoken as a first language by 95.4% of the Northern Ireland population.

. South to north, the colour bands represent
Hiberno-English

areas. The Irish-speaking

Under the
Good Friday Agreement
, Irish and
Ulster Scots
(an Ulster dialect of the
Scots language
, sometimes known as
Ullans
), are recognised as "part of the cultural wealth of Northern Ireland".
[198]
The Irish Language Act of 2022 also legislated commissioners for both Irish and Ulster Scots.
[1]
Two all-island bodies for the promotion of these were created under the Agreement:
Foras na Gaeilge
, which promotes the Irish language, and the
Ulster Scots Agency
, which promotes the Ulster-Scots dialect and culture. These operate separately under the aegis of
the North/South Language Body
, which reports to the
North/South Ministerial Council
.
The
UK Government
in 2001 ratified the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings about education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities, and other matters. A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster-Scots, under Part II of the Charter.

English
Main article:
Ulster English
According to the 2021 census, in 94.74% of households, all people aged 16 and above spoke English as their main language.
[200]
The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland
Scots language
.
[201]
There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, for instance; the name of the letter
h
, which Protestants tend to pronounce as "aitch", as in
British English
, and Catholics tend to pronounce as "haitch", as in
Hiberno-English
.
[202]
However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.
Irish
Percentage of people aged 3+ claiming to have some ability in Irish in the
2011 census
Main articles:
Irish language in Northern Ireland
and
Ulster Irish
The Irish language (
Irish
:
an Ghaeilge
), or
Gaelic
, is the second most spoken language in Northern Ireland and is a native language of Ireland.
[203]
It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the
Ulster Plantations
in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are
anglicised
versions of a Gaelic name. Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics). However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the
Gaelic revival
.
[204]
In the 2021 census, 12.4% (compared with 10.7% in 2011) of the population of Northern Ireland claimed "some knowledge of Irish" and 3.9% (compared with 3.7% in 2011) reported being able to "speak, read, write and understand" Irish.
[166]
[197]
In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.
[205]
The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish, has two main types, East Ulster Irish and Donegal Irish (or West Ulster Irish),
[206]
is the one closest to
Scottish Gaelic
(which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster - those of
Rathlin Island
and the
Glens of Antrim
- were very similar to the dialect of
Argyll
, the part of Scotland nearest to Ireland. And those dialects of Armagh and Down were also very similar to the dialects of Galloway.
The use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland today is politically sensitive. The erection by some
district councils
of bilingual street names in both English and Irish,
[207]
invariably in predominantly nationalist districts, is resisted by unionists who claim that it creates a "chill factor" and thus harms community relationships. Efforts by members of the
Northern Ireland Assembly
to legislate for some official uses of the language have failed to achieve the required cross-community support. In May 2022, the UK Government proposed a bill in the House of Lords to make Irish an official language (and support Ulster Scots) in Northern Ireland and to create an Irish Language Commissioner.
[208]
[209]
The bill has since been passed, and received royal assent in December 2022.
[210]
There has recently been an increase in interest in the language among unionists in East Belfast.
[211]
Ulster Scots
Percentage of people aged 3+ claiming to have some ability in Ulster Scots in the 2011 census
Main article:
Ulster Scots dialect
Ulster Scots comprises varieties of the
Scots language
spoken in Northern Ireland. For a native English speaker, "[Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary."
[212]
Along with the Irish language, the Good Friday Agreement recognised the dialect as part of Northern Ireland's unique culture and the
St Andrews Agreement
recognised the need to "enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture".
[213]
At the time of the 2021 census, approximately 1.1% (compared to 0.9% in 2011) of the population claimed to be able to speak, read, write and understand Ulster-Scots, while 10.4% (compared to 8.1% in 2011) professed to have "some ability".

Sign languages
Main articles:
Northern Ireland Sign Language
,
Irish Sign Language
, and
British Sign Language
The most common
sign language
in Northern Ireland is
Northern Ireland Sign Language
(NISL). However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin
[
citation needed
]
where
Irish Sign Language
(ISL) is commonly used, ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.
Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes
American Sign Language
(ASL). NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes
Auslan
) with many borrowings from ASL. It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the
syntactic
level while much of the
lexicon
is based on
British Sign Language
(BSL).
[214]
As of March 2004
the
UK Government
recognises only British Sign Language and Irish Sign Language as the official sign languages used in Northern Ireland.

Culture

Culture of Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland shares both the
culture of Ulster
and the
culture of the United Kingdom
.

Northern Ireland has witnessed rising numbers of tourists. Attractions include concert venues, cultural festivals, musical and artistic traditions, countryside and geographical sites of interest, public houses, welcoming hospitality, and sports (especially golf and fishing).
[217]
Since 1987 public houses have been allowed to open on Sundays, despite some opposition.
Parades are a prominent feature
of Northern Ireland society,
[218]
more so than in the rest of Ireland or the United Kingdom. Most are held by Protestant fraternities such as the
Orange Order
, and Ulster loyalist marching bands. Each summer, during the "marching season", these groups have hundreds of parades,
deck streets with British flags
, bunting and specially-made arches, and light large towering bonfires in the
"Eleventh Night" celebrations
.
[219]
The biggest parades are held on 12 July (
The Twelfth
). There is often tension when these activities take place near Catholic neighbourhoods, which sometimes leads to violence.
[220]
The
Ulster Cycle
is a large body of prose and verse centring on the traditional heroes of the
Ulaid
in what is now eastern Ulster. This is one of the four major cycles of
Irish mythology
. The cycle centres on the reign of
Conchobar mac Nessa
, who is said to have been the king of Ulster around the 1st century. He ruled from
Emain Macha
(now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen
Medb
and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally,
Fergus mac Róich
, former king of Ulster. The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew
Cúchulainn
, who features in the
epic prose/poem
An
Táin Bó Cúailnge
(The Cattle Raid of Cooley, a
casus belli
between Ulster and
Connaught
).

The
Ulster Banner
is used to represent Northern Ireland in
association football
and at the
Commonwealth Games
.
Northern Ireland comprises a patchwork of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts. The
Union Jack
and the former
Northern Ireland flag
are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the
flag of Ireland
in 1916,
[222]
is flown in some republican areas. Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies.
[223]
The official flag is that of the state having sovereignty over the territory, i.e. the Union Flag.
[224]
The former Northern Ireland flag, also known as the "
Ulster Banner
" or "Red Hand Flag", is a banner derived from the coat of arms of the
Government of Northern Ireland
until 1972. Since 1972, it has had no official status. The Union Flag and the Ulster Banner are used exclusively by unionists. The UK flags policy states that in Northern Ireland, "The Ulster flag and the
Cross of St Patrick
have no official status and, under the Flags Regulations, are not permitted to be flown from Government Buildings."
[225]
[226]
The
Irish Rugby Football Union
and the
Church of Ireland
have used the
Saint Patrick's Saltire
or "Cross of St Patrick". This red
saltire
on a white field was used to represent Ireland in the
flag of the United Kingdom
. It is still used by some
British Army
regiments. Foreign flags are also found, such as the
Palestinian
flags in some nationalist areas and
Israeli
flags in some unionist areas.
[227]
The United Kingdom national anthem of "
God Save the King
" is often played at state events in Northern Ireland. At the
Commonwealth Games
and some other sporting events, the Northern Ireland team uses the Ulster Banner as its flag—notwithstanding its lack of official status—and the
Londonderry Air
(usually set to
lyrics
as
Danny Boy
), which also has no official status, as its
national anthem
.
[228]
[229]
The
Northern Ireland national football team
also uses the Ulster Banner as its flag but uses "God Save The King" as its anthem.
[230]
Major
Gaelic Athletic Association
matches are opened by the national anthem of the Republic of Ireland, "
Amhrán na bhFiann
(The Soldier's Song)", which is also used by most other all-Ireland sporting organisations.
[231]
Since 1995, the
Ireland rugby union team
has used a specially commissioned song, "
Ireland's Call
" as the team's anthem. The Irish national anthem is also played at Dublin home matches, being the anthem of the host country.

Northern Irish murals
have become well-known features of Northern Ireland, depicting past and present events and documenting peace and cultural diversity. Almost 2,000 murals have been documented in Northern Ireland since the 1970s.

The
Daly Range
or
Daly Mountains
(
Danish
:
Daly Bjerge
) is a
mountain range
in
Peary Land
, Northern
Greenland
. Administratively this range is part of the
Northeast Greenland National Park
.
It forms the eastern end of the northernmost mountain range on Earth.
[1]
The area of the range is barren and uninhabited.
History
[
edit
]
The mountain chain was named by
Robert Peary
after Judge
Charles P. Daly
, President of the
American Geographical Society
and member of the executive committee of the
Peary Arctic Club
in
New York
.
[2]
In 1900 Peary saw the range from the coast and was the first to put it on the map. The Daly Range was further surveyed in 1907 by
Johan Peter Koch
,
Aage Bertelsen
and
Tobias Gabrielsen
, the northern team of the ill-fated
Denmark expedition
, when they reached their northernmost point,
Cape Bridgman
.
[3]
Aerial surveys by
Lauge Koch
in 1930 during the
Three-year Expedition to East Greenland
mapped the area with higher precision.
[4]
Still, the Daly Range remained very little explored until July 2000, when members of the
American Alpine Club
made an attempt to climb the highest point up the Bertelsen Glacier to the base of the peak. This attempt, however, was thwarted by awful weather conditions and the mountain remained unclimbed until July 2003 when four alpinists led by
Dennis Schmitt
were able to reach the highest point of the range from the Moore Glacier.
[5]
Geography
[
edit
]
The Daly Range is the easternmost subrange of the
Roosevelt Range
.
[6]
Its highest peak rises above the confluence of the
Moore Glacier
and the
Bertelsen Glacier
.
[7]
It is a prominent 1,399 m (4,590 ft) high summit covered by an
ice cap
—Schmitt gives a height of 1,456 m (4,777 ft) that contradicts the height on maps.
[5]
This mountain chain runs roughly from WNW to ESE at the eastern end of
Johannes V. Jensen Land
southeast of
Bliss Bay
in the
Wandel Sea
, SW of Cape Bridgman and north of the mouth area of
Frederick E. Hyde Fjord
, rising steeply above the coastal plain.
[8]
The
H. H. Benedict Range
(H. H. Benedict Bjerge)
rises to the west and southwest, beyond the Moore Glacier.

Château Marquis d'Alesme Becker
is a
winery
in the
Margaux
appellation
of the
Bordeaux wine
region of
France
. The wine produced here was classified as one of fourteen
Troisièmes Crus
(Third Growths) in the historic
Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855
.
[1]
The estate produces a
second wine
named Marquise d'Alesme.
History
[
edit
]
Established by the Marquis d'Alesme in 1585, the estate was originally planted in 1616.
[2]
[3]
The property was acquired in 1809 by the
Dutch
business man
Jan Bekker Teerlink
(1759-1832), commonly referred to as ‘Monsieur Becker’ (the misspelled first part of his
double-barrelled
family name), who attached his name to that of the estate, and for a period the wine was called simply "Becker" in Bordeaux.
[2]
[4]
In the early 20th Century, the property was bought by Comte Jean-Jules Théophile Chaix-d'Est-Ange, who had also inherited neighbouring
Château Lascombes
from his father, who intended to combine the two estates, but died in 1923 before carrying out the plan.
[3]
[4]
The original Marquis d'Alesme
château
became offices for Lascombes, with the original château of
Desmirail
taking its place.
[2]
The estate saw a succession of owners, including English firm WH Chaplin & Co and the Zuger family, until it was sold in 2006 to petrochemical industry businessman
Hubert Perrodo
. Apparently with elaborate plans of combining several of his Margaux estates, no changes took place after Perrodo was killed in a skiing accident in late 2006.
[3]
The estate is currently run by Nathalie Perrodo.
Production
[
edit
]
The vineyard area consists of 16 hectares (40 acres) of vines, currently planted with 30%
Cabernet Sauvignon
, 45%
Merlot
, 15%
Cabernet Franc
and 10%
Petit Verdot
, an unusual composition of grape varieties for Margaux or the
Médoc
.
[3]
Approximately 8000 cases of the
Grand vin
is produced per year, and 1000 cases of the second wine, Marquise d'Alesme.

Bâtiment 7
is a space of 90,000 square foot in
Montreal
in the
Quebec
province in Canada, converted into a shared community space, in the
Pointe Saint-Charles
suburb of Montreal.
[1]
[2]
It is located on the previous plot of real estate owned by the train company
Canadian National Railway
(CN).
In 2003, a group of persons living in Pointe Saint-Charles planted a symbolic flag on the terrain that hosted old workshops CN.
[1]
The popular movement was to demand adapted facilities on the lot for the neighbourhood. Two years after the start of the campaign, CN transferred the lot for a symbolic C$1 to Groupe Mach, a real estate entity
[3]
that was to facilitate movement of
Casino de Montréal
to the area  financed jointly by
Loto Québec
and
Cirque du Soleil
.
[4]
An important protest was mobilised by various community associations and after 14 years of activism was able to take legal possession of the plot in 2016.
[5]
Decontamination efforts were pursued and in May 2018, Bâtiment 7 opened its doors.
[6]
The struggle for the development of the area resulted in the citizens acquiring further space around the facility for community use in 2021.
[7]
Bâtiment 7 is a complex run independently by the collective "7 à Nous".
[3]
It included various projects
[8]
like Le Détour fruits, vegetables and food store run by volunteers,
[2]
in an area in need of affordable priced food, also Sans-Taverne, a home beer cooperative that distributes beers and alcoholic products in more than 100 locations and bars. The complex also includes the cooperative Press Start that organizes lectures and debates in public gatherings of youth between 14 and 21 years and La Coulée, a solidarity collective teaching various skills including metallurgy. Other collaborative services include preparing cadres of auto and bicycle mechanics, carpentry, silk-screen printing, work on ceramics and photography. Other planned projects include a collaborative culinary space, child birth aid, a nursery and autonomous works.

Creative COW
was founded in April 2001 by Kathlyn and Ron Lindeboom,
[6]
a married couple.
[7]
The website evolved from the Lindeboom's earlier
Media 100 Worldwide Users Group
(WWUG),
[5]
which began in  1995, and was sold to Digital Media Net in January 2000.
[7]
After the sale of WWUG, the Lindebooms decided to create another website. Initially, Kathlyn Lindeboom was Creative COW's director and chief officer, while Ron shifted roles from a
developer
to operations. In late 2002, Ron took over as the company's
CEO
, while Kathlyn shifted to
operations
and
Human Resources
.

Millennials
, while 25% (1.9 million annual visitors) were mid-career professionals.
[9]
In 2022, Creative COW LLC was dissolved
[10]
and Creative COW's trademarks, assets, and intellectual property were reassigned from Ronald Lindeboom to Brielyn Clayton.

USS
Washington
was a
schooner
acquired by the
Continental Navy
during the
American Revolution
and converted to an armed
brigantine
. She served for only a short period of time before being captured by the British.
Acquired by General Washington
[
edit
]
The first ship to be named
Washington
by the Navy—while never part of the Continental Navy—was a 160-ton schooner named
Endeavor
acquired by General
George Washington
in early October 1775 from George Erving and Capt. Benjamin Wormwell of
Plymouth, Massachusetts
.
Renamed
Washington
, the schooner was fitted out at Plymouth, Massachusetts, and was re-rigged as a brigantine at the behest of her prospective commanding officer, a
Continental Army
officer from
Rhode Island
, Capt. Sion Martindale. On November 3, 1775, Washington's charter was consummated, and she was authorized to operate off the New England coast between
Cape Cod
and
Cape Ann
in the hope of disrupting British shipping.
Service
[
edit
]
Washington
sailed in company with the schooner
Harrison
on November 23. No more than three
leagues
from shore, both Continental ships came across the British frigate
HMS
Tartar
and two forage-laden transports. The British ships scared off and separated and
Washington
and
Harrison
chased the ship until well after nightfall. And, although
Washington
spent most of November 25 looking for
Harrison
, she did not find her.
Soon thereafter, she captured the provision-laden, 80-ton sloop
Britannia
and turned her over to Continental authorities before returning to sea on the 28th. However, stormy weather and a poorly disciplined crew caused
Washington
to head back to port the next day.
A demoralized crew
[
edit
]
Back at Plymouth, it was ascertained that some of the men's grumblings had been occasioned by their contention that they had enlisted to serve as soldiers in the army, not as sailors. Moreover, a lack of winter clothing demoralized the crew. They were quickly supplied with suitable winter outfits, and the ship returned to sea on Sunday, December 3, 1775.
Captured
[
edit
]
Late the next day, the British 6th rate, 20-gun frigate
HMS
Fowey
, cruising
Massachusetts Bay
on the lookout for "rebel cruisers," in company with
HMS
Lively
, sighted
Washington
and gave chase.
Just before nightfall,
Fowey
reached gun range and fired a warning shot. Seven subsequent rounds brought the brigantine to, and she lowered her colors. Taken to
Boston
, Massachusetts,
Washington
, upon inspection by the
Royal Navy
, was deemed unsuitable for British operations on the high seas.
Final disposition
[
edit
]
The brigantine
Washington
eventually rotted away at Boston.

[13]
to defeat the
Sultan of Delhi
,
Ibrahim Lodi
, in the
First Battle of Panipat
, and to sweep down the plains of
North India
. The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson,
Akbar
.
[14]
This imperial structure lasted until 1720, until shortly after the death of the last major emperor,
Aurangzeb
,
[15]
[16]
during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent. Reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1760, the empire was formally dissolved by the
British Raj
after the
Indian Rebellion of 1857
.
Although the Mughal Empire was created and sustained by military warfare,
[17]
[18]
[19]
it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule; rather it equalized and placated them through new administrative practices,
[20]
[21]
and diverse ruling elites, leading to more efficient, centralised, and standardized rule.
[22]
The base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar.
[23]
[24]
These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator,
[25]
were paid in the well-regulated silver currency,
[22]
and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.
[26]
The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion.
[27]
The burgeoning European presence in the Indian Ocean and an increasing demand for Indian raw and finished products generated much wealth for the Mughal court.
[28]
There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite,
[29]
resulting in greater patronage of
painting
, literary forms, textiles, and
architecture
, especially during the reign of
Shah Jahan
.
[30]
Among the Mughal
UNESCO World Heritage Sites
in South Asia are:
Agra Fort
,
Fatehpur Sikri
,
Red Fort
,
Humayun's Tomb
,
Lahore Fort
,
Shalamar Gardens
, and the
Taj Mahal
, which is described as "the jewel of Muslim art in India, and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."
[31]
Name
The closest to an official name for the empire was
Hindustan
, which was documented in the
Ain-i-Akbari
.
[32]
Mughal administrative records also refer to the empire as "Land of Hindustan"
(
Persian
:
بِلادِ هِندوستان
,
romanized
:
Bilād-i-Hindustān
)
, "Dominions of Hindustan"
(
Persian
:
وِلايَتِ هِندوستان
,
romanized
:
Wilāyat-i-Hindustān
)
,
[33]
or "Sultanate of Al-Hind"
(
Arabic
: سلطنة الهندية, Saltanat(i) Al-Hindiyyah)
as observed in the epithet of emperor
Aurangzeb
.
[34]
The contemporary
Qing
chronicles referred to the Mughal emperors as the "Lords of Hindustan"
(
Mandarin
: Undustan i noyan)
.
[35]
In the west, the term "
Mughal
" was used for the emperor, and by extension, the empire as a whole.
[36]
The Mughal designation for their own dynasty was
Gurkani
(
Persian
:
گورکانیان
,
romanized
:
Gūrkāniyān
,
lit.
'sons-in-law')
.
[37]
The use of "Mughal" and "Moghul" derived from the
Arabic
and
Persian
corruption of "
Mongol
", and it emphasised the Mongol origins of the Timurid dynasty.
[38]
The term gained currency during the 19th century, but remains disputed by
Indologists
.
[39]
Similar transliterations had been used to refer to the empire, including "Mogul" and "Moghul".
[40]
[41]
Nevertheless, Babur's ancestors were sharply distinguished from the classical Mongols insofar as they were oriented towards
Persian
rather than
Turco-Mongol
culture. The Mughals themselves claimed ultimate descent from the founder of the Mongol Empire,
Genghis Khan
.
[42]
History
Main article:
Mughal dynasty
Babur and Humayun (1526-1556)
Main articles:
Babur
and
Humayun
India in 1525 just before the onset of Mughal rule
The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526-1530), a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the
Turco-Mongol
conqueror
Timur
(the founder of the
Timurid Empire
) on his father's side, and from
Genghis Khan
on his mother's side.
[43]
Paternally, Babur belonged to the
Turkicized
Barlas
tribe of
Mongol
origin.
[44]
Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions.
[45]
He established himself in
Kabul
and then pushed steadily southward into India from
Afghanistan
through the
Khyber Pass
.
[43]
Babur's forces defeated
Ibrahim Lodi
in the
First Battle of Panipat
in 1526. Before the battle, Babur sought divine favour by abjuring liquor, breaking the wine vessels and pouring the wine down a well.
However, by this time
Lodi's empire
was already crumbling, and it was actually the
Rajput
Confederacy which was the strongest power of Northern India under the capable rule of
Rana Sanga
of
Mewar
. He defeated Babur in the
Battle of Bayana
.
[46]
However, in the decisive
Battle of Khanwa
which was fought near Agra, the Timurid forces of Babur defeated the Rajput army of Sanga. This battle was one of the most decisive and historic battles in Indian history, as it sealed the fate of Northern India for the next two centuries.
After the battle, the centre of Mughal power became Agra instead of Kabul. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.
[47]
The instability of the empire became evident under his son,
Humayun
(reigned 1530-1556), who was forced into exile in Persia by rebels. The
Sur Empire
(1540-1555), founded by
Sher Shah Suri
(reigned 1540-1545), briefly interrupted Mughal rule.
[43]
Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the
Safavid
and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing Persian cultural influence in the later restored Mughal Empire.

Humayun's triumphant return from Persia in 1555 restored Mughal rule in some parts of India, but he died in an accident the next year.

Akbar
(reigned 1556-1605) was born Jalal-ud-din Muhammad
[48]
in the Rajput
Umarkot Fort
,
[49]
to Humayun and his wife
Hamida Banu Begum
, a
Persian
princess.
[50]
Akbar succeeded to the throne under a regent,
Bairam Khan
, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India. Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the
Godavari River
.
[

He created a new ruling elite loyal to him, implemented a modern administration, and encouraged cultural developments. He increased trade with European trading companies.
[43]
India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and economic development.
[

]
Akbar allowed freedom of religion at his court, and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion,
Din-i-Ilahi
, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult.
[43]
He left his son an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge.
[43]
Jahangir
(born Salim,
[51]
reigned 1605-1627) was born to Akbar and his wife
Mariam-uz-Zamani
, an Indian
Rajput
princess.
[52]
Salim was named after the Indian Sufi saint,
Salim Chishti
.
[53]
[54]
He "was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques".
[43]
Jahangir distinguished himself from Akbar by making substantial efforts to gain the support of the Islamic religious establishment. One way he did this was by bestowing many more
madad-i-ma'ash
(tax-free personal land revenue grants given to religiously learned or spiritually worthy individuals) than Akbar had.
[55]
In contrast to Akbar, Jahangir came into conflict with non-Muslim religious leaders, notably the
Sikh
guru
Arjan
, whose execution was the first of many conflicts between the Mughal empire and the Sikh community.

(reigned 1628-1658) was born to Jahangir and his wife
Jagat Gosain
, a Rajput princess.
[51]
His reign ushered in the golden age of
Mughal architecture
.
[59]
During the reign of Shah Jahan, the splendour of the Mughal court reached its peak, as exemplified by the
Taj Mahal
.The cost of maintaining the court, however, began to exceed the revenue coming in.
[43]
His reign was called as "The Golden Age of Mughal Architecture". Shah Jahan extended the Mughal empire to the Deccan by ending the Nizam Shahi dynasty, and forced the Adil Shahis and Qutb Shahis to pay tribute.
[60]
Shah Jahan's eldest son, the liberal
Dara Shikoh
, became regent in 1658, as a result of his father's illness.
[

]
Dara championed a syncretistic Hindu-Muslim culture, emulating his great-grandfather Akbar.
[61]
With the support of the Islamic orthodoxy, however, a younger son of Shah Jahan,
Aurangzeb
(
r.
1658-1707
), seized the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed.
[43]
Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb kept Shah Jahan imprisoned until his death in 1666.
[62]
: 68
Aurangzeb oversaw an increase in the Islamicization of the Mughal state. He encouraged conversion to Islam, reinstated the
jizya
on non-Muslims, and compiled the
Fatawa 'Alamgiri
, a collection of Islamic law. Aurangzeb also ordered the execution of the Sikh guru
Tegh Bahadur
, leading to the militarization of the Sikh community.
[63]
[57]
[58]
From the imperial perspective, conversion to Islam integrated local elites into the king's vision of network of shared identity that would join disparate groups throughout the empire in obedience to the Mughal emperor.
[64]
His
campaign to conquer South and Western India
nominally increased the size of Mughal Empire, but had a ruinous effect on Mughal Empire.
[65]
Matthew White estimates that about 2.5 million of Aurangzeb's army were killed during the
Mughal-Maratha Wars
(100,000 annually during a quarter-century), while 2 million civilians in war-torn lands died due to drought,
plague
and
famine
.
[66]
This campaign also had a ruinous effect on Mughal Treasury, and Emperor's absence led to a severe decline in Governance in Northern India.  Marathas started expanding northwards shortly after the death of Aurangzeb, defeated the Mughals in
Delhi
and
Bhopal
, and extended their empire up to
Peshawar
by 1758.
[67]
Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king,
[62]
with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society,
[43]
while other historians question this, noting that he built
Hindu temples
,
[68]
employed significantly more
Hindus
in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and
Shia Muslims
.
[62]
: 58
Despite these allegations, it has been acknowledged that Emperor Aurangzeh enacted repressive policies towards non-Muslims, which also resulted to a
major rebellion
by the
Marathas
.

[43]
as figureheads under the rule of a brotherhood of nobles belonging to the
Indian Muslim
caste known as the
Sadaat-e-Bara
, whose leaders, the
Sayyid Brothers
, became the de facto sovereigns of the empire.
[70]
[71]
During the reign of
Muhammad Shah
(reigned 1719-1748), the empire began to break up, and vast tracts of central India passed from Mughal to
Maratha
hands. As the Mughals tried to suppress the independence of the
Nizam
in the Deccan, he encouraged the Marathas to invade central and northern India.
[72]
[73]
[74]
The far-off
Indian campaign
of
Nader Shah
, who had previously reestablished Iranian
suzerainty
over most of West Asia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, culminated with the
Sack of Delhi
and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige. Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs, and broke away to form independent kingdoms.
[

]
But, according to
Sugata Bose
and
Ayesha Jalal
, the Mughal Emperor continued to be the highest manifestation of sovereignty. Not only the Muslim gentry, but the Maratha, Hindu, and Sikh leaders took part in ceremonial acknowledgments of the emperor as the sovereign of India.
[75]
Meanwhile, some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented Mughal Empire, involved themselves and the state in global conflicts, leading only to defeat and loss of territory during the
Carnatic Wars
and the
Bengal War
.
The remnants of the empire in 1751
The Mughal Emperor
Shah Alam II
(1759-1806) made futile attempts to reverse the Mughal decline but ultimately had to seek the protection of the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdali, which led to the
Third Battle of Panipat
between the Maratha Empire and the Afghans (led by Abdali) in 1761. In 1771, the Marathas recaptured Delhi from Afghan control and in 1784 they officially became the protectors of the emperor in Delhi,
[76]
a state of affairs that continued until the
Second Anglo-Maratha War
. Thereafter, the
British East India Company
became the protectors of the Mughal dynasty in Delhi.
[75]
The British East India
Company
took control of the former Mughal province of Bengal-Bihar in 1793 after it abolished local rule (Nizamat) that lasted until 1858, marking the beginning of British colonial era over the Indian subcontinent. By 1857 a considerable part of former Mughal India was under the East India Company's control. After a crushing defeat in the
war of 1857-1858
which he nominally led, the last Mughal,
Bahadur Shah Zafar
, was deposed by the British
East India Company
and exiled in 1858. Zafar was exiled to
Rangoon
, Burma.
[77]
His wife
Zeenat Mahal
and some of the remaining members of the family accompanied him. At 4 am on 7 October 1858, Zafar along with his wives, two remaining sons began his journey towards Rangoon in bullock carts escorted by
9th Lancers
under command of Lieutenant Ommaney.
[78]
Through the
Government of India Act 1858
the
British Crown
assumed direct control of East India Company-held territories in India in the form of the new
British Raj
. In 1876 the British
Queen Victoria
assumed the title of
Empress of India
.

Causes of decline
Historians have offered numerous explanations for the rapid collapse of the Mughal Empire between 1707 and 1720, after a century of growth and prosperity. In fiscal terms, the throne lost the revenues needed to pay its chief officers, the emirs (nobles) and their entourages. The emperor lost authority, as the widely scattered imperial officers lost confidence in the central authorities, and made their own deals with local men of influence. The imperial army, bogged down in long, futile wars against the more aggressive
Marathas
, lost its fighting spirit. Finally came a series of violent political feuds over control of the throne. After the execution of
Emperor Farrukhsiyar
in 1719, local Mughal successor states took power in region after region.
[79]
Contemporary chroniclers bewailed the decay they witnessed, a theme picked up by the first British historians who wanted to underscore the need for a British-led rejuvenation.
[80]
Modern views on the decline
Since the 1970s historians have taken multiple approaches to the decline, with little consensus on which factor was dominant. The psychological interpretations emphasise depravity in high places, excessive luxury, and increasingly narrow views that left the rulers unprepared for an external challenge. A Marxist school (led by
Irfan Habib
and based at
Aligarh Muslim University
) emphasises excessive exploitation of the peasantry by the rich, which stripped away the will and the means to support the regime.
[81]
Karen Leonard has focused on the failure of the regime to work with Hindu bankers, whose financial support was increasingly needed; the bankers then helped the Maratha and the British.
[82]
In a religious interpretation, some scholars argue that the Hindu powers revolted against the rule of a Muslim dynasty.
[83]
Finally, other scholars argue that the very prosperity of the Empire inspired the provinces to achieve a high degree of independence, thus weakening the imperial court.
[84]
Jeffrey G. Williamson
has argued that the
Indian economy
went through
deindustrialization
in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire, with
British rule
later causing further deindustrialization.
[85]
According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up
food prices
, then
nominal
wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior
factory technology
.
[86]
Indian textiles, however, still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century.
[87]
Administration and state
Main article:
Government of the Mughal Empire
India in 1605 and the end of emperor Akbar's reign; the map shows the different
subahs
, or provinces, of his administration
The Mughal Empire had a highly centralised, bureaucratic government, most of which was instituted during the rule of the third Mughal emperor Akbar.
[88]
[89]
The central government was headed by the Mughal emperor; immediately beneath him were four ministries. The finance/revenue ministry was responsible for controlling revenues from the empire's territories, calculating tax revenues, and using this information to distribute assignments. The ministry of the military (army/intelligence) was headed by an official titled
mir bakhshi
, who was in charge of military organisation, messenger service, and the
mansabdari
system. The ministry in charge of law/religious patronage was the responsibility of the
sadr as-sudr,
who appointed judges and managed charities and stipends. Another ministry was dedicated to the imperial household and public works.
[77]
[88]
Administrative divisions
The empire was divided into
Subah
(provinces), each of which were headed by a provincial governor called a
subadar
.
The structure of the central government was mirrored at the provincial level; each
suba
had its own
bakhshi
,
sadr as-sudr
, and finance minister that reported directly to the central government rather than the
subahdar
.
Subas
were subdivided into administrative units known as
sarkars
,
which were further divided into groups of villages known as
parganas
.
Mughal government in the
pargana
consisted of a Muslim judge and local tax collector.
[77]
[88]
Parganas
were the basic administrative unit of the Mughal empire.
[90]
Mughal administrative divisions were not static. Territories were often rearranged and reconstituted for better administrative control, and to extend cultivation. For example, a
sarkar
could turn into a
subah
, and
parganas
were often transferred between
sarkars
. The hierarchy of division was ambiguous sometimes, as a territory could fall under multiple overlapping jurisdictions. Administrative divisions were also vague in their geography - the Mughal state did not have enough resources or authority to undertake detailed land surveys, and hence the geographical limits of these divisions were not formalised and maps not created. The Mughals instead recorded detailed statistics about each division, in order to assess the territory's capacity for revenue, on the basis of simpler land surveys.
[91]
Capitals
The Mughals had multiple imperial capitals, established over the course of their rule. These were the cities of
Agra
,
Delhi
,
Lahore
, and
Fatehpur Sikri
. Power often shifted back and forth between these capitals.
[92]
Sometimes this was necessitated by political and military demands, but shifts also occurred for ideological reasons (for example, Akbar's establishment of Fatehpur Sikri), or even simply because the cost of establishing a new capital was marginal.
[93]
Situations where there were two simultaneous capitals happened multiple times in Mughal history. Certain cities also served as short-term, provincial capitals, as was the case with Aurangzeb's shift to
Aurangabad
in the
Deccan
.
[92]
Kabul
was the
summer capital
of Mughals from 1526 to 1681.
[94]
The imperial camp, used for military expeditions and royal tours, also served as a kind of mobile, "de facto" administrative capital. From the time of Akbar, Mughal camps were huge in scale, accompanied by numerous personages associated with the royal court, as well as soldiers and labourers. All administration and governance was carried out within them. The Mughal Emperors spent a significant portion of their ruling period within these camps.
[95]
After Aurangzeb, the Mughal capital definitively became the walled city of
Shahjahanabad
(Old Delhi).
[96]
Law
Police in Delhi under Bahadur Shah II, 1842
The Mughal Empire's legal system was context-specific and evolved over the course of the empire's rule. Being a Muslim state, the empire employed
fiqh
(Islamic jurisprudence) and therefore the fundamental institutions of Islamic law such as those of the
qadi
(judge),
mufti
(jurisconsult), and
muhtasib
(censor and market supervisor) were well-established in the Mughal Empire. However, the dispensation of justice also depended on other factors, such as administrative rules, local customs, and political convenience. This was due to Persianate influences on Mughal ideology, and the fact that the Mughal Empire governed a non-Muslim majority.
[97]
Legal ideology
The Mughal Empire followed the Sunni
Hanafi
system of jurisprudence. In its early years, the empire relied on Hanafi legal references inherited from its predecessor, the Delhi Sultanate. These included the
al-Hidayah
(the best guidance) and the
Fatawa al-Tatarkhaniyya
(religious decisions of the Emire Tatarkhan). During the Mughal Empire's peak, the
Fatawa 'Alamgiri
was commissioned by Emperor Aurangzeb. This compendium of Hanafi law sought to serve as a central reference for the Mughal state that dealt with the specifics of the South Asian context.
[98]
The Mughal Empire also drew on Persianate notions of kingship. Particularly, this meant that the Mughal emperor was considered the supreme authority on legal affairs.
[97]
Courts of law
Various kinds of courts existed in the Mughal empire. One such court was that of the
qadi
. The Mughal
qadi
was responsible for dispensing justice; this included settling disputes, judging people for crimes, and dealing with inheritances and orphans. The
qadi
also had additional importance with regards to documents, as the seal of the
qadi
was required to validate deeds and tax records.
Qadis
did not constitute a single position, but made up a hierarchy. For example, the most basic kind was the
pargana
(district)
qadi
. More prestigious positions were those of the
qadi al-quddat
(judge of judges) who accompanied the mobile imperial camp, and the
qadi-yi lashkar
(judge of the army).
[97]
Qadis
were usually appointed by the emperor or the
sadr-us-sudr
(chief of charities).
[97]
[99]
The jurisdiction of the
qadi
was availed by Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
[100]
The
jagirdar
(local tax collector) was another kind of official approached, especially for high-stakes cases. Subjects of the Mughal Empire also took their grievances to the courts of superior officials who held more authority and punitive power than the local
qadi
. Such officials included the
kotwal
(local police), the
faujdar
(an officer controlling multiple districts and troops of soldiers), and the most powerful, the
subahdar
(provincial governor). In some cases, the emperor themself dispensed justice directly.
[97]
Jahangir was known to have installed a "chain of justice" in the
Agra Fort
that any aggrieved subject could shake to get the attention of the emperor and bypass the inefficacy of officials.
[101]
Self-regulating tribunals operating at the community or village level were common, but sparse documentation of them exists. For example, it is unclear how
panchayats
(village councils) operated in the Mughal era.
[97]
Economy
Main article:
Economy of the Mughal Empire
The economy in the Indian Subcontinent during the Mughal era performed just as it did in ancient times, though now it would face the stress of extensive regional tensions.
[102]
The Mughal economy was large and prosperous.
[103]
[104]
India was producing 24.5% of the world's manufacturing output up until 1750.
[105]
[104]
India's economy has been described as a form of
proto-industrialization
, like that of 18th-century Western Europe prior to the
Industrial Revolution
.
[106]
The Mughals were responsible for building an extensive road system, creating a uniform currency, and the unification of the country.
[10]
: 185-204
The empire had an extensive road network, which was vital to the economic infrastructure, built by a
public works
department set up by the Mughals which designed, constructed and maintained roads linking towns and cities across the empire, making trade easier to conduct.
[103]
The main base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar.
[23]
[24]
These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator,
[25]
were paid in the well-regulated silver currency,
[22]
and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.
[26]
Coinage
Coin of Aurangzeb, minted in Kabul, dated 1691/2
The Mughals adopted and standardised the
rupee
(
rupiya
, or silver) and
dam
(copper) currencies introduced by
Sur
Emperor
Sher Shah Suri
during his brief rule.
[107]
The currency was initially 48 dams to a single rupee in the beginning of Akbar's reign, before it later became 38 dams to a rupee in the 1580s, with the dam's value rising further in the 17th century as a result of new industrial uses for copper, such as in bronze cannons and brass utensils. The dam was initially the most common coin in Akbar's time, before being replaced by the rupee as the most common coin in succeeding reigns.
[10]
The dam's value was later worth 30 to a rupee towards the end of Jahangir's reign, and then 16 to a rupee by the 1660s.
[108]
The Mughals minted coins with high purity, never dropping below 96%, and without
debasement
until the 1720s.
[109]
Despite India having its own stocks of gold and silver, the Mughals produced minimal gold of their own, but mostly minted coins from imported
bullion
, as a result of the empire's strong export-driven economy, with global demand for Indian agricultural and industrial products drawing a steady stream of
precious metals
into India.
[10]
Around 80% of Mughal India's imports were bullion, mostly silver,
[110]
with major sources of imported bullion including the
New World
and Japan,
[109]
which in turn imported large quantities of textiles and silk from the
Bengal Subah
province.
[10]
Labour
The historian Shireen Moosvi estimates that in terms of contributions to the Mughal economy, in the late 16th century, the primary sector contributed 52%, the secondary sector 18% and the tertiary sector 29%; the secondary sector contributed a higher percentage than in early 20th-century
British India
, where the secondary sector only contributed 11% to the economy.
[111]
In terms of urban-rural divide, 18% of Mughal India's labour force were urban and 82% were rural, contributing 52% and 48% to the economy, respectively.
[112]
According to Stephen Broadberry and Bishnupriya Gupta, grain wages in India were comparable to England in the 16th and 17th centuries, but diverged in the 18th century when they fell to 20-40% of England's wages.
[113]
[114]
This, however, is disputed by Parthasarathi and Sivramkrishna. Parthasarathi cites his estimates that grain wages for weaving and spinning in mid-18 century Bengal and South India was comparable to Britain.
[115]
Similarly, Sivramkrishna analyzed agricultural surveys conducted in Mysore by Francis Buchanan during 1800-1801, arrived at estimates using a "subsistence basket" that aggregated
millet
income could be almost five times subsistence level, while corresponding rice income was three times that much.
[116]
That could be comparable to advance part of Europe.
[117]
Due to the scarcity of data, however, more research is needed before drawing any conclusion.
[118]
[119]
According to Moosvi, Mughal India had a per-capita income, in terms of wheat, 1.24% higher in the late 16th century than British India did in the early 20th century.
[120]
This income, however, would have to be revised downwards if manufactured goods, like clothing, would be considered. Compared to food per-capita, expenditure on clothing was much smaller though, so relative income between 1595 and 1596 should be comparable to 1901-1910.
[121]
However, in a system where wealth was hoarded by elites, wages were depressed for
manual labour
.
[122]
In Mughal India, there was a generally tolerant attitude towards manual labourers, with some religious cults in northern India proudly asserting a high status for manual labour. While
slavery
also existed, it was limited largely to household servants.
[122]
Agriculture
Indian agricultural production increased under the Mughal Empire.
[103]
A variety of crops were grown, including food crops such as wheat, rice, and
barley
, and non-food
cash crops
such as cotton,
indigo
and
opium
. By the mid-17th century, Indian cultivators begun to extensively grow two new crops from the Americas, maize and tobacco.
[103]
The Mughal administration emphasised
agrarian reform
, which began under the non-Mughal emperor Sher Shah Suri, the work of which Akbar adopted and furthered with more reforms. The civil administration was organised in a hierarchical manner on the basis of merit, with promotions based on performance.
[123]
The Mughal government funded the building of
irrigation
systems across the empire, which produced much higher
crop yields
and increased the net revenue base, leading to increased agricultural production.
[103]
A major Mughal reform introduced by Akbar was a new land revenue system called
zabt
. He replaced the
tribute
system, previously common in India and used by
Tokugawa Japan
at the time, with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency.
[109]
The revenue system was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton, indigo,
sugar cane
, tree-crops, and opium, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.
[10]
Under the
zabt
system, the Mughals also conducted extensive
cadastral surveying
to assess the area of land under
plow
cultivation, with the Mughal state encouraging greater land cultivation by offering tax-free periods to those who brought new land under cultivation.
[109]
The expansion of agriculture and cultivation continued under later Mughal emperors including Aurangzeb, whose 1665
firman
edict stated: "the entire elevated attention and desires of the Emperor are devoted to the increase in the population and cultivation of the Empire and the welfare of the whole peasantry and the entire people."
[124]
Mughal agriculture was in some ways advanced compared to European agriculture at the time, exemplified by the common use of the
seed drill
among Indian peasants before its adoption in Europe.
[125]
While the average peasant across the world was only skilled in growing very few crops, the average Indian peasant was skilled in growing a wide variety of food and non-food crops, increasing their productivity.
[126]
Indian peasants were also quick to adapt to profitable new crops, such as maize and tobacco from the New World being rapidly adopted and widely cultivated across Mughal India between 1600 and 1650.
Bengali
farmers rapidly learned techniques of
mulberry
cultivation and
sericulture
, establishing
Bengal Subah
as a major silk-producing region of the world.
[10]
Sugar mills
appeared in India shortly before the Mughal era. Evidence for the use of a
draw bar
for sugar-milling appears at Delhi in 1540, but may also date back earlier, and was mainly used in the northern Indian subcontinent. Geared sugar
rolling mills
first appeared in Mughal India, using the principle of rollers as well as
worm gearing
, by the 17th century.
[127]
According to economic historian
Immanuel Wallerstein
, citing evidence from
Irfan Habib
,
Percival Spear
, and
Ashok Desai
, per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption in 17th-century
Mughal India
were probably higher than in 17th-century Europe and certainly higher than early 20th-century
British India
.
[128]
The increased agricultural productivity led to lower food prices. In turn, this benefited the Indian
textile industry
. Compared to Britain, the price of grain was about one-half in South India and one-third in Bengal, in terms of silver coinage. This resulted in lower silver coin prices for Indian textiles, giving them a price advantage in global markets.
[129]
Industrial manufacturing
Up until 1750, India produced about 25% of the world's industrial output.
[85]
Manufactured goods
and cash crops from the Mughal Empire were sold throughout the world. Key industries included textiles,
shipbuilding
, and steel. Processed products included cotton textiles,
yarns
,
thread
, silk,
jute
products,
metalware
, and foods such as sugar, oils and butter.
[103]
The growth of manufacturing industries in the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal era in the 17th-18th centuries has been referred to as a form of
proto-industrialization
, similar to 18th-century Western Europe prior to the
Industrial Revolution
.
[106]
In
early modern Europe
, there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers,
indigo
, silks, and
saltpeter
(for use in
munitions
).
[103]
European fashion
, for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of
British imports
from Asia, and the
Bengal Subah
province alone accounted for 40% of
Dutch imports
from Asia.
[130]
In contrast, there was very little demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient, thus Europeans had very little to offer, except for some
woolens
, unprocessed metals and a few luxury items. The trade imbalance caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to Mughal India in order to pay for South Asian imports.
[103]
Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan.
[10]
Textile industry

The largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was
textile manufacturing
, particularly cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of
piece goods
,
calicos
, and
muslins
, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton
textile industry
was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.
[103]
India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.
[131]
Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.
[132]
By the early 18th century, Mughal Indian textiles were clothing people across the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East.
[86]
The most important centre of cotton production was the Bengal province, particularly around its capital city of
Dhaka
.
[133]
Bengal accounted for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch from Asia,
[130]
Bengali silk and cotton textiles were exported in large quantities to Europe, Indonesia, and Japan,
[10]
: 202
and
Bengali muslin
textiles from Dhaka were sold in Central Asia, where they were known as "Dhaka textiles".
[133]
Indian textiles dominated the
Indian Ocean trade
for centuries, were sold in the Atlantic Ocean trade, and had a 38% share of the West African trade in the early 18th century, while Indian calicos were a major force in Europe, and Indian textiles accounted for 20% of total English trade with Southern Europe in the early 18th century.
[85]
The
worm gear
roller
cotton gin
, which was invented in India during the early
Delhi Sultanate
era of the 13th-14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire sometime around the 16th century,
[127]
and is still used in India through to the present day.
[134]
Another innovation, the incorporation of the
crank
handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India sometime during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.
[135]
The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the
spinning wheel
across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.
[136]
Once, the Mughal emperor Akbar asked his courtiers, which was the most beautiful flower. Some said rose, from whose petals were distilled the precious
ittar
, others, the lotus, glory of every Indian village. But Birbal said, "The cotton boll". There was a scornful laughter and Akbar asked for an explanation. Birbal said, "Your Majesty, from the cotton boll comes the fine fabric prized by merchants across the seas that has made your empire famous throughout the world. The perfume of your fame far exceeds the scent of roses and jasmine. That is why I say the cotton boll is the most beautiful flower.
[137]
Shipbuilding industry
Mughal India had a large
shipbuilding
industry, which was also largely centred in the Bengal province. Economic historian Indrajit Ray estimates shipbuilding output of Bengal during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at 223,250 tons annually, compared with 23,061 tons produced in nineteen colonies in North America from 1769 to 1771.
[138]
He also assesses ship repairing as very advanced in Bengal.
[138]
An important innovation in shipbuilding was the introduction of a
flushed deck
design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in
hulls
that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped
deck
design. The British
East India Company
later duplicated the flushed deck and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in
seaworthiness
and navigation for European ships during the
Industrial Revolution
.
[139]
Bengal Subah

The Bengal Subah province was especially prosperous from the time of its takeover by the Mughals in 1590 until the British East India Company seized control in 1757.
[140]
Historian
C. A. Bayly
wrote that it was probably the Mughal Empire's wealthiest province.
[141]
Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as rice, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks, and opium; Bengal accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, for example, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks.
[130]
From Bengal, saltpeter was also shipped to Europe, opium was sold in Indonesia, raw silk was exported to Japan and the Netherlands, and cotton and silk textiles were exported to Europe, Indonesia and Japan.
[10]
Akbar played a key role in establishing Bengal as a leading economic centre, as he began transforming many of the jungles there into farms. As soon as he conquered the region, he brought tools and men to clear jungles in order to expand cultivation and brought
Sufis
to open the jungles to farming.
[124]
Bengal was later described as the
Paradise of Nations
by Mughal emperors.
[142]
The Mughals introduced
agrarian reforms
, including the modern
Bengali calendar
.
[143]
The calendar played a vital role in developing and organising harvests, tax collection and Bengali culture in general, including the
New Year
and
Autumn
festivals.

The province was a leading producer of grains, salt, fruits, liquors and wines, precious metals and ornaments.
[144]
After 150 years of rule by Mughal
viceroys
, Bengal gained semi-independence as a
dominion
under the
Nawab of Bengal
in 1717. The Nawabs permitted European companies to set up trading posts across the region, including firms from
Britain
,
France
, the
Netherlands
,
Denmark
, Portugal and
Austria
. An
Armenian
community dominated banking and shipping in major cities and towns. The Europeans regarded Bengal as the richest place for trade.
[144]
By the late 18th century, the
British
displaced the Mughal ruling class in Bengal.

Urbanization
According to Irfan Habib Cities and towns boomed under the Mughal Empire, which had a relatively high degree of urbanization for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres.
[149]
This was higher than the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of
British India
in the 19th century;
[149]
the level of urbanization in Europe did not reach 15% until the 19th century.
[150]
Under Akbar's reign in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, 15% of the empire's total population. This was larger than the entire urban population in Europe at the time, and even a century later in 1700, the urban population of England, Scotland and Wales did not exceed 13% of its total population,
[147]
while British India had an urban population that was under 13% of its total population in 1800 and 9% in 1881, a decline from the earlier Mughal era.
[151]
By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.
[152]
Those estimates were criticised by
Tim Dyson
, who consider them exaggerations. According to Dyson urbanization of Mughal empire was less than 9%.
[153]
The historian
Nizamuddin Ahmad
(1551-1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, there were 120 large cities and 3200 townships.
[149]
A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,
[149]
with larger cities including
Agra
(in
Agra Subah
) with up to 800,000 people,
Lahore
(in
Lahore Subah
) with up to 700,000 people,
[154]
Dhaka
(in
Bengal Subah
) with over 1 million people,
[155]
[
]
and Delhi (in
Delhi Subah
) with over 600,000 people.
[156]
Cities acted as markets for the sale of goods, and provided homes for a variety of merchants, traders, shopkeepers, artisans, moneylenders, weavers, craftspeople, officials, and religious figures.
[103]
However, a number of cities were military and political centres, rather than manufacturing or commerce centres.

Art and literature
Main articles:
Mughal painting
and

Finial in the form of a parrot, Mughal empire, 17th century.
The
Mughal artistic tradition
, mainly expressed in painted miniatures, as well as small luxury objects, was eclectic, borrowing from Iranian, Indian, Chinese and Renaissance European stylistic and thematic elements.
[168]
Mughal emperors often took in Iranian bookbinders, illustrators, painters and calligraphers from the Safavid court due to the commonalities of their Timurid styles, and due to the Mughal affinity for Iranian art and calligraphy.
[169]
Miniatures commissioned by the Mughal emperors initially focused on large projects illustrating books with eventful historical scenes and court life, but later included more single images for albums, with portraits and animal paintings displaying a profound appreciation for the serenity and beauty of the natural world.
[170]
For example, Emperor Jahangir commissioned brilliant artists such as
Ustad Mansur
to realistically portray unusual flora and fauna throughout the empire.
The literary works Akbar and Jahangir ordered to be illustrated ranged from epics like the
Razmnama
(a Persian translation of the Hindu epic, the
Mahabharata
) to historical memoirs or biographies of the dynasty such as the
Baburnama
and
Akbarnama
, and
Tuzk-e-Jahangiri
. Richly-finished albums (
muraqqa
) decorated with calligraphy and artistic scenes were mounted onto pages with decorative borders and then bound with covers of stamped and gilded or painted and lacquered leather.
[171]
Aurangzeb (1658-1707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings.

Language

Hindustani language
According to Qazvini, by the time of
Shah Jahan
, the emperor was only familiar with a few
Turki
words and showed little interest in the study of the language as a child.
[173]
Though the Mughals were of
Turko-Mongol
origin, their reign enacted the revival and height of the
Persian language
in the Indian subcontinent. Accompanied by literary patronage was the institutionalisation of Persian as official and courtly language; this led to Persian reaching nearly the status of a first language for many inhabitants of Mughal India.
[174]
[175]
Muzaffar Alam
argues that the Mughals used Persian purposefully as the vehicle of an overarching
Indo-Persian
political culture, to unite their diverse empire.
[176]
Persian had a profound impact on the languages of South Asia; one such language, today known as
Urdu
, developed in the imperial capital of Delhi in the late Mughal era. It began to be used as a literary language in the Mughal court from the reign of
Shah Alam II
, who described it as the language of his
dastans
,
[177]
and replaced Persian as the language of the Muslim elite.
[178]
[179]
According to
Mir Taqi Mir
, "Urdu was the language of Hindustan by the authority of the King."

Ustad Ali Quli
, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formation—artillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the centre and the
mounted archers
on both wings. Babur used this formation at the
First Battle of Panipat
in 1526, where the
Afghan
and
Rajput
forces loyal to the
Delhi Sultanate
, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were defeated. The decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history.

The Indian war rockets ... were formidable weapons before such rockets were used in Europe. They had bam-boo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic. The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of Akbar and
Jahangir
.
Later, the
Mysorean rockets
were upgraded versions of Mughal rockets used during the
Siege of Jinji
by the progeny of the
Nawab of Arcot
.
Hyder Ali
's father
Fatah Muhammad
the constable at
Budikote
, commanded a corps consisting of 50 rocketmen (
Cushoon
) for the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali realised the importance of rockets and introduced advanced versions of metal cylinder rockets. These rockets turned fortunes in favour of the
Sultanate of Mysore
during the
Second Anglo-Mysore War
, particularly during the
Battle of Pollilur
. In turn, the Mysorean rockets were the basis for the
Congreve rockets
, which Britain deployed in the
Napoleonic Wars
against France and the
War of 1812
against the United States.

Science
Astronomy
See also:
Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world
and
Indian astronomy
While there appears to have been little concern for
theoretical astronomy
, Mughal
astronomers
made advances in
observational astronomy
and produced nearly a hundred
Zij
treatises.
Humayun
built a personal
observatory
near Delhi; Jahangir and Shah Jahan were also intending to build observatories, but were unable to do so. The
astronomical instruments
and observational techniques used at the Mughal observatories were mainly derived from
Islamic astronomy
.
[191]
[192]
In the 17th century, the Mughal Empire saw a synthesis between Islamic and
Hindu astronomy
, where Islamic observational instruments were combined with
Hindu computational
techniques.
[191]
[192]
During the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Hindu king
Jai Singh II of Amber
continued the work of Mughal
astronomy
. In the early 18th century, he built several large observatories called
Yantra Mandirs
, in order to rival
Ulugh Beg
's
Samarkand
observatory
, and in order to improve on the earlier Hindu computations in the
Siddhantas
and Islamic observations in
Zij-i-Sultani
. The instruments he used were influenced by Islamic astronomy, while the computational techniques were derived from Hindu astronomy.
[191]

Chemistry

Alchemy in the medieval Islamic world
Sake Dean Mahomed
had learned much of Mughal
chemistry
and understood the techniques used to produce various
alkali
and soaps to produce
shampoo
. He was also a notable writer who described the
Mughal Emperor
Shah Alam II
and the cities of
Allahabad
and Delhi in rich detail and also made note of the glories of the Mughal Empire.
In Britain, Sake Dean Mahomed was appointed as
shampooing surgeon
to both Kings
George IV
and
William IV
.

Metallurgy
See also:
History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent
One of the most remarkable astronomical instruments invented in Mughal India is the
lost-wax cast
, hollow, seamless,
celestial globe
. It was invented in
Kashmir
by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998
AH
(1589-90 CE), and twenty other such
globes
were later produced in
Lahore
and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern
metallurgists
to be technically impossible to produce hollow metal globes without any
seams
.
[194]
A 17th century celestial globe was also made by Diya’ ad-din Muhammad in
Lahore
, 1668 (now in Pakistan).
[195]
It is now housed at the
National Museum of Scotland

A cloth sash used for girding a kontusz (a robe-like garment).
Wacław Rzewuski
wearing a golden-finished kontusz sash
Kontusz scarf
Kontush sash
("kontusz belt";
Lithuanian
:
kontušo juosta
,
Belarusian
:
кунтушовы пояс
) was a cloth
sash
used for girding a
kontusz
(a robe-like garment). It was one of the most distinctive items of male dress of
Polish and Lithuanian
nobility (
szlachta
) from about 17th through the 19th centuries. In an earlier period, sometimes narrower sashes of fine cloth or silk net were worn, but the wide kontusz sash is specific to the later period. A variant known in Belarus lands is
Slutsk Sash
[
be
]
.
Origins
[
edit
]
Like the rest of Polish national dress, the kontusz sash was of eastern origin. It comprised a 3- to 4.5-meter-long strip of fabric covered with varied designs, around 40 cm wide. Luxurious sashes were made with
silk
and
gold
. Depending on the sash's width, it might be folded a number of ways so as to reveal various designs on various occasions, the most ornate sashes were considered to have four sides.
Initially such sashes were imported from
Persia
and
Turkey
. In the 17th century several sash
manufactories
were founded at places all over
Rzeczpospolita
, such as
Kobyłka
,
Lipków
,
Hrodna
,
Kraków
and
Gdańsk
. The largest and most notable  manufacturies, however, were at
Slutsk
. Sashes produced there were considered the most desirable and were also the most expensive. Because of the popularity of the
pas kontuszowy
produced there, it was sometimes called
pas słucki
(Slutsk sash), regardless of the actual place of origin. Slutsk sashes had two different color patterns on each side.

The Kontush Sash (belt) has an oriental provenance rooted in Persian and Turkish tradition.  Continual contact between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Persia and even more with Turkey developed vast trade roots  and raised popular interest in oriental art and decoration all over “Eastern” Europe.   The Ideology of Sarmathism created in the XVIc a wide super-ethnos embracing many Central European nations.  The Kontush Belt was a visual manifestation of Sarmathian identity and was widely popular in Lithuania and Belarus, in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Saxony, Moldavia, Besarabia and some parts of Russia.  Kontush belts were worn by the Nobility, Cossack elders and high municipal officials.
The time of prosperity during the period of XVI - XVIIIc created surplus financial resources often channeled into culture, art and decoration.  Polish Armenian merchants imported objects of luxury: oriental carpets,  weapons decorated with gold and stones, expensive fabrics.  Kontush belts especially emphasized the status of the bearer and were unusually expensive.  At a certain moment the demand for Kontush belts became so large that it was necessary to open local manufacturing on the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
The workshops producing Kontush Belts in Slutsk, Grodno, Lvov, Vilnius, Buchach, Kobylki, Kraków, Gdansk, Lipkow were opened mostly by Polish-Lithuanian Armenians.  The belts that were made there still had a lot of oriental ornamentation, but had their own distinct character - different from the belts formerly imported from Persia and Turkey.
There was a practical aspect to the belt as well.  Folded in half and wrapped around the body, it served as a pocket for money and documents.    
Most belts are about 30 cm wide and around 3,5m long.
As a result of the weaving technique - one side of the belt was a negative of the other.  This way it was possible for the belt to have two different color schemes (so called two-sided belt).  Further division of the belt allowed for four color compositions (four-sided belt).  The price of the belt depended on the materials used  (sometimes they added silver and gold thread).  The complexity of the design raised the price even more since it required more complicated manufacturing machinery, higher qualifications of the craftsmen and a longer production cycle.  The four-sided belts were the most expensive.  They were meant to be worn on different occasions:  bright side - for weddings, dark side for funerals, green side for the green kontush etc.  Very often the belt served as a table decoration - it was placed on the center atop the table cloth.
In popular culture
[
edit
]
A modern Polish poet and a singer,
Jacek Kaczmarski
, has sung about those sashes in one of his ballads,
Z pasa słuckiego pożytek
("The Use of a Slutsk Sash").

The Darlington F.C. team that won the 1887 Cleveland Challenge Cup. Players: (back row) G. Millar, W. Brooks, J. Davison, Tommy Waites, Michael Hope; (standing) Harry Hope; (seated on step) R.T. Stabler,
Arthur Wharton
, J.H. Smeddle, R.B. Buckton; (seated on ground) J.T. Hutchinson. Wearing suit: Charles Craven.
Darlington Football Club
, an English
association football
club based in
Darlington
,
County Durham
, was founded in 1883. They entered the
FA Cup
for the first time in
1885-86
,
[1]
were founder members of the
Northern League
in 1889,
[2]
turned professional in 1908 and joined the
North Eastern League
,
[1]
which they won in 1913 and 1921.
[2]
The latter win preceded election to
the Football League
as members of its newly formed
Third Division North
.
[1]
Runners-up in their first season, Darlington were Northern Section champions three years later, thus winning
promotion
to the
Second Division
. Their 15th-place finish in 1926 remains their best League performance, and they were relegated back to the Third Division the following year. After 68 years of continuous membership, they were relegated from the Football League in 1988-89. Having made an immediate return as
Conference
champions, they remained in the League until 2010, when they again dropped into the Conference.
[2]
After Darlington failed to exit
administration
in a manner acceptable to
the Football Association
, that body treated it as a new club, required it to change its name (to
Darlington 1883
), and placed its team in the Northern League, the ninth tier of English football, for the
2012-13 season
.
[3]
Five years later, the FA approved the club's request to resume its traditional name.
[4]
The club's
first team
have competed in numerous nationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in between 1 and 24 such matches, either as a member of the starting eleven or as a
substitute
, are listed below. Each player's details include the duration of his Darlington career, his typical
playing position
while with the club, and the number of games played and goals scored in domestic league matches and in all senior competitive matches. Where applicable, the list also includes the national team for which the player was selected, and the number of senior international
caps
he won.
Introduction
[
edit
]
More than 800 men played in nationally organised competition for Darlington but never reached the 25-appearance mark. In the early days, the scarcity of nationally organised competitive football meant players could spend many years with the club while making few such outings. Tommy Waites took part in the club's first FA Cup match in 1885 and made his 14th and last such appearance twelve years later. In between, he represented
Durham
in inter-county matches,
[5]
was appointed captain of Darlington F.C. in 1890,
[6]
and in 1896, was recognised as "one of the most respected and reliable members of the team".
[5]
Tom Rowlandson
, who kept goal in six FA Cup matches, was an
amateur international for England
, captained a touring
Corinthian
team that helped spread football worldwide and, as a captain in the
Yorkshire Regiment
, won the
Military Cross
before being killed in action during the
Somme Offensive
in 1916.
[7]
Eddie Carr
,
Len Walker
and
Simon Davey
went on to manage the club's first team.
[8]
Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club.
Bill Edmunds
and
John Ward
played in Darlington's first match in the Football League, a 2-0 win at home to
Halifax Town
on 27 August 1921.
[9]
Seven of the thirteen players used in the club's last match in the league, a 2-0 home defeat against
Dagenham & Redbridge
on 8 May 2010, fall into this category:
Nick Liversedge
,
Andrew Milne
,
Dan Burn
,
Gary Dempsey
,
Nathan Mulligan
,
Danny Groves
and the 16-year-old
Jordan Marshall
, who had made his senior debut just eleven days earlier.
[10]
Numerous players left Darlington to seek opportunities with other teams.
Reg Mountford
played for ten years in the
First Division
for
Huddersfield Town
, appeared in the
1938 FA Cup Final
, and managed the
Denmark national team
that won the bronze medal at the
1948 Olympics
.
[11]
Ray Wood
went on to win two
League titles
with Manchester United and play for
England
; he survived the
Munich air crash
, played another 300 times in the League and managed at both club and international level abroad.
[12]
The careers of others were winding down:
Aston Villa
's
European Cup
-winner
Allan Evans
's single appearance for Darlington was his last of an 18-year senior career.
[13]
Others were to make an impression in different sporting fields.
Graham Doggart
, who played twice for Darlington in 1921-22, became an administrator both in cricket, as a committee member of
Sussex CCC
and of the
MCC
, and in football, as chairman of
the Football Association
.
[14]
Walter Creasor
was a
speedway
rider in the early days of the sport in Britain.

Critical reception

Trouser Press
wrote that "with the almost orchestral sweep of this now-richly textured music,
A Dream in Sound
is a huge step beyond Elf Power’s relatively thin earlier albums, but Fridmann’s fingerprints are all over it, making the album considerably less distinctive and original."
[8]
The
Chicago Tribune
thought that "Andrew Rieger's sweetly plaintive voice gives the band's lilting melodies an air of hopeful melancholy, and if a few of the band's lyrical flights of fancy don't quite lift off, the songs on this disc rarely fail to charm."

. Created by writer-editor
Stan Lee
and artist
Steve Ditko
, he
first appeared
in the
anthology
comic book
Amazing Fantasy
#15 (August 1962) in the
Silver Age of Comic Books
. He has been featured in
comic books
,
television shows
,
films
,
video games
,
novels, and plays
.
Spider-Man's
secret identity
is
Peter Benjamin Parker
. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high school student and an orphan raised by his
Aunt May
and
Uncle Ben
in
New York City
after his parents
Richard and Mary Parker
died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many
supporting characters
, such as
Flash Thompson
,
J. Jonah Jameson
, and
Harry Osborn
;
romantic interests
Gwen Stacy
,
Mary Jane Watson
, and the
Black Cat
; and
enemies
such as the
Green Goblin
,
Doctor Octopus
, and
Venom
. In his
origin story
, Spider-Man gets his
superhuman
spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a
radioactive
spider; these include
superhuman strength
, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
spider-webs
of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by
a thief
that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.
When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of
sidekick
to the protagonist. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from
Queens
, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.
[8]
While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes
Bucky Barnes
and
Robin
, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like
Captain America
and
Batman
; he had learned the lesson for himself that "
with great power comes great responsibility
"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story, but later
retroactively attributed
to the late Uncle Ben Parker.
Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several
comic book series
, the first and longest-lasting of which is
The Amazing Spider-Man
. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the
Avengers
and
Fantastic Four
.
Doctor Octopus
also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012-2014, following
a body swap plot
in which Peter appears to die.
[9]
Marvel has also published comic books featuring
alternate versions of Spider-Man
, including
Spider-Man 2099
, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future;
Ultimate Spider-Man
, which features the adventures of a teenage
Peter Parker
in
the alternate universe
; and
Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man
, which depicts a teenager named
Miles Morales
who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the
Secret Wars
event, where he sometimes works alongside the mainline version of Peter.
Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.
[10]
He has appeared in countless
forms of media
, including
several animated TV series
: the first original animated series
Spider-Man
, with
Paul Soles
voicing the titular character, a
live-action television series
,
syndicated
newspaper
comic strips
, and multiple
series of films
. Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in
Spidey Super Stories
, a recurring skit on
The Electric Company
from 1974 to 1977.
[11]
In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors
Tobey Maguire

.
Publication history
Further information:
List of Spider-Man titles
Creation and development
Richard Wentworth,
a.k.a.
the
Spider
in the pulp magazine
The Spider
. Stan Lee stated the Spider influenced the creation of Spider-Man.
[14]
In 1962, with the success of the
Fantastic Four
, Marvel Comics editor and head writer
Stan Lee
was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.
[15]
: 1
As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.
[16]
In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman
pulp magazine
crime fighter the
Spider
as a great influence,
[14]
: 130
[17]
and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
[note 1]
Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years), and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a "sixth sense", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense".
[17]
Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.
[18]
He also decided to insert a
hyphen
in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume that starts with an "S" and ends with "man"
[19]
(although artist
Steve Ditko
intended the character to have an orange and purple costume).
[20]
At that time, Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher
Martin Goodman
for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.
[note 2]
Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series
Amazing Adult Fantasy
, which was renamed
Amazing Fantasy
for issue #15 (
cover-dated
August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).
[21]
In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that
Amazing Fantasy
would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.
[18]
While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spider-Man ... will appear every month in
Amazing
."
[21]
[22]
Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept and approached artist
Jack Kirby
. As
comics historian
Greg Theakston
recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with
Joe Simon
in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference," Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.
[23]
Steve Ditko would be the inker.
[note 3]
When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".
[23]
: 12
Lee turned to Ditko, who developed an art style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....
[24]
Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.
[21]
As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."
[25]
Amazing Fantasy
#15 (Aug. 1962) first introduced the character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of
The Amazing Spider-Man
comic book. - Cover art by penciller
Jack Kirby
and inker
Steve Ditko
In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in
Comic Fan
#2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal."
[26]
At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted
fetish
artist
Eric Stanton
, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own ... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."
[23]
: 14
Ditko claimed in a rare interview with
Jonathan Ross
that the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color scheme, rather than the recognizable red and blue.
[27]
Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and
Joe Simon
, who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the
Crestwood Publications
comic
Black Magic
, but the character was left unused.
[note 4]
Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed
Kirby's account, asserting that
Black Magic
was not a factor and that Simon devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's
Archie Comics
superhero, the
Fly
.
[28]
Artist
Steve Ditko
stated that Lee liked the name
Hawkman
from
DC Comics
, and that "Spider-Man" was an outgrowth of that interest.
[24]
Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character, but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "
Captain America
with cobwebs".
[note 5]
Writer
Mark Evanier
notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for
Amazing Fantasy
#15 and the first issue of
The Amazing Spider-Man
. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties, since Kirby was, said Evanier, "always busy".
[29]
: 127
Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly.
[29]
: 127
Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis." It was at this point that the entire concept of the strip went through a major overhaul. "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained." Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, where Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as "the first
work for hire
artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man".
[30]
Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one he saw in the five pencilled pages that Kirby had completed. To support this, Ditko used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel Thor, which was based on a name or idea of a character in Norse mythology: "If Marvel's Thor is a valid created work by Jack, his creation, then why isn't Spider-Man by Stan and me valid created work, our creation?"
[31]
Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who "got
Spider-Man
to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did".
[32]
Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, had acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]".
[33]
He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus easily identify with the character.
[18]
Commercial success
A few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.
[34]
: 97
A solo
ongoing series
followed, beginning with
The Amazing Spider-Man
#1 (
cover-dated
March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series
[8]
: 211
with the character swiftly becoming a
cultural icon
; a 1965
Esquire
poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the
Hulk
alongside
Bob Dylan
and
Che Guevara
as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was "beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us."

Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966),
John Romita Sr.
replaced him as
penciller
and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine
The Spectacular Spider-Man
, a proto-
graphic novel
designed to appeal to older readers. It lasted for two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series'
summer
Annual
s
that began in 1964.
[35]
An early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the
Comics Code Authority
. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of
illegal drugs
, even negatively. However, in 1970, the
Nixon
administration's
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.
[8]
: 239
Lee chose the top-selling
The Amazing Spider-Man;
issues #96-98
(May-July 1971) feature a
story arc
depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend
Harry Osborn
becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the
Green Goblin
(Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut, and the Code was subsequently revised.
[8]
: 239
In 1972, a second monthly
ongoing series
starring Spider-Man began:
Marvel Team-Up
, in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and supervillains.
[36]
From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. In 1976, his second solo series,
Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man
, began running parallel to the main series.
[37]
A third series featuring Spider-Man,
Web of Spider-Man
, launched in 1985 to replace
Marvel Team-Up
.
[38]
The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the "adjectiveless"
Spider-Man
(with the storyline "
Torment
"), written and drawn by popular artist
Todd McFarlane
, debuted with
several different covers
, all with the same interior content. All four versions combined sold over three million copies, an industry record at the time. Several
miniseries
,
one-shot
issues, and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent
cameos
and
guest appearances
in other comic book series.
[37]
[39]
In 1996,
The Sensational Spider-Man
was created to replace
Web of Spider-Man
.
[40]
In 1998, writer-artist
John Byrne
revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series
Spider-Man: Chapter One
(Dec. 1998-Oct. 1999), similar to Byrne's adding details and some revisions to Superman's origin in
DC Comics
'
The Man of Steel
.
[41]
During that time, the original
The Amazing Spider-Man
ended with issue #441 (Nov. 1998), and
The Amazing Spider-Man
started with volume 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).
[42]
In 2003, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for
The Amazing Spider-Man
and what would have been volume 2, #59, became issue #500 (Dec. 2003).
[42]
When the main series
The Amazing Spider-Man
reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing
The Amazing Spider-Man
three times monthly, beginning with #546-548 (all January 2008).
[43]
The scheduling of
The Amazing Spider-Man
lasted until November 2010, when the comic book expanded from 22 pages to 30 pages for each issue. Later on,
The Amazing Spider-Man
was published twice a month, beginning with #648-649 (both November 2010).
[44]
[45]
The following year, Marvel launched
Avenging Spider-Man
as the first spin-off ongoing series in addition to
The Amazing Spider-Man
, since the previous ones were canceled at the end of 2007.
[43]
The
Amazing
series temporarily ended with
issue #700
in December 2012 and was replaced by
The Superior Spider-Man
, which had
Doctor Octopus
serve as the new Spider-Man by taking over Peter Parker's body.
Superior
was an enormous commercial success for Marvel,
[46]
and ran for 31 issues before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched
The Amazing Spider-Man
#1 in April 2014.
[47]
Following the 2015
Secret Wars
crossover event
, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the "
All-New, All-Different Marvel
" event. Among them,
The Amazing Spider-Man
was relaunched and primarily focuses on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becomes a successful businessman who is operating worldwide.
[48]
Fictional character biography
Early years
In
Forest Hills
,
Queens
, New York City,
[49]
Midtown High School
student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his
Uncle Ben
and
Aunt May
. As depicted in
Amazing Fantasy
#15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a
radioactive
spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an
arachnid
".
[50]
Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star. However, "[h]e blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing
thief
, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben." Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, "With great power there must also come—great responsibility!"
[51]
In the first issue of
The Amazing Spider-Man
(March 1963), despite his superpowers, Peter struggles to help his widowed Aunt May pay the rent, is taunted by Flash, and continues fighting crime and saving the city as Spider-Man, but his heroic deeds engender the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher of the
Daily Bugle
,
J. Jonah Jameson
, holds a grudge against Spider-Man, and continues making false statements about Spider-Man despite his heroism. Peter gets hired as a
freelance
photographer by Mr. Jameson to take pictures of Spider-Man, with him being unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker.
[52]
[53]
Spider-Man fights his
enemies
, including superpowered and non-superpowered
supervillains
—his
arch-enemy and nemesis
Green Goblin
, and then
Doctor Octopus
,
Sandman
,
Chameleon
,
Lizard
,
Vulture
,
Kraven the Hunter
,
Electro
, and
Mysterio
, defeating them one by one
[54]
—but Peter finds juggling his personal and superhero life difficult. In time, Peter graduates from high school
[55]
and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life
Columbia University
and
New York University
),
[56]
where he meets roommate and best friend
Harry Osborn
and girlfriend
Gwen Stacy
,
[57]
and Aunt May introduces him to
Mary Jane Watson
.
[54]
[58]
[59]
As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father,
Norman Osborn
, is revealed to be the Green Goblin, Peter attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while.
[60]
[61]
Gwen Stacy's father,
New York City Police
detective Captain
George Stacy
, is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (issue #90, November 1970).
[62]
1970s
In
issue #121
(June 1973),
[54]
the Green Goblin throws
Gwen Stacy
from a tower of either the
Brooklyn Bridge
(as depicted in the art) or the
George Washington Bridge
(as given in the text).
[63]
[64]
She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt, and Spider-Man swears revenge against his nemesis; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: "It saddens us to say that the
whiplash effect
she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her."
[65]
The following issue, Spider-Man vengefully attacks and overpowers the Green Goblin, who kills himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.
[66]
Working through his grief, Peter eventually develops tentative feelings toward Mary Jane, and the two "become confidants rather than lovers".
[67]
A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in issue #182 (July 1978), and being turned down an issue later.
[68]
Peter went on to graduate from college in issue #185,
[54]
and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy,
a.k.a.
the
Black Cat
,
[69]
whom he meets in issue #194 (July 1979).
[54]
1980s
The Amazing Spider-Man
#252 (May 1984): The black costume debut was controversial among fans. The suit was later revealed as an alien
symbiote
and was used in the creation of the villain
Venom
. - Cover art by
Ron Frenz
and
Klaus Janson
From 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest. The new costume originated in the
Secret Wars
miniseries
on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth's major superheroes and supervillains.
[70]
He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in
The Amazing Spider-Man
#252. The change to a longstanding character's design met with controversy, "with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege. Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C. rivals
Superman
and
Batman
."
[71]
The creators then revealed the costume was an alien
symbiote
, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle,
[72]
though the symbiote returns several times as
Venom
for revenge.
[54]
Peter proposes to Mary Jane in
The Amazing Spider-Man
#290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with
the wedding
taking place in
The Amazing Spider-Man Annual
#21 (1987)—promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at
Shea Stadium
, with Stan Lee officiating, on June 5, 1987.
[73]
David Michelinie
, who scripted based on a plot by editor-in-chief
Jim Shooter
, said in 2007, "I didn't think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had actually planned another version, one that wasn't used."
[73]
Peter publishes a book of Spider-Man photographs called
Webs
,
[74]
and returns to his Empire State University
graduate studies
in
biochemistry
in #310 (Dec. 1988).
[54]
1990s
In the controversial
[75]
1990s storyline the "
Clone Saga
", a clone of Parker, created in 1970s comics by insane scientist
Miles Warren
, a.k.a. the Jackal, returns to New York City upon hearing of
Aunt May
's health worsening. The clone had lived incognito as
Ben Reilly
, but now assumes the superhero guise the
Scarlet Spider
and allies with Parker. To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone.
[76]
Complicating matters, Mary Jane announces in
The Spectacular Spider-Man
#220 (Jan. 1995) that she is pregnant with Peter's baby.
[54]
Later, however, a resurrected
Green Goblin
(Norman Osborn) has Mary Jane poisoned, causing
premature labor
and the death of her and Peter's unborn daughter.
[77]
It is later revealed that The Green Goblin switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Peter's life by making him believe himself to be the clone. Ben is killed while saving Peter, in
Peter Parker: Spider-Man
#75 (Dec. 1996), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Ben was the clone.
[77]
In issue #97 (Nov. 1998) of the second series titled
Peter Parker: Spider-Man
,
[78]
Parker learns his Norman Osborn kidnapped Aunt May and her apparent death in
The Amazing Spider-Man
#400 (April 1995) had been a hoax.
[79]
[80]
Shortly afterward, in
The Amazing Spider-Man
(vol. 2) #13 (#454, Jan. 2000), Mary Jane is killed in an airplane explosion.
[81]
She is revealed to be alive in volume 2, issue #28 (#469, April 2001),
[81]
but she and Peter are completely separated in the following issue.
[82]
2000s
Babylon 5
creator
J. Michael Straczynski
began writing
The Amazing Spider-Man
, illustrated by
John Romita Jr.
, beginning with volume 2, #30 (#471, June 2001). Two issues later, Peter, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets the enigmatic
Ezekiel
, who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Peter, having gained such abilities, might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a
totemic
spider spirit. In vol. 2, #37 (#478, Jan. 2002), Aunt May discovers her nephew is Spider-Man.
[80]
Peter and Mary Jane reconcile in (vol. 2) #50 (#491, April 2003),
[80]
and in #512 (Nov. 2004)—the original issue numbering having returned with #500—Parker learns his late girlfriend
Gwen Stacy
had had two children with
Norman Osborn
.
[83]
He joins the superhero team
The New Avengers
in
New Avengers
#1-2. After a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate destroys their respective homes, Peter, Mary Jane, and May move into
Stark Tower
, and Peter begins working as
Tony Stark
's assistant while freelancing for
The
Daily Bugle
and continuing his teacher career. In the 12-part 2005 story arc "
The Other
", Peter undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers. In the comic
Civil War
#2 (June 2006), part of the company-wide
crossover
arc of that title, the U.S. government's
Superhuman Registration Act
leads Spider-Man to reveal his true identity publicly. A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and Mary Jane and joins the anti-registration underground.
In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), Aunt May is critically wounded from
Wilson Fisk
's sniper, and enters into a coma. Peter, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a
pact with the demon-lord
Mephisto
, who saves May's life in exchange for Peter and Mary Jane agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man's identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Mary Jane returns and is cold toward him. The controversial
[84]
storyline "One More Day" rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor-in-chief
Joe Quesada
, who said, "Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man".
[84]
It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski, who "told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc", but was talked out of doing so.
[85]
At issue with Straczynski's climax to the arc, Quesada said, was
...that we didn't receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting. What made that very problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on [the sequel arc] "Brand New Day" that were expecting and needed "One More Day" to end in the way that we had all agreed it would. ... The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series. Also, the science that Joe was going to apply to the
retcon
of the marriage would have made over 30 years of Spider-Man books worthless, because they never would have had happened. ...[I]t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider-Man titles. We just couldn't go there....
[85]
In this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the
Marvel Universe
, Parker returns to work at the
Daily Bugle
, which has been renamed
The DB
under a new publisher.
[86]
He soon switches to the
alternative press
paper

During the "
Secret Invasion
" by shape-shifting extra-terrestrials, the
Skrulls
, Norman Osborn shoots and kills the Skrull queen
Veranke
.
[89]
He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the new director of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force
H.A.M.M.E.R.
to advance his agenda,
[89]
while using his public image to start his own
Dark Avengers
. Norman, by himself, leads the Dark Avengers as the Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself after
Iron Man's armor
with Captain America's colors.
[90]
Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. It is later revealed that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking the American Son armor, whom Norman had planned to kill, in order to increase public sympathy. When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man says to decapitate him, since Norman's healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to "become the son Norman always wanted". Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.

2010s
At
Loki

[93]
A conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus over Osborn's son ends when it is revealed the child's father is Harry, who leaves town to raise him.
[94]
One of Doctor Octopus' Octobots swaps his and Spider Man's personality, causing Peter to become trapped in the Doctor's dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter's life for himself. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he manages to establish a weak link with the Doctor's mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories; Otto understands Peter's ideals of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a "Superior" Spider-Man.
[95]
[96]
A portion of Peter survived in his original body in the form of a subconsciousness.
[97]
Later, realizing that he failed in his role as the "Superior" Spider-Man, Otto willingly allows Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn and save Anna Maria Marconi, Otto's love.
[98]
In the aftermath of these events, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto's arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs.
[99]
Peter soon learns a second person had been bitten by the radioactive spider,
Cindy Moon
.
[100]
Spider-Man tracks her down and frees her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms.
[101]
Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own heroine identity as Silk,
[102]
[103]
Spider-Man encounters a contingent of spider-people from all over the
Multiverse
that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires who had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities.
[104]
During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by an alternate version of Otto Octavius.
[105]
Together, they neutralize the Inheritors.
Peter then stops a nefarious plan put forward by the Jackal.
[106]
After the events of "
Go Down Swinging
", Peter's life was plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, Mayor Fisk publicly supports him, condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials were revoked after accusations of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius, resulting in Peter being fired from the
Daily Bugle
. Subsequently, Peter became romantically involved with Mary Jane.
[107]
Briefly, Peter Parker and Spider-Man split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. Peter eventually manages to reverse the process, and merges his two halves back together before the side-effects worsen and result in their death.

[109]
Personality and themes
"People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What Lee and Ditko actually did in
The Amazing Spider-Man
was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character's life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this month's bad guys... Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience."
Comics historian
Peter Sanderson
[110]
Sally Kempton for the
Village Voice
opined in 1965 that "Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked
inferiority complex
, and a fear of women. He is
antisocial
,
castration-ridden
, racked with
Oedipal guilt
, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning
neurotic
".
[49]
Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.
[111]
Cultural historian Bradford W. Wright notes:
Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of
The Amazing Spider-Man
, J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the
Daily Bugle
, launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace". The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's
Daily Bugle
.
[8]
: 212
The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time; early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the
Cold War
and
communism
.
[8]
: 220-223
Wright writes:
From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant
student demonstrations
at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.

Powers, skills, and equipment
Peter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider.
[112]
Since the original
Lee
-
Ditko
stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls. This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the
van der Waals force
,
[113]
though in the
2002
Spider-Man
film
, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging
cilia
in the manner of a real spider's feet. Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength, agility and balance, and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his "Spider-Sense," which alerts him to danger.
[112]
Spider-Man has a
healing factor
that allows him to recover from injuries sustained during battle.
[114]
In the aftermath of the 1989 "
Acts of Vengeance
" storyline, Spider-Man was said to have "superhuman recuperative abilities" that sped up his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the Tri-Sentinel.
[115]
The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, and later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level.
[116]
After years of fighting, Peter honed his skill into an equivalent of martial arts that is unique to his powers. Academically brilliant, Peter has expertise in the fields of
applied science
,
chemistry
,
physics
,
biology
,
engineering
,
mathematics
, and
mechanics
.
With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters that allow him to shoot webs, swing at high speeds throughout the city, and navigate and trap his enemies with his webs, additionally with a spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals.

J. Jonah Jameson
is the publisher of the
Daily Bugle
and Peter Parker's boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he constantly features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's editor and confidant,
Robbie Robertson
is always depicted as a supporter of both Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker.
[52]
Eugene "Flash" Thompson
is commonly depicted as Peter Parker's high school tormentor and bully, who idolizes Spider-Man, but is unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Later, he becomes a friend of Peter and adopts his own superhero identity, Agent Venom, after merging with the
Venom
symbiote
.

Meanwhile,
Harry Osborn
, son of Norman Osborn, is most commonly recognized as Peter's best friend, although some versions depicted him as his rival.

Unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man does not have a single villain with whom he has come into conflict the most. Instead, he is often regarded as having three archenemies:
[165]
Doctor Octopus (a.k.a. Doc Ock) is a highly intelligent
mad scientist
who uses four mechanical appendages for both movement and combat. He has been described as Spider-Man's greatest enemy, and the man Peter Parker might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility.
[15]
[166]
Doc Ock is infamous for defeating him the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter's
Aunt May
. He is also the core leader of the
Sinister Six
, and at one point adopted the "Master Planner" alias. ("
If This Be My Destiny...!
")
[167]
Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker's body, where
he was the titular character for a while
.
[166]
The Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin is most commonly regarded as Spider-Man's
arch-enemy
.
[165]
[168]
[169]
While Norman is usually portrayed as an amoral
industrialist
and the head of the
Oscorp
scientific corporation, the Goblin is a psychopathic alternate personality, born after Norman's exposore to some unstable chemicals that also increased his strength and agility. The Goblin is a
Halloween
-themed villain, dressing up like an actual
goblin
and utilizing a large arsenal of high tech weapons, including a glider and pumpkin-shaped explosives. Unlike most villains, who only aim to kill Spider-Man, the Goblin also targets his loved ones and shows no remorse in killing them as long as it caused pain to Spider-Man. His most infamous feat is killing
Spider-Man's girlfriend
, in what became
one of the most famous Spider-Man stories
of all time and helped to end the
Silver Age of Comic Books
and begin the
Bronze Age of Comic Books
.
[165]
While the Goblin was killed in the same story, he returned in the 1990s to plague Spider-Man once again, committing more heinous acts (such as being involved in the murder of Aunt May). He also came into conflict with
other heroes
, such as the
Avengers
.
[170]
Norman is sometimes depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man, even when not being the Green Goblin.
[171]
The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is often regarded as Spider-Man's deadliest foe, and has been described as an evil mirror version of Spider-Man in many ways.
[157]
[119]
[165]
He is also among Spider-Man's most popular villains.
[172]
Originally a reporter who grew to despise Spider-Man, Eddie later came into contact with the Venom symbiote, which had been rejected by Spider-Man. The symbiote merged with Eddie and gave him the same powers as Spider-Man, in addition to making him immune to the web-slinger's "spider-sense". Venom's main goal is to ruin Peter Parker's life and mentally confuse him in any way he can.
[160]
The character has a sense of honor and justice, and later starred in his own
comic book stories
, where he is depicted as an
antihero
and has a desire to protect innocent people from harm. On several occasions, he and Spider-Man even put their differences aside and became allies.
[157]
[173]
Romantic interests
Peter Parker's romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student
Liz Allan
,
[52]
to having his first date with
Betty Brant
,
[174]
secretary to the
Daily Bugle
newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. After his breakup with Betty Brant, Peter eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend
Gwen Stacy
,
[54]
[57]
daughter of
New York City Police Department
detective Captain
George Stacy
, both of whom are later killed by
supervillain
enemies of Spider-Man.
[62]
Mary Jane Watson
became Peter's best friend and eventually his wife.
[73]
Felicia Hardy, the
Black Cat
, is a reformed
cat burglar
who had been Spider-Man's sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point.
[69]
Children
Over the course of the comics, Peter Parker had several biological children across different continuities, usually with Mary Jane Watson, including
Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)
and
Benjy Parker
from the MC2 universe, and
Spiderling (Annie Parker)
from Earth-18119.
[175]
[176]
Alternate versions of Spider-Man
Main article:
Alternative versions of Spider-Man
Within the
Marvel Universe
, there exists a
multiverse
with many variations of Spider-Man.
[177]
An early character included in the 1980s is the fictional
anthropomorphic animal
parody
of Spider-Man as a pig named
Spider-Ham
(Peter Porker).
[178]
Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the futuristic version of Spider-Man in
Marvel 2099
named
Miguel O'Hara
. In the
Marvel Comics 2
imprint, Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named
Mayday Parker
, who carries on Spider-Man's legacy, while
Marvel Noir
has a 1930s version
of Peter Parker
.
[177]
[179]
[180]
Other themed versions exist within the early 2000s, such as a
Marvel Mangaverse
version and an Indian version from
Spider-Man: India
,
Pavitr Prabhakar
.
[177]
[181]
Ultimate Spider-Man
was a popular modern retelling of Spider-Man,
Peter Parker
. The version of Peter Parker would later be depicted as being killed off and replaced by a
Black Hispanic
Spider-Man named
Miles Morales
.
[182]
The storyline "
Spider-Verse
" brought back many alternate takes on Spider-Man and introduced many new ones, such as an alternate world where
Gwen Stacy
gets bitten by a radioactive spider instead, along with a British-themed version named
Spider-UK
, who is Billy Braddock from the
Captain Britain Corps
.
[179]
[183]
Cultural impact and legacy
In
The Creation of Spider-Man
, comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers "nothing too original"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a "nerdy high school student".
[184]
: 5
Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included "heavy doses of
soap-opera
and elements of melodrama". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: "the flawed superhero with everyday problems". This idea spawned a comics revolution.
[184]
: 6
The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books, such as
The Amazing Spider-Man
,
The Incredible
Hulk
,
The
Fantastic Four
, and
The
X-Men
ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them.
[185]
After the comics depicted a real address in
Forest Hills, Queens
, New York, as May Parker's residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero.
[186]
Spider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products.
[187]
He has been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the
New York Stock Exchange
in 1991,
The Wall Street Journal
announced "Spider-Man is coming to
Wall Street
"; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange.
[8]
: 254
Since 1962, hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world.
[188]
Spider-Man is the world's most profitable superhero.
[189]
[

]
In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion.
[190]
Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of
Batman
,
Superman
, and the
Avengers
combined.
[189]
U.S. President
Barack Obama
pretending to be webbed up by a boy dressed in a Spider-Man costume inside the
White House
Spider-Man joined the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats,
[191]
designed by
John Romita Sr.
,
[192]
one of the character's signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared from 2009 to 2014.
[191]
When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the
September 11 attacks
, the company chose the December 2001 issue of
The Amazing Spider-Man
.
[193]
In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character's secret identity,
[194]
an event detailed in a full-page story in the
New York Post
before the issue containing the story was even released.
[195]
In 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the
United Nations
, depicting Spider-Man alongside the
UN Peacekeeping Forces
to highlight UN peacekeeping missions.
[196]
A
BusinessWeek
article listed Spider-Man as one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.
[197]
In 2015, the
Supreme Court of the United States
decided
Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC
, a case concerning royalties on a
patent
for an imitation web shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice
Elena Kagan
, included several Spider-Man references, concluding with the statement that "with great power, there must also come—great responsibility".
[198]
Spider-Man has become a subject of scientific inquiry. In 1987,
researchers
at
Loyola University
conducted a study into the utility of Spider-Man comics for informing children and parents about issues relating to
child abuse
.
[199]
Reception
The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of
Thor
. He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he's more relatable than playboy billionaire
Iron Man
. And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like
Captain America
. Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.
—IGN staff on placing Spider-Man as the number one hero of Marvel.
[200]
In 2005,
Bravo
's

[205]
A 2015 poll at
Comic Book Resources
named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time.
[206]
IGN described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noted his uniqueness compared to many superheroes with his depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN wrote that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time, he is "one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence."
[200]
Empire
praised Spider-Man's always-present sense of humor and wisecracks in the face of the many tragedies he faces. The magazine website appraised the depiction of his "iconic" superhero poses, describing it as "a top artist's dream".
[203]
George Marston of
Newsarama
called Spider-Man's origin the greatest origin story of all time, opining that "Spider-Man's origin combines all of the most classic aspects of pathos, tragedy and scientific wonder into the perfect blend for a superhero origin."
[207]
Real-life comparisons

Plot
[
edit
]
Gaetano is a shy Neapolitan boy who lives in a southern-Italian city with his family: one brother, one sister, his mother and his father, an extremely Catholic man who has lost his right hand, and confides in a miracle by Madonna of the swords to get it back.
Tired and bored about the excessive provincialism of his "entourage", and his alienating job in a food factory, Gaetano decides to hitch-hike to the more modern and cosmopolitan city of Florence. There he meets a beautiful girl, Marta, and they fall in love. Gaetano sets at Marta's and is later joined by his old friend Lello, a clumsy and rotund boy, albeit very funny in his friendship with the protagonist.
One night at Marta's, while reading a manuscript, Marta reveals to be pregnant, and she's not sure that Gaetano is the child's father: Marta had a relationship with a teenager boy, and she sincerely tells the whole story to Gaetano, that gets sad and embittered, and goes back to Naples, officially for his sister's wedding, actually to clear his mind about the facts. There he discovers himself very in love with Marta and rejoins her back in Florence, accepting her child even if he's not sure of being the natural father.

. The
watershed
in
Begovac
is popularly known as

. There is a natural
Pečenačko lake
in the field, and an artificial lake in
Borovača
. Grahovsko polje is influenced by the
Mediterranean
and
continental climate
, with long and strong winters and short and warm summers. Due to its location, this area has a very large number of sunny days a year.
[1]
[3]
In the area of Grahovski Polje there is a significant deposit of
clay
for the production of
bricks
and
tiles
, which has been exploited for more than 50 years and is not in production today.
Along with the abundance of karst formations, in the
limestone
massif of
Stražbenica
in the area of the village of
Resanovci
, there is one of the largest
speleological
systems in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is the

The field is mostly suitable for
cattle breeding
.
The Glamočko Polje was inhabited since the time of the
Neanderthals
. The
Illyrians
from the
Dicioni
[
bs
]
tribe lived there. The
Romans
built several settlements and roads.

The video features a scene of a bus conductor calling out to passengers to board his vehicle to
Ojuelegba
; Wizkid is seen boarding the bus.
B-roll
scenes of Ayilara and Itire roads were also included in the cut. The video depicts the dramatic and realistic perspective of community life in Ojuelegba.

[1]
Bukola Adegunle of

Montreal Stock Exchange (1874-1982)
[
edit
]
The first exchange in Canada began in 1832 as an informal
stock exchange
at the
Exchange Coffee House
in Montreal. In 1874, Lorn MacDougall, along with his brothers Hartland St. Clair MacDougall and George Campbell MacDougall, James Burnett and Frank Bond were the driving force behind the creation of the
Montreal Stock Exchange
(a name that was used until 1982 when it became the Montreal Exchange). The shareholders voted Lorn MacDougall its first Chairman of the Governing Committee, a position he held until poor health forced him to retire in 1883.
By 1910, the number of trades amounted to about $2.1 million whereas the Toronto Stock Exchange only amounted to $900,000. The prosperity of the Montreal Stock Exchange led to the creation of major corporations like
Dominion Textile
and
Montreal Light, Heat & Power
.
At that time, many major financial institutions established their headquarters on and around
Saint Jacques Street
. In 1903, the same year as the construction of New York's now famous Exchange Building, the
Montreal Stock Exchange
commissioned the same architect,
George B. Post
, to design its building on St. Francois-Xavier Street.
World War I
marked the end of Canada's dependence on
London
's market. By contributing greatly to the war effort, Canada's economy was greatly strengthened by the war. All through the 1920s, Montreal's market experienced strong growth, reaching $3.5 million.

In 1926, the "
Montreal Curb Market
" was created to allow trading in speculative and junior stocks. If successfully grown, they could apply for a transfer to the main Exchange. In 1953, the Curb Market was renamed the
Canadian Stock Exchange
.
The 1929 crisis hit Montreal especially hard. In 1934, due to multiple factors, the Toronto Stock Exchange surpassed Montreal. Still, Montreal's position in Canada's  economy recovered, and it was not until the mid-1970s that Toronto became the metropolis of Canada after a decade of political troubles in Montreal.

For the
separatist
group
Front de libération du Québec
, the Montreal Stock Exchange represented a bastion of Anglo-Canadian power. On February 13, 1969, they
detonated a bomb
at the Stock Exchange that blew out the northeast wall and injured 27 people.
Montreal Exchange (1982-present)
[
edit
]
In 1982, the Montreal Stock Exchange changed its name to the Montreal Exchange to reflect the growing importance of financial instruments other than stocks-primarily options and futures-on its trading floor.
Former Montreal Exchange logo
In 1999, the Vancouver, Alberta, Toronto and Montreal exchanges agreed to restructure the Canadian capital markets along the lines of market specialization, resulting in the Montreal Exchange assuming the position of Canadian Derivatives Exchange for the following 10 years. Trading in the shares of large companies was transferred to the
Toronto Stock Exchange
(TSX), and in the trading of smaller companies to the new
Canadian Venture Exchange
(now:
TSX Venture Exchange
). This change, which reflected the economic reality that most equity trading had moved to the TSE, caused consternation among those in favour of political independence for the province of Quebec.
At the end of 2001, the Exchange had completed its migration from an
open outcry
environment to a fully automated trading system, becoming the first traditional exchange in North America to complete this transformation. In the process, it modified the market model for trading, from a traditional specialist model to a competing market making model for the equity option market.
In February 2004, the Exchange became the sole provider of electronic trading systems and support for the
Boston Options Exchange
(BOX), making it the first foreign exchange to be responsible for the day-to-day technical operations of an American exchange using the
Sola Trading
electronic platform.
[2]
That contract now provides the Montreal Exchange with a significant part of its revenue. The Montreal Exchange has a 31.4% stake in the Boston Option Exchange (BOX), percentage that has since risen to over 51% (as of September 2009).
On December 10, 2007, TSX Group announced that it had acquired Montreal Exchange Inc. for C$1.31 Billion.
[3]
[4]
The acquisition was completed on 1 May 2008 and the corporation subsequently was renamed
TMX Group Inc
.
[5]
On February 9, 2011, the
London Stock Exchange
announced that they had agreed to merge with the
TMX Group
, Montreal Exchange's parent, hoping to create a combined entity with a market capitalization of
$5.9 trillion
(£3.7 trillion).
Xavier Rolet
, who currently is CEO of the
LSE Group
, would head the new enlarged company, while TMX Chief Executive Thomas Kloet would become the new firm president.  Based on data from
December 30, 2010
the new stock exchange would be the second largest in the world with a market cap 48% greater than  the
Nasdaq
. Eight of the fifteen board members of the combined entity will be nominated by LSE and seven by TMX.
[6]
[7]
The provisional name for the combined group would be
LTMX Group
plc.
[8]
On June 13, 2011, a rival, and hostile bid from the
Maple Group
of Canadian interests, was unveiled. A cash and stock bid of $3.7 billion CAD, in hopes of blocking the LSE Group's takeover of TMX. The group is composed of the leading banks and financial institutions of Canada.

The
Montreal Curb Market
was a
stock exchange
created in 1926 for trading in stocks that were considered to be too speculative or junior to be traded on the Montreal Stock Exchange (MSE). As these companies matured, trading in their shares was transferred to the MSE.
In 1953, the Montreal Curb Market changed its name to Canadian Stock Exchange. In 1974, the Canadian Stock Exchange merged with the Montreal Stock Exchange, retaining the larger exchange's name.
On November 29, 1999, the small-cap portion of the equities market of the Montreal Exchange was merged into the
Canadian Venture Exchange
(CDNX), along with the
Alberta Stock Exchange
(ASE) and the
Vancouver Stock Exchange
(VSE). The
Canadian Dealing Network
and
Winnipeg Stock Exchange
also merged with CDNX. The Canadian Venture Exchange is today known as the TSX Venture Exchange and is based in
Calgary
, although still has offices in Montreal.
Montreal Climate Exchange
[
edit
]
The
Montreal Climate Exchange
or
MCeX
was started as a joint venture between the Montreal Exchange and the now-defunct
Chicago Climate Exchange
(CCX). It trades futures contracts on
greenhouse gases
. Established on July 12, 2006, and launched on May 30, 2008, MCeX is the first regulated environmental market in Canada.
Background
[
edit
]
As part of the 2008 federal climate plan,
[10]
in addition to internal reductions, large regulated industrial emitters in Canada are able to choose to buy emission units on the domestic carbon market.  Regulated emitters’ credits are issued by government authorities at the end of a compliance year to regulated emitters that reduce the intensity of their
GHG emissions
below the target established by the federal government. These emitters are able to sell their credits on the market or keep them for subsequent compliance years.   Futures contracts sold on the MCeX are equal to 100 Canada carbon dioxide equivalent units (one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent).
Timeline
[
edit
]
On July 12, 2006, the Montréal Climate Exchange was established as a partnership between the MX and the CCX. The two exchanges finalized the preliminary agreement announced in Montreal on Dec. 7, 2005 during the first meeting of the parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
.
On Oct. 2, 2006 the exchange said the federal government appeared to be moving in the right direction on emissions regulation.
[11]
On Oct. 23, 2006 the exchange promoted a market-based solution to help meet environmental challenges.
On May 10, 2007, the MX filed for regulatory approval of market rules for trading of MCeX environmental products.
On July 25, 2007, the Montreal Climate Exchange announced its
carbon futures
contract
would be launched by year end.
On March 14, 2008, the Montreal Climate Exchange announced plans to launch trading of
futures contracts
on
Canada carbon dioxide equivalent
(CO2e) units on May 30, 2008, subject to regulatory approval.

Indian princess
Rani
Shri
Amrit Kaur
Sahiba
of
Mandi
was born in 1904,
[1]
the only daughter of
Jagatjit Singh
Sahib Bahadur and his fourth wife, Rani Kanari Sahiba. Jagatjit reigned as
maharaja
between 1890 and 1947 in
Kapurthala
, northern
Punjab
.
Amrit received her education at a progressive girls' boarding school in
Eastbourne
, England, where she played tennis, led a five-piece jazz band and acted in plays. She was then sent to Paris. Amrit was given away in marriage in 1923 to the
Raja
of Mandi
Joginder Sen
Bahadur.
[2]
The couple toured Europe soon after their wedding, and were received in London by King
George V
and
Queen Mary
. After five months, they returned to Mandi, India, and the couple had a son and a daughter, Tikka Yashodan Singh (born 1923) and Princess Nirvana Devi (born 1929).
[3]
In an interview by the
New York Herald Tribune
in 1927, Amrit expressed determination to fight for the poorest and most marginalised women.
[4]
When her husband took a second wife, Amrit left India and her children for Paris in 1933 and never returned.
[1]
Kaur spent some time in the United States before returning to Paris just as World War II broke out.
[5]
She was arrested on 8 December 1940 by the
Gestapo
in
occupied Paris
"on the accusation of having sold her jewelry to help
Jews
leave" France and imprisoned in the
internment camp Besançon
.
[4]
Amrit's father wrote to the
British Foreign Office
and to
Marshal Pétain
, asking for help in obtaining her release. The Germans offered to exchange Amrit for one of their spies imprisoned in India, but a British official decided that her repatriation was "not of sufficient political importance" to justify such a deal.
[4]
Kaur died in London in 1948.

The first female Indian cabinet minister,
Amrit Kaur
, was her father's cousin.

was originally serialized in four installments
[2]
in the
pulp magazine
Black Mask
:

Plot summary
[
edit
]
The story is told in the
first person
, and the nameless detective known only as
The Continental Op
investigates a theft of diamonds from the Leggett family of San Francisco. The plot involves a supposed curse on the Dain family, said to inflict sudden and violent deaths upon those in their vicinity. Edgar Leggett's wife is a Dain, as is his daughter Gabrielle. The detective untangles a web of robberies, lies and murder. It is discovered that Gabrielle Leggett is under the influence of a mysterious religious
cult
and is also addicted to
morphine
.
Gabrielle escapes from the cult and marries her fiancé Eric Collinson, but bloodshed continues to follow her. The Continental Op, on behalf of four successive clients, investigates the reason behind all the mysterious, violent events surrounding Gabrielle Leggett, which he eventually uncovers.  The concluding chapters of the novel contain a detailed description of how the Op weans her from her drug habit, and the novel ends on a hopeful note.

Coburn said " “We went for a mood piece and a lot of it worked. For television, it was pretty good. Still, we had to fight the network (CBS) to make it the way we intended to do it. We didn’t want too many close-ups. They didn’t understand. They said this is television and that’s not the way to shoot it Well, I said, ‘fuck  ‘em, let’s shoot it like a film’, and you know what?, we did for the most part.”

Rhino Video Games
was a video game retailer headquartered in
Gainesville, Florida
before being sold to
GameStop
in 2007.  Rhino operated more than 90 games stores that carried classic games as well as newer products in fifteen states throughout the U.S. From 1989 to 2007, Rhino Video Games allowed customers to trade in their unwanted video games and systems toward other video game merchandise.
History
[
edit
]
Origins
[
edit
]
The first Rhino store was opened in 1989 in Ocala, Florida. Mike Vorce (founder and President), with the help of Bruce Ruckle, created a specialty video game store focused on buying, selling, trading, and renting video game software, systems, and accessories. By 1992, a second location was opened in Gainesville, which would become a flagship store and eventually the site for the company's corporate headquarters and distribution center. Vorce recruited Kelly Sharp (Senior Vice President) that year and together they oversaw all aspects of the company's growth, including operations, finance, HR, marketing, supply chain management, real estate, etc.
By 1996, Vorce and Sharp had expanded Rhino to five locations in Florida and enlisted Tully McQueen (Vice President of Operations) to assist in overseeing day to day store operations as they prepared for further expansion. This established the executive management trio that would continue to lead Rhino through future expansion, success, and acquisition by
Blockbuster, Inc.
In 1997, Rhino opened its first location outside of Florida, in Brunswick, GA. By 2004, Rhino Video Games had approximately 40 locations across six states in the southeast, employing over 300 people at its stores, corporate office, and distribution center, and attracted the interest of several potential buyers, including
GameStop
,
EB Games
, and Blockbuster.
Sale to GameStop
[
edit
]
On January 4, 2007, Rhino Video Games was acquired by
GameStop
and all stores were renamed by January 14th.

In 1993, there were 12 Soviet engineering units in Kazakhstan, and it became necessary to reorganize these units. In 1995, in
Kapshagay
, due to the reduction of 3 engineering units, an engineer regiment was formed and for its performance in 2003, it was the first in the history of the Armed Forces to be awarded the pennant of the Minister of Defense "For courage and military prowess". Similar regiments were formed in the Southern and Eastern Regional Commands. Due to the outflow of cadres from the country, the faculty of engineering troops was formed at the Almaty Higher Combined Arms Command School and since 1997, all military engineers have graduated from here.

Description
[
edit
]
Original description:
"Shell obconical, medium-sized to 70 mm, with a flat spire and acutely pointed double-whorl apex, consisting of eleven whorls, the first four post-nuclear ones distinctly stepped and obsoletely beaded; the next six having a flat top, ending with an undulating penultimate whorl causing its angulate shoulder to appear coronated. Surface of whorls are spirally striated with moderately channeled suture. The body whorl is subcylindrically elongate, with tapering straight sides, wrinkled with indistinct sulci at its base. The shell has a distinct waxy gloss with a ground colour of brownish pink and is encircled at its mid-section with a band of a paler shade. Coloration is also seen in violet and milky brown. The body whorl itself has no maculations, but the spire is sprinkled with dark brown blotches, some being arcuate, in an irregular pattern. The shell is comparatively light in weight with a tranchant outer lip; its aperture laterally narrow, lavender colored within."
[2]
The size of the shell varies between 32 mm and 80 mm.

The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
, commonly known as the
United Kingdom
(
UK
) or
Britain
,
[k]
[14]
is an
island country
in
Northwestern Europe
, off the north-western coast of the
continental mainland
.
[15]
It comprises
four countries
-
England
,
Scotland
,
Wales
, and
Northern Ireland
.
[l]
[16]
It includes the island of
Great Britain
, the north-eastern part of the island of
Ireland
, and most of the
smaller islands
within the
British Isles
.
[17]
Northern Ireland shares
a land border
with the
Republic of Ireland
; otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the
Atlantic Ocean
, the
North Sea
, the
English Channel
, the
Celtic Sea
and the
Irish Sea
. The total area of the United Kingdom is 93,628 square miles (242,495 km
2
), with an estimated 2022 population of nearly 67 million people.
The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The
Treaty of Union
between the
Kingdom of England
(which included
Wales
) and the
Kingdom of Scotland
in 1707 resulted in their unification to become the
Kingdom of Great Britain
. Its
union in 1801
with the
Kingdom of Ireland
created the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted its name in 1927.
[m]
The nearby
Isle of Man
,
Guernsey
and
Jersey
are not part of the UK, being
Crown Dependencies
, but the
British government
is responsible for their defence and international representation.
[18]
The UK became the first
industrialised
country and was the world's
foremost power
for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the "
Pax Britannica
" between 1815 and 1914.
[19]
[20]
The
British Empire
, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the
largest empire in history
; however, its involvement in the
First World War
and the
Second World War
damaged Britain's economic power and a global wave of
decolonisation
led to the independence of most British colonies.
[21]
[22]
[23]
British influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of
its former colonies
, and the
UK's culture
remains globally influential, particularly
in literature
,
music
and
sport
.
The United Kingdom is a
constitutional monarchy
and
parliamentary democracy
.
[n]
[25]
The capital and
largest city
of the United Kingdom (as well as the capital of England) is
London
. The cities of
Edinburgh
,
Cardiff
, and
Belfast
are respectively the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Other major cities include
Birmingham
,
Manchester
,
Glasgow
, and
Leeds
.
[26]
The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions:
England and Wales
,
Scotland
, and
Northern Ireland
. This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.
[27]
Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own
devolved governments and legislatures
, each with varying powers.
[28]
The UK has the world's
sixth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product
(GDP), and the
nineth-largest by purchasing power parity
. It is a recognised
nuclear state
and is ranked
fourth globally in military expenditure
.
[29]
[30]
The UK has been
a permanent member of
the
UN Security Council
since its first session in 1946. It is a member of the
Commonwealth of Nations
, the
Council of Europe
, the
G7
, the
OECD
,
NATO
, the
Five Eyes
,
AUKUS
and the
CPTPP
.
Etymology and terminology
See also:
Britain (place name)
and
Terminology of the British Isles
In
43 AD
,
Britannia
referred to the
Roman province
that encompassed modern
England and Wales
. Great Britain encompassed the whole island, taking in the land north of the
River Forth
known to the Romans as
Caledonia
in modern
Scotland
(i.e. "greater" Britain).
[31]
In the
Middle Ages
, the name "Britain" was also applied to a small part of
France
now known as
Brittany
. As a result,
Great Britain
(likely from the French "
Grande Bretagne
") came into use to refer specifically to the island, with
Brittany
often referred to as "Little Britain".
[32]
However, that name had no official significance until 1707, when the island's kingdoms of
England
and Scotland were united as the
Kingdom of Great Britain
.
[33]
The
Acts of Union 1707
declared that the
Kingdom of England
and
Kingdom of Scotland
were "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain".
[o]
[34]
The term "United Kingdom" has occasionally been used as a description for the former
Kingdom of Great Britain
, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply "Great Britain".
[35]
The
Acts of Union 1800
united the kingdoms of
Great Britain
and
Ireland
in 1801, forming the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
. Following the
partition of Ireland
and the independence of the
Irish Free State
in 1922, which left
Northern Ireland
as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
[36]
Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as
countries
.
[37]
The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a country" to describe the United Kingdom.
[16]
Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve
NUTS 1 regions
refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as "regions".
[38]
Northern Ireland is also referred to as a "province".
[39]
With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences".
[40]
The term "Great Britain" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.
[41]
It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.
[42]
The word
England
is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.
[43]
The
term "Britain"
is used as a synonym for
Great Britain
,
[44]
[45]
and the United Kingdom.
[46]
[45]
Usage is mixed: the
UK Government
prefers to use the term "UK" rather than "Britain" or "British" on its website (except when referring to embassies),
[47]
while acknowledging that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere "British government" is used at least as frequently as "United Kingdom government".
[48]
The UK
Permanent Committee on Geographical Names
recognises "United Kingdom", "UK" and "U.K." as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list "Britain" but notes that "it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland".
[48]
The
BBC
historically preferred to use "Britain" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that "Great Britain" excludes Northern Ireland.
[49]
The adjective "British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and
matters to do with nationality
.
[50]
People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being
British
,
English
,
Scottish
,
Welsh
,
Northern Irish
, or
Irish
;
[51]
or as having a combination of different national identities.
[52]
The official designation for a citizen of the United Kingdom is "British citizen".

Stonehenge
in
Wiltshire
is a ring of stones, each about 4 m (13 ft) high, 2 m (7 ft) wide and 25
tonnes
, erected 2400-2200 BC.
Settlement by
Cro-Magnons
of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago.
[53]
By the end of the
region's prehistoric period
, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed
Insular Celtic
, comprising
Brittonic Britain
and
Gaelic Ireland
.
[54]
The
Roman Baths
in
Bath, Somerset
, are a well-preserved
thermae
from
Roman Britain
.
The
Roman conquest
, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year
rule of southern Britain
, was followed by an invasion by
Germanic
Anglo-Saxon
settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly
to what was to become Wales
,
Cornwall
and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the
Hen Ogledd
(northern England and parts of southern Scotland).
[55]
Most of the
region settled by the Anglo-Saxons
became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.
[56]
Meanwhile,
Gaelic-speakers in north-west Britain
(with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century)
[57]
united with the
Picts
to create the
Kingdom of Scotland
in the 9th century.
[58]
The
Bayeux Tapestry
depicts the
Battle of Hastings
, 1066, and the events leading to it.
In 1066, the
Normans
invaded England from northern France. After
conquering England
, they seized
large parts of Wales
,
conquered much of Ireland
and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country
feudalism
on the Northern French model and
Norman-French
culture.
[59]
The
Anglo-Norman
ruling class
greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures.
[60]
Subsequent
medieval English kings
completed the
conquest of Wales
and tried unsuccessfully
to annex Scotland
. Asserting its independence in the 1320
Declaration of Arbroath
, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in
near-constant conflict with England
.
The English monarchs, through inheritance of
substantial territories in France
and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the
Hundred Years' War
, while the
Kings of Scots
were in
an alliance with the French
during this period.
[61]
Early modern Britain
saw religious conflict resulting from the
Reformation
and the introduction of
Protestant
state churches in each country.
[62]
The
English Reformation
ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and
established
the
Church of England
. Moreover, it defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs.
[63]
Wales was
fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England
,
[64]
and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.
[65]
In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and
given to Protestant settlers
from England and Scotland.
[66]
In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a
personal union
when
James VI, King of Scots
, inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from
Edinburgh
to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.
[67]
In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms
were involved in a series of connected wars
(including the
English Civil War
) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the
execution of King Charles I
, and the establishment of the short-lived
unitary republic
of the
Commonwealth of England
, Scotland and Ireland.
[68]
Although the
monarchy was restored
, the
Interregnum
along with the
Glorious Revolution
of 1688 and the subsequent
Bill of Rights 1689
in England and
Claim of Right Act 1689
in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe,
royal absolutism
would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The
British constitution
would develop on the basis of
constitutional monarchy
and the
parliamentary system
.
[69]
With the founding of the
Royal Society
in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of
naval power
and the interest in
voyages of discovery
led to the acquisition and settlement of
overseas colonies
, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.
[70]
Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the
Treaty of Union
of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.
Kingdom of Great Britain
Main articles:
Treaty of Union
and
Kingdom of Great Britain
The
Treaty of Union
led to a united kingdom of all of
Great Britain
.
On 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the
Acts of Union 1707
.
[71]
In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under
Robert Walpole
, in practice the first prime minister (1721-1742). A series of
Jacobite uprisings
sought to remove the Protestant
House of Hanover
from the throne and restore the Catholic
House of Stuart
. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the
Battle of Culloden
in 1746, after which the
Scottish Highlanders
were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of
clan chiefs
. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the
American War of Independence
became the
United States
, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to
India
.
[72]
Britain played a leading part in the
Atlantic slave trade
, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial
slave ships
transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.
[73]
The slaves were taken to work on
plantations
, principally in the
Caribbean
but also
North America
.
[74]
Slavery coupled with the
Caribbean sugar industry
had a significant role in strengthening the British economy in the 18th century.
[75]
However, with pressure from the
abolitionism movement
, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the
blockade of Africa
and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.

The opening engagement at the
Battle of Trafalgar
, by
J.W. Carmichael
After the defeat of France at the end of the
French Revolutionary Wars
and
Napoleonic Wars
(1792-1815), the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).
[78]
Unchallenged at sea
, British dominance was later described as
Pax Britannica
("British Peace"), a period of
relative peace among the Great Powers
(1815-1914) during which the
British Empire
became the global
hegemon
and adopted the role of global policeman.
[79]
By the time of
the Great Exhibition
of 1851, Britain was described as the "workshop of the world".
[80]
From 1853 to 1856, Britain took part in the
Crimean War
, allied with the
Ottoman Empire
against
Tsarist Russia
,
[81]
participating in the naval battles of the
Baltic Sea
known as the
Åland War
in the
Gulf of Bothnia
and the
Gulf of Finland
, among others.
[82]
Following the
Indian Rebellion in 1857
, the British government led by
Lord Palmerston
assumed
direct rule
over
India
. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively
controlled the economies
of regions such as
East Asia
and
Latin America
.
[83]
Victoria
reigned as
Queen of the United Kingdom
and
Empress of India
during the 19th century.
Throughout the
Victorian era
, political attitudes favoured
free trade
and
laissez-faire
policies, as well as a
gradual widening of the voting franchise
, with the
1884 Reform Act
championed by
William Gladstone
granting
suffrage
to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid
urbanisation
, causing significant social and economic stresses.
[84]
By the late 19th century, the
Conservatives
under
Benjamin Disraeli
and
Lord Salisbury
initiated a period of
imperial expansion in Africa
, maintained a policy of
splendid isolation
in Europe, and attempted to contain Russian influence in
Afghanistan
and
Persia
, in what came to be known as the
Great Game
.
[85]
During this time,
Canada
,
Australia
and
New Zealand
were granted self-governing
dominion
status.
[86]
At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the
German Empire
and the
United States
.
[87]
The
Edwardian era
saw
social reform
and
home rule for Ireland
become important domestic issues, while the
Labour Party
emerged from an alliance of
trade unions
and small socialist groups in 1900, and
suffragettes
campaigned for women's right to vote.

Britain was one of the principal
Allies
that defeated the
Central Powers
in the
First World War
(1914-1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts,
[89]
British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the
Western Front
.
[90]
The high fatalities of
trench warfare
caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.
[90]
The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections with the
Representation of the People Act 1918
.
[90]
After the war, Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the
League of Nations
and received a
mandate
over a number of former German and
Ottoman
colonies. Under the leadership of
David Lloyd George
, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.
[91]
By the mid-1920s, most of the British population could listen to
BBC
radio programmes.
[92]
[93]
Experimental television broadcasts
began in 1929
and the
first scheduled BBC Television Service
commenced in 1936.
[94]
The rise of
Irish nationalism
, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of
Irish Home Rule
, led eventually to the
partition of the island
in 1921.
[95]
The
Irish Free State
became independent, initially with
Dominion
status in 1922, and
unambiguously independent in 1931
. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.
[96]
The
1928 Equal Franchise Act
gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the
General Strike of 1926
, which ended in a victory for the government led by
Stanley Baldwin
. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the
Great Depression
(1929-1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A
coalition government
was formed in 1931.

[98]
After
Nazi Germany
invaded Poland in 1939, Britain entered the
Second World War
.
Winston Churchill
became prime minister and head of a
coalition government
in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its Empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.
[98]
In 1940, the
Royal Air Force
defeated the German
Luftwaffe
in the
Battle of Britain
. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during
the Blitz
. The
Grand Alliance
of Britain, the United States and the
Soviet Union
formed in 1941, leading the
Allies
against the
Axis powers
. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the
Battle of the Atlantic
, the
North Africa campaign
and the
Italian campaign
. British forces played important roles in the
Normandy landings
of 1944 and the
liberation of Europe
. The British Army led the
Burma campaign
against Japan, and the
British Pacific Fleet
fought Japan at sea. British scientists
contributed to the Manhattan Project
whose task was to build an atomic weapon.
[99]
Once built, it was decided, with British consent, to use the weapon against Japan.

The
British Empire
at its territorial peak in 1921
The UK was one of the
Big Three
powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world;
[101]
it was an original signatory to the
Declaration by United Nations
and became one of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council
. It worked closely with the United States to establish the
IMF
,
World Bank
and
NATO
.
[102]
The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the
Marshall Plan
,
[103]
but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe.
[104]
In the immediate post-war years, the
Labour government
under
Clement Attlee
initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly impacted British society
in the following decades
.
[105]
Major industries and public utilities were
nationalised
, a
welfare state
was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the
National Health Service
, was created.
[106]
The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of
decolonisation
was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.
[107]
Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the
Commonwealth of Nations
.
[108]

[109]
The UK was the third country to develop
a nuclear weapons arsenal
(with its first atomic bomb test,
Operation Hurricane
, in 1952), but the post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the
Suez Crisis
of 1956. The
international spread of the English language
ensured the continuing international influence of its
literature
and
culture
.
[110]
[111]
As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from
Commonwealth countries
. In the following decades, the UK became a more multi-ethnic society.
[112]
Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France,
West Germany
and Japan.
In the decades-long process of
European integration
, the UK was a founding member of the
Western European Union
, established with the
London and Paris Conferences
in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the
European Free Trade Association
(EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the
European Communities
(EC). In a
1975 referendum
67% voted to stay in it.
[113]
When the EC became the
European Union
(EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.
From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as
the Troubles
. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998
Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement
.

Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the
Conservative
government of the 1980s led by
Margaret Thatcher
initiated a radical policy of
monetarism
, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the
Big Bang
in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.
[115]
In 1982,
Argentina
invaded the British territories of
South Georgia
and the
Falkland Islands
, leading to the 10-week
Falklands War
in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a
2013 referendum
. From 1984, the UK economy was helped by the inflow of substantial
North Sea oil
revenues.
[116]
Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of
devolved
administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 244,820 square kilometres (94,530 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the
British Isles
[136]
archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the
English Channel
.
[137]
The
Royal Greenwich Observatory
in London was chosen as the defining point of the
Prime Meridian
[138]
at the
International Meridian Conference
in 1884.
[139]
The United Kingdom lies between latitudes
49°
and
61° N
, and longitudes
9° W
and
2° E
. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.
[137]
The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long.
[140]
It is connected to continental Europe by the
Channel Tunnel
, which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.
[141]
The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions:
Celtic broadleaf forests
,
English Lowlands beech forests
,
North Atlantic moist mixed forests
, and
Caledon conifer forests
.
[142]
The area of woodland in the UK in 2023 is estimated to be 3.25 million hectares, which represents 13% of the total land area in the UK.

Climate
Main articles:
Climate of the United Kingdom
and
Climate change in the United Kingdom
Köppen climate types
of the UK
Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round.
[137]
The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0
°C
(32
°F
) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F).
[144]
Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a
subpolar oceanic climate
(
Cfc
). Higher elevations in Scotland experience a
continental subarctic climate
(
Dfc
) and the mountains experience a
tundra climate
(
ET
).
[145]
The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,
[137]
although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the
Gulf Stream
, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.
[146]
The average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom is 1339.7 hours, which is just under 30% of the maximum possible.
[147]
The hours of sunshine vary from 1200 to about 1580 hours per year, and since 1996 the UK has been and still is receiving above the 1981 to 2010 average hours of sunshine.
[148]
As of 2022, the United Kingdom is ranked 2nd out of 180 countries in the
Environmental Performance Index
.
[149]
A law has been passed that
UK greenhouse gas emissions
will be
net zero
by 2050.

Topography
England
accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395 km
2
).
[151]
Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,
[152]
with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the
Tees-Exe line
which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include
Cornwall
, the
New Forest
, the
South Downs
and the
Norfolk Broads
. Upland areas include the
Lake District
, the
Pennines
, the
Yorkshire Dales
,
Exmoor
, and
Dartmoor
. The main rivers and estuaries are the
Thames
,
Severn
, and the
Humber
. England's highest mountain is
Scafell Pike
, at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the
Isle of Wight
.
The
Skiddaw massif
,
Keswick
and
Derwent Water
in the
Lake District
Skye
is one of the major islands in the
Inner Hebrides
and part of the
Scottish Highlands
.
Scotland
accounts for 32 per cent of the UK, covering 30,410 square miles (78,772 km
2
).
[153]
This includes nearly 800
islands
,
[154]
notably the
Hebrides
,
Orkney
Islands and
Shetland
Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK, the
Highlands
to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including the
Cairngorms
,
Loch Lomond and The Trossachs
and
Ben Nevis
which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)
[155]
is the highest point in the British Isles.
[156]
Wales
accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK, covering 8,020 square miles (20,779 km
2
).
[157]
Wales is mostly mountainous, though
South Wales
is less mountainous than
North
and
mid Wales
. The highest mountains in Wales are in
Snowdonia
and include
Snowdon
(
Welsh
:
Yr Wyddfa
) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales.
[152]
Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,704 kilometres) of coastline including the
Pembrokeshire Coast
.
[140]
Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is
Anglesey
(
Ynys Môn
).
Northern Ireland
, separated from Great Britain by the
Irish Sea
and
North Channel
, has an area of 5,470 square miles (14,160 km
2
) and is mostly hilly. It includes
Lough Neagh
which, at 150 square miles (388 km
2
), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area,
[158]
Lough Erne
which has over 150 islands and the
Giant's Causeway
which is a World Heritage Site. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is
Slieve Donard
in the
Mourne Mountains
at 852 metres (2,795 ft).

The UK is a
constitutional monarchy
and a
parliamentary democracy
operating under the
Westminster system
, otherwise known as a "democratic parliamentary monarchy".
[159]
It is a
centralised
,
unitary state
[160]
[161]
wherein the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
is
sovereign
.
[162]
Parliament is made up of the elected
House of Commons
, the appointed
House of Lords
and
the Crown
(as personified by the
monarch
).
[p]
[165]
The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses,
[165]
but
royal assent
is required for a bill to become an
act of parliament
(that is,
statute law
).
[166]
As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the
British constitution
is
uncodified
, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary
statutes
, judge-made
case law
and international treaties, together with
constitutional conventions
.
[167]
Nevertheless, the
Supreme Court
recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as
parliamentary sovereignty
, the
rule of law
,
democracy
, and upholding
international law
.
[168]
King Charles III
is the current
monarch
and
head of state
of the UK and of 14 other independent countries. These 15 countries are today referred to as "
Commonwealth realms
". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is "...fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK."
[169]
The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the
royal prerogative
, is generally exercised only on the
advice
of
ministers of the Crown
responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties, the monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn".
[170]
In addition, the monarch has a number of
reserve powers
at his disposal, albeit rarely used, to uphold
responsible government
and prevent
constitutional crises
.
[q]
The
Palace of Westminster
in London is the seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
For
general elections
(elections to the House of Commons), the UK is currently divided into 650
constituencies
, each of which is represented by one
member of Parliament
(MP) elected by the
first-past-the-post
system.
[172]
MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.
[172]
The
Conservative Party
, colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the
Labour Party
have been the dominant political parties in the UK since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a
two-party system
. However, since the 1920s other
political parties
have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.
[173]
The
prime minister
is the
head of government
in the UK.
[174]
Acting under the direction and supervision of a
Cabinet
of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, the
Government
serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the
Privy Council
, promulgates
statutory instruments
and tenders advice to the monarch.
[175]
[176]
[177]
Nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as
First Lord of the Treasury
[178]
and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905,
[179]
Minister for the Civil Service
since 1968,
[180]
and
Minister for the Union
since 2019.
[181]
While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by
convention
, an MP, the leader of the
political party
with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons.
[182]
[183]
[184]
The current Prime Minister, as of October 2022, is
Rishi Sunak
MP, leader of the
Conservative Party
.
Administrative divisions
Main articles:
Countries of the United Kingdom
,
Administrative geography of the United Kingdom
, and
List of counties in the United Kingdom
The geographical division of the United Kingdom into
counties
or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period.
[185]
Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in
1888
, Scotland in
1889
and Ireland in
1898
, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK.
[186]
Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.
[187]
Local government in England
is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier
subdivisions of England
are the nine
regions
, now used primarily for statistical purposes.
[188]
One of the regions,
Greater London
, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a
1998 referendum
.
[189]
Local government in Scotland
is divided into
32 council areas
with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of
Glasgow
, Edinburgh,
Aberdeen
and
Dundee
are separate council areas, as is the
Highland Council
, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.
[190]
Local government in Wales
consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right.
[191]
Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.
[191]
Local government in Northern Ireland
since 1973, has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.
[192]
In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system.

Scottish Government
and
Parliament
have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically
reserved
to the UK Parliament, including

[203]
The Senedd is able to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament through
Acts of Senedd Cymru
. The current

Local government in Wales
consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.
Northern Ireland
Main articles:
Northern Ireland Assembly
,

,
Local government in Northern Ireland
, and
The Troubles
Since 1998, Northern Ireland has a devolved government, the
Executive
, and legislature, the
Assembly
. Elections to the Assembly use the
single transferable vote
system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a
diarchy
representing
unionist
and
nationalist
members of the Assembly.
[204]
The
Island of Ireland
has a turbulent and violent modern political history, a period referred to as
the Troubles
. The 1998
Good Friday Agreement
acts as a
de facto
constitution
for Northern Ireland.
Local government in Northern Ireland
since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.
[192]
Constitutional arrangement
The UK does not have a
codified constitution
and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of
parliamentary sovereignty
, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.
[205]
In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, because these institutions were created by referendum decisions.
[206]
The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the
Government of Ireland
.
[207]
The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative competence in economic areas through an act passed in 2020.

which is a British organisation based in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. The UK is said to have a "
Special Relationship
" with the United States and a close partnership with France - the "
Entente cordiale
" - and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries;
[209]
[210]
the
Anglo-Portuguese Alliance
is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a
Common Travel Area
and co-operate through the
British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference
and the
British-Irish Council
. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments,
official development assistance
and military engagements.

[214]
form 'one undivided Realm'.
[215]
[216]
All parts of the realm are under the sovereignty of the
British Crown
, but the Territories and Dependencies are not part of the UK. This is distinct from the status of
Commonwealth realms
, who have separate monarchies, but share the same monarch.

Collectively Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 480,000 square nautical miles (640,000 sq mi; 1,600,000 km
2
),
[219]
with a total population of approximately 250,000.
[220]
The overseas territories also give the UK the world's fifth largest
exclusive economic zone
at 6,805,586 km
2
(2,627,651 sq mi).
[221]
The Crown Dependencies are possessions of
the Crown
, as opposed to territories of the UK.
[222]
They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Bailiwicks of
Jersey
and of
Guernsey
in the English Channel, and the
Isle of Man
in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as "territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible".
[223]
The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (
Privy Council
or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor).
[224]
Since 2005, each Crown dependency has had a
Chief Minister
as its
head of government
.

The
Supreme Court
is the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and civil cases in Scotland.
The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the
1706 Treaty of Union
provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system.
[226]
Today the UK has three distinct
systems of law
:
English law
,
Northern Ireland law
and
Scots law
. A new
Supreme Court of the United Kingdom
came into being in October 2009 to replace the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords
.
[227]
The
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the
British Overseas Territories
and the
Crown Dependencies
.
[228]
Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and
Northern Ireland law
are based on
common-law
principles.
[229]
The
courts of England and Wales
are headed by the
Senior Courts of England and Wales
, consisting of the
Court of Appeal
, the
High Court of Justice
(for civil cases) and the
Crown Court
(for criminal cases).
[230]
Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and
civil-law
principles. The chief courts are the
Court of Session
, for civil cases,
[231]
and the
High Court of Justiciary
, for criminal cases.
[232]
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.
[233]
Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 per cent in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015,
[234]
according to
crime statistics
. The
prison population of England and Wales
has increased to 86,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 148 per 100,000.
[235]
Same-sex marriage
has been legal in England, Scotland, and Wales since 2014, and in

In 2021, the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer of energy and the 22nd-largest producer.
[295]
The UK is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies -
BP
and
Shell
.
[296]
The total of all renewable electricity sources provided 43% of the electricity generated in the UK in 2020.
[297]
The UK is
one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy
, and wind power production is the country's fastest-growing supply; in 2022, 26.8% of the UK's total electricity was generated by wind power.
[298]
The UK has the largest offshore wind farm in the world, which is located off the coast of Yorkshire.
[299]
In 2023, the UK had 9 nuclear reactors normally generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity.
[300]
Unlike Germany and Japan, there are two reactors under construction and more planned.
[301]
[302]
In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in
Small Modular Reactors
and
Advanced Modular Reactors
research and development.
In 2021, the UK produced 935 thousand
barrels
per day (bbl/d) of oil (and other liquids) and consumed 1,258 thousand bbl/d.
[295]
Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005.

In 2020, the UK produced 1.8 million tonnes of coal falling 91% in 10 years.
[300]
In 2020 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 26 million tonnes.
[300]
The UK
Coal Authority
has stated that there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through
underground coal gasification
(UCG) or '
fracking'
,
[305]
and based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.

In the
2011 census
the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775.
[310]
It is the
fourth-largest
in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the
22nd-largest
in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth.
[311]
Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent.
[310]
The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0-14 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent.
[310]
In 2018 the
median age
of the UK population was 41.7 years.
[312]
England's population in 2011 was 53 million, representing some 84 per cent of the UK total.
[313]
It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 420 people per square kilometre in mid-2015,
[311]
with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.
[314]
The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million,
[315]
Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million.
[313]
In 2017 the average
total fertility rate
(TFR) across the UK was 1.74 children born per woman.
[316]
While a rising birth rate is contributing to population growth, it remains considerably below the
baby boom
peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964,
[317]
or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815,
[318]
below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.
[319]
In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women.
[320]
The
Office for National Statistics
reported in 2015 that out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with "other", "I don't know", or did not respond.
[321]

Ethnicity
Main article:
Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom
Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be
descended from the various ethnic groups
that settled there before the 12th century: the
Celts
, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the
Normans
.
Welsh people
could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.
[326]
The UK has a history of non-white immigration with
Liverpool
having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000
[327]
which later declined due to the abolition of slavery.
[328]
The UK also has the oldest
Chinese
community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.
[329]
In
2011
, 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an
ethnic minority
group.
[330]
Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4 per cent of London's population and 37.4 per cent of
Leicester
's was estimated to be non-white in 2005
,
[331]
whereas less than 5 per cent of the populations of
North East England
, Wales and the
South West
were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.
[332]
In 2016
, 31.4 per cent of primary and 27.9 per cent of secondary pupils at
state schools
in England were members of an ethnic minority.
[333]
Languages
Main article:
Languages of the United Kingdom
The
English language
is the official and most spoken language of the United Kingdom that originated from
England
.
[334]
[335]
The United Kingdom proactively promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide.
[336]
[337]
It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are
monolingual
English speakers.
[338]
5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.
[338]
South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes
Punjabi
,
Urdu
,
Bengali
,
Sylheti
,
Hindi
and
Gujarati
.
[339]
According to the 2011 census,
Polish
has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers.
[340]
In 2019, some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.
[341]
Bilingual sign
(
Irish
and
English
) in
Newry
,
Northern Ireland
Three indigenous
Celtic languages
are spoken in the UK:
Welsh
,
Irish
and
Scottish Gaelic
.
Cornish
, which became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has a small group of second language speakers.
[342]
[2]
According to the
2021 census
, the
Welsh-speaking population
of Wales aged three or older was 538,300 people (17.8 per cent).
[343]
In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.
[344]
In the 2011 census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4 per cent) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see
Irish language in Northern Ireland
), almost exclusively in the
nationalist
(mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the
Outer Hebrides
.
[345]
The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing.
[346]
Scots
, a language descended from early northern
Middle English
, has limited
recognition
alongside its regional variant,
Ulster Scots
in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion.
[2]
[347]
As of April 2020, there are said to be around 151,000 users of
British Sign Language
(BSL), a
sign language
used by deaf people, in the UK.

Forms of
Christianity
have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 years.
[350]
Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,
[351]
while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam.
[352]
This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith,
[353]
secularised
,
[354]
or
post-Christian
society.
[355]
In the 2001 census, 71.6 per cent of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being
Islam
(2.8 per cent),
Hinduism
(1.0 per cent),
Sikhism
(0.6 per cent),
Judaism
(0.5 per cent),
Buddhism
(0.3 per cent) and all other religions (0.3 per cent).
[356]
Of the respondents, 15 per cent stated that they had
no religion
and a further 7 per cent did not state a religious preference.
[357]
A
Tearfund
survey in 2007 showed that only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly.
[358]
Between the 2001 and 2011 census, there was a 12 per cent decrease in the number of people who identified as Christian, while the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 per cent.
[359]
The
Muslim population
has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the UK.
[360]
The Church of England is the
established church
in England.
[361]
It retains a
representation
in the UK Parliament, and the British monarch is its
Supreme Governor
.
[362]
In
Scotland
, the
Church of Scotland
is recognised as the
national church
. It is not subject to state control, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to "maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and
Presbyterian Church Government
" upon his or her accession.
[363]
[2]
[364]
The
Church in Wales
was disestablished in 1920 and, because the
Church of Ireland
was disestablished in 1870 before the
partition of Ireland
, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.
[365]
Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as
Plymouth Brethren
, and
Orthodox
churches.

Immigration is now contributing to a rising UK population,
[367]
with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. According to official statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK.
[368]
The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000.
[369]
In 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common previous nationalities of those naturalised in 2014 were Indian, Pakistani,
Filipino
,
Nigerian
,
Bangladeshi
,
Nepali
, Chinese, South African, Polish and
Somali
.
[370]
The total number of grants of settlement, which confer
permanent residence
in the UK but not citizenship,
[371]
was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years.
[370]
Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe.
[372]
Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad,
[373]
[374]
mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.

The modern-system of
universal
publicly funded
in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the
National Health Service
(NHS) in 1949 which still exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a "national religion".
[380]
[381]
Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a
devolved matter
and each country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is provided to all
UK permanent residents
and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from
general taxation
. The
World Health Organization
, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.
[382]
Since 1979, expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly.
[383]
The 2018
OECD
data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending £3,121 per head.
[384]
In 2017 the UK spent £2,989 per person on healthcare, around the median for members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
.
[385]
Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the
General Medical Council
, the
Nursing and Midwifery Council
and non-governmental-based, such as the
Royal Colleges
. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national
executives
;
healthcare in England
is the responsibility of the UK Government;
healthcare in Northern Ireland
is the responsibility of the
Northern Ireland Executive
;
healthcare in Scotland
is the responsibility of the
Scottish Government
; and
healthcare in Wales
is the responsibility of the
Welsh Government
. Each
National Health Service
has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.

Music
Main article:
Music of the United Kingdom
The Proms
is a classical music festival held at the
Royal Albert Hall

Edward Elgar
and
Henry Wood
.
Various styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the indigenous
folk music
of
England
,
Wales
,
Scotland
and
Northern Ireland
. Historically, there has been exceptional Renaissance music from the
Tudor period
, with masses, madrigals and lute music by
Thomas Tallis

Orlando Gibbons
and
John Dowland
. After the
Stuart Restoration
, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by
Henry Purcell
, followed by
Thomas Arne
and others. The German-born composer
George Frideric Handel
became a
naturalised
British citizen
in 1727, when he composed the anthem
Zadok the Priest

coronation of George II
; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous
Messiah
, were written in the English language.

In the second half of the 19th century, as
Arthur Sullivan
and his librettist
W. S. Gilbert
wrote their popular
Savoy operas

folk music
, notably
Gustav Holst
,
Ralph Vaughan Williams
, and
Benjamin Britten
, a pioneer of modern British opera. Among the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have made their own personal choice of musical identity:
Peter Maxwell Davies
(Orkney),
Harrison Birtwistle
(mythological), and
John Tavener
(religious).
[411]

facilitated a knowledge of
Indian cuisine
with its "strong, penetrating spices and herbs". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have
settled in Britain
, producing hybrid dishes, such as
chicken tikka masala
.

A Small Town in Germany
is a 1968
espionage novel
by British author
John le Carré
.  It is set in
Bonn
, the "small town" of the title, against a background of concern that former
Nazis
were returning to positions of power in
West Germany
.
[1]
[2]
It is notable for being le Carré's first novel not to feature his recurring protagonist
George Smiley
or "The Circus," le Carré's fictionalised version of
MI6
.
Setting
[
edit
]
Bonn
, the eponymous small town, was chosen as West Germany's capital after
World War II
mainly due to the advocacy of
Konrad Adenauer
,
Chancellor of West Germany
after World War II.
Plot summary
[
edit
]
The novel is set in the late 1960s, in Bonn, the capital of West Germany. Great Britain is hoping to gain support from the West German government in a bid to enter the
European common market
. From
London
, Alan Turner, an official from the
British Foreign Office
, arrives to investigate the disappearance of Leo Harting, a minor British Embassy officer; moreover, secret files have disappeared with him. The embassy's head of
Chancery
, Rawley Bradfield, is hostile to Turner's investigation. Despite that, he is dinner party host to Turner and Ludwig Siebkron, head of the
German Interior Ministry
; the latter is close to industrialist Klaus Karfeld, who is successfully building a new nationalist political movement which is anti-British and anti-Western European, and which seeks to turn West Germany away from Western Europe and bring it closer to Communist Eastern Europe. Great Britain's diplomatic mission perceives growing support for Karfeld's movement as a threat to obtaining support for Britain's entry into the Common Market.
Initially, Turner suspects Harting is a spy, probably working for a Communist government. He comes to discover that Harting had once been a war crime investigator in Germany and he has been secretly using Chancery resources to continue investigating Karfeld's career as the war-time administrator of a Nazi laboratory that poisoned 31
half-Jews
, crimes for which Karfeld had been investigated but for which he escaped responsibility. Harting is, in fact, hiding from Siebkron, who is aware of Karfeld's crimes and seeks to protect him from being exposed. To Turner's chagrin, Bradfield is unsympathetic to Harting's circumstances and uninterested in protecting him because he considers him a criminal and a political embarrassment.
Turner discovers that Harting recently learned Karfeld is immune from prosecution due to the statute of limitations. Turner deduces that a violent incident at a recent Karfeld rally, in which a mob stormed a British library and fatally assaulted the female librarian- revealed to be Harting's ex-girlfriend- occurred because Harting had attempted to shoot Karfeld from a window of the library. Turner believes Harting may try again to assassinate Karfeld at his next rally, which Turner and Bradfield attend.
The novel ends with Karfeld addressing the rally and delivering an anti-Western European, Nazi-apologist speech until violence erupts between his supporters and a group of socialist counter-protestors. In the ensuing chaos, Harting attempts to shoot Karfeld but misses; Karfeld's supporters kill him as Turner rushes to his aid. As Turner watches helplessly, they search his body for the last pieces of incriminating evidence against Karfeld.

Rawley Bradfield - Head of Chancery at the British Embassy in Bonn
Leo Harting - long-term temporary employee at the British Embassy
Alan Turner - British Foreign Office official

Writing
[
edit
]
Le Carré was initially unhappy with the book, later writing in the foreword to a 1991 reprinting that the novel "is printed with aversion in my memory".
[3]
In the same foreword, le Carré revealed that he based the hostile, reactionary Turner on himself, admitting that he was going through a
nervous breakdown
at the time of writing due to the dissolution of his marriage; he would ultimately stop work on the book for a period to deal with his personal life before returning to it later. For a period, he believed the book would be his farewell to espionage fiction, following it up with a semi-autobiographical literary novel he intended to restart his career,
The Naive and Sentimental Lover
. In retrospect, he wrote there that "the novel is not the eyesore I always imagine it to be". John le Carré said that his intention was "to write something close to a black comedy about British political manners, and yet the result was widely perceived to be ferociously
anti-German
". He said that he wanted to write "an informed nightmare, not an accurate prophecy. My aim was to tell what I might best call a political ghost story". Leo Harting is the ghost, Alan Turner is his
exorcist
and Bradfield is the owner of the
haunted house
. While most of the characters were original creations, le Carré wrote that Leo was directly based on a man he knew during his diplomatic service whom he referred to only as "Herr Junger," an "embassy fixer" who was able to acquire discount goods for the staff using his various contacts in other embassies.
He created the first drafts of the book in Vienna, where
Simon Wiesenthal
helped him with Karfeld's background.
Allusions/references to actual events
[
edit
]
David Cornwell (John le Carré) worked as an intelligence officer for
MI6
under diplomatic cover as the 'Second Secretary' of the British embassy in Bonn, during the period depicted in this novel.
At the time of publication there were worries that the
extreme right
was rebuilding in West Germany, particularly with the success of the far-right
National Democratic Party
in various state and municipal elections after its founding. However, these fears later proved to be unfounded.
West German Chancellor
Kurt Georg Kiesinger
, was, like Karfeld, a former Nazi, who had joined the Nazi Party in 1933. Although Kiesinger was cleared of war crimes by the
denazification
courts, radical groups such as the
Red Army Faction
argued that an informal but powerful network of ex-Nazis, including Kiesinger, controlled the country.
Real locations in Bonn such as the British Embassy feature prominently.

Black Beauty: His Grooms and Companions, the Autobiography of a Horse
is an 1877 novel by English author
Anna Sewell
. It was composed in the last years of her life, during which she was bedridden and seriously ill.
[1]
The novel became an immediate best-seller, with Sewell dying just five months after its publication, but having lived long enough to see her only novel become a success. With fifty million copies sold,
Black Beauty
is one of the
best-selling books
of all time.
[2]
While forthrightly teaching
animal welfare
, it also teaches how to treat people with kindness, sympathy, and respect. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 58 on the BBC's survey
The Big Read
.
[3]
It is seen as a forerunner of the
pony book
.
Background
Anna Sewell was born in
Great Yarmouth
, England, and had a brother named Philip, who was an engineer in Europe. At the age of 14, Anna fell while walking home from school in the rain and injured both ankles.
[4]
Through the mistreatment of the injury, she became unable to walk or stand for any length of time for the rest of her life. Disabled and unable to walk, she began learning about horses, spending many hours driving her father to and from the station from which he commuted to work. Her dependence on horse-drawn transportation fostered her respect for horses.
[2]
Sewell's introduction to writing began in her youth when she helped edit the works of her mother,
Mary Wright Sewell
(1797-1884), a deeply religious, popular author of juvenile best-sellers.
Anna Sewell never married or had children. In visits to European spas, she met many writers, artists, and philanthropists. Her only book was
Black Beauty
, written between 1871 and 1877 in her house at
Old Catton
. During this time, her health was declining, and she could barely get out of bed. Her dearly-loved mother often had to help her with her illness. She sold the book to the local publishers,
Jarrold & Sons
. The book broke records for sales and is the "sixth best seller in the English language."
[5]
By telling the story of a horse's life in the form of an autobiography and describing the world through the eyes of the horse, Anna Sewell broke new literary ground.
[6]
Sewell died of
hepatitis
or
tuberculosis
on 25 April 1878, only five months after the novel was published, but she lived long enough to see its initial success.
[4]
She was buried on 30 April 1878 in the
Quaker
burial-ground at Lammas near
Buxton, Norfolk
, where a wall plaque marks her resting place. Her birthplace in Church Plain,
Great Yarmouth
, is now a museum.
[7]
Although
Black Beauty
is looked at as a children's novel, Sewell did not write the novel for children. She said that her purpose in writing the novel was "to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses"
[1]
—an influence she attributed to an essay on animals she read earlier by
Horace Bushnell
(1802-1876) entitled "Essay on Animals".
[8]
Her sympathetic portrayal of the plight of
working animals
led to a vast outpouring of concern for animal welfare and is said to have been instrumental in the abolition of the cruel practice of using the checkrein (or "
bearing rein
", a strap used to keep horses' heads high, fashionable in
Victorian England
but painful and damaging to a horse's neck).
[6]
Black Beauty
also mentions the use of
blinkers
on horses, concluding that this use is likely to cause accidents at night due to interference with "the full use of" a horse's ability to "see much better in the dark than men can."
Plot summary
The story is narrated in the
first person
as an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named Black Beauty—beginning with his carefree days as a foal on an English farm with his mother, to his difficult life pulling cabs in London, to his happy retirement in the country. Along the way, he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness. Each short chapter recounts an incident in Black Beauty's life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment of horses, with Sewell's detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of
verisimilitude
.
[1]
The book describes conditions among London horse-drawn
cab
drivers, including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low, legally fixed
fares
. A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day cab licences (not allowed to trade on Sundays) and 7-day cab licences (allowed to trade on Sundays) was abolished and the cab licence fee was much reduced.
Genre
Black Beauty
is considered to be one of the first fictional animal autobiographies.
[9]
Originally meant to be informative literature read by adults on the norms of horse cruelty and preventions of these unjust acts,
Black Beauty
is now seen as a children's book.
[10]
Narrated by the main character, Black Beauty, the novel is read by thousands of children worldwide.
[11]
Analysis
Sewell uses
anthropomorphism
in
Black Beauty
. The text advocates the fairer treatment of horses in Victorian England. The story is narrated from Black Beauty's perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the "
bearing rein
" and "
blinkers
" as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses. For instance, Ginger describes the physical effects of the "bearing rein" to Black Beauty, by stating, "it is dreadful... your neck aching until you don't know how to bear it... its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips".
[12]
Tess Coslett highlights that Black Beauty's story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves. The horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics, like love and loyalty, which are similar to those of human beings. Coslett emphasizes that, while
Black Beauty
is not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography, it is a novel that "allows the reader to slide in and out of horse-consciousness, blurring the human/animal divide".
[13]
Dwyer suggests that  "by the end of the nineteenth century the concern for animal welfare was often mediated by considerations of utility", implying that these animals (horses) were seen to get the job done by any means rather than the approach that they could be demonizing the animal.
[14]
[
clarification needed
]
Publications
Published in 1877, in the last years of Anna Sewell's life,
Black Beauty
sold over 50 million copies worldwide in 50 different languages.
[15]
This different viewpoint sparked people's interest to speak for horses' well-being and implement legislation.
[16]
According to Sewell, providing information was her original goal of horse injustice.
[1]
Although the shift of perspectives was seen as good for some, it was also an issue to others including horse owners and people who sold such equipment for horses (equipment like blinders).
[17]
It has been alleged that
Black Beauty
was banned in some countries, e.g. South Africa, for containing the words "Black" and "Beauty" during its apartheid restrictions on African natives.
[18]
However, Claire Datnow, in her memoir
Behind the Walled Garden of Apartheid: Growing up White in Segregated South Africa
,
[19]
writes that this "fact" was a standing joke among her circle of friends, invented to make fun of the "ignorance of the censors"—the idea being that
Black Beauty
had been banned "because the censors thought it referred to a black woman."
Reception
Upon publication of the book, many readers related to the pain of the victimized horses, sympathized and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well-being of horses. Two years after the release of the novel, one million copies of
Black Beauty
were in circulation in the United States.
[20]
In addition, animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables.
[21]
The depiction of the "bearing rein" in
Black Beauty
spurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in Victorian England, but public interest in anti-cruelty legislation in the United States also grew significantly. The arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses in
Black Beauty
inspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals.
[22]
The impact of the novel is still very much recognized today. Writing in the
Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare
, Bernard Unti calls
Black Beauty
"the most influential anti-cruelty novel of all time".
[23]
Comparisons have also been made between
Black Beauty
and the most important
social protest novel
in the United States,
Uncle Tom's Cabin
, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society.

Darkie (Black Beauty)/Black Auster/Jack/Blackie/Old Crony: The narrator of the story, a handsome black horse. He begins his career as a carriage horse for wealthy people but when he "breaks his knees" (i.e. develops scars on the fronts of his wrist (
carpal
) joints after a bad fall) he is no longer considered presentable enough and is put to much harder work. He passes through the hands of a series of owners, some cruel, some kind. He always tries his best to serve humans despite the circumstances.
Duchess (nicknamed "Pet"): Beauty's and Rob Roy's mother, who encourages Beauty to be good from a young age.
Rob Roy: A fellow black horse from Beauty's original farm, who is killed in a hunting incident (along with his rider, Squire Gordon's only son). It is later learned that he was Beauty's half-brother, an older son of Duchess.
Lizzie: A high-strung, nervous mare whom Lady Anne rides one day and is spooked until Black Beauty comes to her aid with his rider.
Ginger: A companion of Beauty's at Birtwick Park, she is named for her chestnut colour and her habit of biting, which is often how the spice,
ginger
, is described. Ginger is a more aggressive horse due to her traumatic upbringing. After being ridden by Lord George in a
steeplechase
her
back
is strained. Beauty and Ginger meet for the last time as broken-down cab horses in London, and later a cart carrying a dead horse (whom Beauty believes is Ginger), passes by Beauty.
Merrylegs: A short, dappled grey, handsome pony who is polite to humans and horses alike. He is ridden by the young daughters at Birtwick Park, then sent to live with a vicar who promises never to sell him.
Sir Oliver: An older horse whose tail was
docked
, to his great annoyance and discomfort.
Rory: A job horse usually paired with Black Beauty. Became a coal carting horse after getting hit in the chest by a cart driven on the wrong side of the road.
Peggy: A hired horse who cannot run very fast due to her short legs. She runs at an odd hopping pace between a trot and a canter when expected to keep pace with other horses at a fast trot. When paired with a faster horse to pull a carriage she often gets whipped for not keeping up. Sold to two ladies who wanted a safe horse.
Unnamed young horse: paired with Beauty after Peggy leaves. Often frightened by things he cannot see as he does not know whether they are dangerous or not.
Captain: A former army horse who witnessed horrific incidents in the
Crimean War
, although he was well treated and received no serious wounds. He lost his beloved master in the
Charge of the Light Brigade
. He became a cab-horse for Jerry, where he works with Black Beauty. After a penetrating shoulder injury from a carriage pole due to a collision with a carriage whose driver was drunk, Jerry has him shot rather than send him to work as a cart-horse.
Hotspur: A five-year-old horse bought to replace Captain. Jerry sells him to Grant when he leaves London.
Justice: A calm peaceful horse that Beauty meets at Birtwick Park.
Beauty's owners
This copy of the first edition of the book was dedicated by the author to her mother. It was auctioned off at
Christie's
in London in June 2006 for £33,000.
Part 1
Farmer Grey: Beauty's first owner, a good kind man who trains him well.
Mr. Douglas Gordon (Squire Gordon): A very kind and loving master who was also the squire. Lives in Birtwick Park. Has to sell Beauty and Ginger when he leaves the country because of his wife's illness.
Mr. John Manly: Black Beauty's groom at Squire Gordon's.
Mr. James Howard: John Manly's assistant at Squire Gordon's. He leaves to work as a coachman for Sir Clifford Williams.
Mr. Joseph Green (Joe): A kind boy who replaces James at Squire Gordon's hall. Beauty becomes seriously ill after little Joe gives Beauty a pail of cold water to drink and then assumes Beauty does not need a blanket, all after a long, exhausting gallop.
Bill: A boy who keeps thrashing and whipping a pony to attempt to make him jump a fence.
Mrs. Bushby: Bill's mother who is worried when she hears that he fell into a bush.
Part 2
Earl of W: Purchases Beauty and Ginger from Squire Gordon. Lives in Earlshall Park.
Lady W: Wife of Lord W. Demands that Beauty and Ginger wear bearing reins to hold their heads up high. When York tries to comply with Lady W's order Ginger lashes out, kicking everything around her.
Mr. York: Earl of W's coachman. He treats the horses kindly but is scared to speak for the horses.
Reuben Smith: A first-rate driver who can treat a horse as well as a
farrier
, due to spending two years with a veterinary surgeon, and being an ostler at an inn. Unfortunately he occasionally drinks heavily. Though York tries to hide this problem, the Earl finds out and fires Reuben. York later convinces the Earl to rehire him. After taking Colonel Blantyre to town Reuben gets drunk in the
White Lion
, then rides Beauty back to Earlshall Park. Due to a loose nail in Beauty's
shoe
, which Reuben was too drunk to care about, Beauty's shoe comes off. Reuben then makes Beauty gallop over sharp stones injuring Beauty's hoof and causing him to stumble. Beauty falls and scrapes his knees, while Reuben is flung off Beauty and dies from a
broken neck
.
Master of the livery stables: Buys Beauty and hires him out to people in
Bath
who wish to rent a horse. Some of the people who rent Beauty are good drivers, most are not.
Mr. Barry: Buys Beauty from the livery stables after his friend rents Beauty several times, as his doctor advised him to get more horse exercise. He tries to treat horses well but hires two bad grooms (a
thief
and a
humbug
) due to his lack of knowledge on horse care. Decides to sell Beauty at a horse fair.
Part 3
Mr. Jeremiah (Jerry) Barker: A kind owner and religious man who uses Beauty and Captain as cab horses. After Captain is injured he buys Hotspur to replace him. Refuses to work on Sunday or force his horses to go beyond a 'jog-trot' through London for customers with poor timekeeping, although he will break these rules for a good cause. One New Year's Eve, Jerry is kept waiting in blizzard conditions by inconsiderate young men who stayed too long playing cards, contracts
bronchitis
, and nearly dies. Jerry's doctor tells him he must not return to cab work. Jerry takes a job with Mrs. Fowler as her coachman.
Mrs. Polly Barker: Wife of Jerry. Always waits up for her husband.
Mr. Harry Barker: Son of Jerry. Helps his father look after the horses.
Miss Dorothy (Dolly) Barker: Daughter of Jerry. Often brings food to her father.
Mr. (Grey / Governor) Grant: a respected and long-serving cab driver. When Jerry is ill he takes out Hotspur and gives Jerry half the money he makes.
Part 4
Corn dealer/baker  Steven: Uses Beauty as a workhorse. Works him fairly but due to the poor lighting in Beauty's stable Beauty nearly goes blind.
Foreman: Has Beauty overloaded so that fewer journeys are required to deliver goods.
Mr. Jakes: A carter who works for the baker. Dislikes overloading Beauty but cannot go against the foreman. Makes Beauty work with the bearing rein up until a lady shows him that Beauty would find it easier to pull the cart without the bearing rein.
Mr. Nicholas Skinner: A ruthless cab-horse owner who charges a high fee for renting cab horses. As a result, the only way the drivers who rent his horse can make money is by overworking the horse, usually by whipping the horse to make it move even when tired. When Beauty collapses from overwork, Skinner plans to send Beauty to a
knacker
but a farrier convinces him to rest Beauty and sell him at a horse fair. Seedy Sam used to rent horses from him.
Willie: Grandson of Farmer Thoroughgood who wants to help Black Beauty when he comes to the market with his grandfather.
Farmer Thoroughgood: A kind owner who cares for Black Beauty when he is at his weakest.
The three ladies: Beauty's final home, where he spends the rest of his days very well treated. The ladies are Miss Blomefield, Miss Ellen, and Miss Lavinia and are most likely sisters.
Joseph (Joe) Green: Coachman for the three ladies. Recognizes Beauty as the horse that used to belong to Squire Gordon.

Beautiful Joe
was a best-selling 1893 novel about a dog that was directly influenced by
Black Beauty
and followed a similar path to fame through awareness of cruelty to animals.
The Strike at Shane's: A Prize Story of Indiana
is an anonymous American novel that won a monetary award and national publication in 1893 in a contest sponsored by the American
Humane Society
, and was reprinted several times commercially thereafter. Described in the introduction as a "Sequel to
Black Beauty
"', it tells the story of good and bad treatment of farm animals and local wildlife, especially songbirds, in the America Midwest. The novel is generally attributed as the first published work of the novelist
Gene Stratton Porter
, and bears a remarkable textual similarity to her other books.
One of the most popular of the interwar pony stories for children,
Moorland Mousie
(1929), by
'Golden Gorse'
(Muriel Wace), is heavily influenced by
Black Beauty
.
Phyllis Briggs wrote a sequel called
Son of Black Beauty
, published in 1950.
The Pullein-Thompson sisters wrote several stories concerning relatives of Black Beauty. They are "Black Ebony" (1975; by
Josephine
), "Black Velvet" (1975; by
Christine
), "Black Princess" (1975; by
Diana
), "Black Nightshade" (1978; by Josephine), "Black Romany" (1978; by Diana), "Blossom" (1978; by Christine), "Black Piper" (1982; by Diana), "Black Raven" (1982; by Josephine) and "Black Pioneer" (1982; by Christine). The book
Black Swift
(1991) by Josephine is not about a Black Beauty relative. These were published in several compilations as well as some of them being available separately. Each compilation was subsequently republished, sometimes with a change of name.
Spike Milligan
wrote a parody of the novel called
Black Beauty According to Spike Milligan
(1996).

Giovan Battista and Maria Cerutti.
Francesco Daverio
(April 3, 1815 in Varese - June 3, 1849 in Rome) was a patriot of the Italian unification, Chief of Staff of the
Roman Republic
, and an engineer, who died on the
Janiculum
defending the
Casino dei quattro venti
.
Daverio took part in the
Five Days of Milan
in March 1848. In August 1848, he was sent by
Giuseppe Mazzini
to guide
Giuseppe Garibaldi
in the campaign in Varese. He fought in
Luino
and
Morazzone
in 1848. In 1849 he fought in
Velletri
and defended the
Roman Republic.
Early years
[
edit
]
Daverio was born in Varese on April 3, 1815, to the farmer Giovan Battista, and his wife, Maria Cerutti.
[1]
He completed his pre-college studies in
Parabiago
and Varese.
In 1834, he entered
University of Pavia
and on January 4, 1839, he graduated with a degree in Engineering and Architecture. He worked as an engineer at the Ponti engineering studio in Varese and at the prestigious Gerli engineering studio in Milan. He also was the director and superintendent of the assets of the noble Della Sala family of Varese. He worked for
Ospedale Maggiore
in Milan, where he also participated in the
Five Days of Milan
.
[2]
With Garibaldi
[
edit
]
Daverio's first meeting with Garibaldi took place on August 13, 1848, at
Castelletto sopra Ticino
. Garibaldi, who had arrived in June or May via
Nice
and
Uruguay
, started the Provisional Government of Lombardy, gathering 1300 volunteers to begin an uprising in
Varese
.
Bust of Daverio
On August 9, 1848, Austria and Piedmont had signed the Salasco Armistice, which Garibaldi found unacceptable. Garibaldi was waiting for aid from Switzerland; Mazzini had promised him guns and 180 men. Only Daverio, the 33-year-old engineer from Varese, had arrived. Mazzini had sent him as a guide.
The small army marched during the night from Castelletto sopra Ticino to
Arona
. Garibaldi seized the steamboats
San Carlo
and
Verbano
in the port, which had been used by the postal service on the lake. They also seized nine other boats on the lake. They lade small pieces of artillery, 1,286 rations of bread and twenty bags of rice and landed in Luino at eight o'clock in the evening of August 14 with 800 men.
Lugano in the early 20th century
The campaign lasted fifteen days and, after the riots of Luino on August 15 and Morazzone on the 26th, revolution was in the air.  Of the 800 men who had gone with him, only seventy followed Garibaldi to
Switzerland
. Daverio proved invaluable in guiding the retreat of the forces through the
Campo dei Fiori
in
Brusimpiano
, past the shores of Lake Lugano, and out of the country.  With a long trip past
Buguggiate
,
Capolago
, Varese, Morosolo,
Casciago
,
Velate
, St. Ambrose, Bregazzana, the German Alps, and Borgnana Cavagna, the patrol arrived in the late evening of August 27 at Casamora, an isolated area between Brusimpiano and Porto.
A plaque is still visible from the road along the lake showing the house Garibaldi, exhausted from the long march, slept in. The next night, Brusimpianesi barges carried a troop thinned to about thirty volunteers, defying the Austrian gunboat patrols. Garibaldi went to Agno and then
Lugano
. Those who had lost him would eventually reach Switzerland in small groups. Garibaldi's volunteers were not yet ready to take Italy.
In Lugano, Daverio got in touch with his contacts from the uprising in
Lombardy
. After the riots started in the fall in
Val d'Intelvi
, he left Locarno on October 31 and landed in
Germignaga
, on the Lombardy side of
Lake Maggiore
, where it reaches
Luino
. He was greeted by the
giunta nazionale d’insurrezione.
Two Austrian columns rushed from Varese, the uprising failed, and Daverio retreated on the lake from which he came, this time destined for
Piedmont
.
[3]
The debris of the
Casino dei quattro venti
after the Siege of Rome
1849 and death
[
edit
]
In March 1849 he reappeared in
Velletri
. He died, defending Rome at the
Casino dei quattro venti
on June 3, 1849. Almost at the same time, another Varesini
Enrico Dandolo
died at the
Palazzo Corsini
. Another young patriot and Varese native,
Emilio Morosini
, would also die on the Janiculum in June 1849.
Legacy
[
edit
]
The Varese technical institute for surveyors is named after him. There are streets named after him in Rome,
[4]
Varese,
[5]
and Milan.

The
Bulgarian
name system
(
Bulgarian
: Българска именна система) has considerable similarities with most other
European
name systems, and with those of other
Slavic peoples
such as the
Russian
name system, although it has certain unique features.
Bulgarian names usually consist of a
given name
, which comes first, a
patronymic
, which is second (and is usually omitted when referring to the person), and a
family name
, which comes last.
Bulgarian given names
[
edit
]
Traditionally, the Bulgarian given names are either of
Slavic origin
or from
Greek
,
Latin
or
Hebrew
when reflecting
Christian
faith (e.g.
Petar
,
Maria
,
Ivan
,
Teodora
,
Georgi
,
Nikolay
,
Mihail
,
Paraskeva
,
Dimitar
).
The
Slavic names
may describe the appearance or character of the person, may constitute a wish or even stem from pre-Christian conjuring rituals that are meant not to attract the
evil spirits
. Below are listed examples of Bulgarian
Slavic names
and Bulgarian names of Greek, Latin, or Hebrew origin:

In addition, some Bulgarian names may be of
Thracian
(e.g. Neno, Dako, Boto, Geto) or
Bulgar
(Boris,
Boyan
, Biser) origin.
Since the
Bulgarian National Revival
and the
Liberation of Bulgaria
in 1878 names of successful
medieval Bulgarian rulers
, like
Asen
,
Asparuh
,
Ivaylo
,
Samuil
,
Simeon
or
Krum
, have also gained a lot of popularity.
Traditionally, the parents would often name their child after an older relative, so that his/her name would live on in the family. Today, however, these are not binding conditions and are often ignored: parents often pick a name without conforming with these traditions, however, still many of them continue to observe them. Traditions to name a child after the parents'
best man
or
maid of honor
or the saint on whose
name day
the child is born also exist.
Many Bulgarian given names have a diminutive and/or a shorter version, which is almost always used in an informal context. Following is an example of some common diminutives:

Bulgarian patronymics and family names
[
edit
]
Usage
[
edit
]
Typically, a Bulgarian person inherits the last name of his father's family (family name), as well as a patronymic based on his father's given name, with a gender-
agreeing
suffix
usually added. For example, Stoyan
Georgi
ev
Draganov
would be the son of
Georgi
Petkov
Draganov
. The same person's daughter would bear the names
Georgi
eva
Draganov
a
. Another way of preserving the family name and the name of a specific ancestor would be the following circulating of the names: if the father's name is Ivan Petrov Mihailov, the son is named Petar Ivanov Mihailov. Then if Petar has a son, his name will be Ivan Petrov Mihailov, and so on.
Until recently
[
when?
]
, if the father's name was not a specific family name, the child would take his patronymic as a family name, so names in a chain of generations would shift. For example, the son of Petar Stoyanov Ivanov would be Georgi Petrov Stoyanov, his son would be Ivaylo Georgiev Petrov, his son would be Marin Ivaylov Georgiev. This practice often caused confusion in the past, especially when dealing for foreign institutions, since a child did not bear his father's family name. However, the recent generation has all but abandoned this practice.

When marrying, today a woman may choose either to adopt her husband's family name, retain her
maiden name
or combine the two using a hyphen. For instance, when marrying Nikolay Petrov, Maria Bogdanova could become Petrova, remain Bogdanova or adopt Petrova-Bogdanova or Bogdanova-Petrova. Historically, she would adopt her husband's name. In any case, a woman retains her patronymic, which she has inherited from her father.
The Family Code (Bulgarian law regulating wedlock, cohabitation and family) allows the reverse as well: the husband may also take or add his wife's family name.
Sometimes a person is well known and referred to with his patronymic, e.g. sci-fi writer
Lyuben Dilov
's full name is Lyuben Dilov Ivanov, the Bulgarian
cosmonaut
Georgi Ivanov
's full name is Georgi Ivanov Kakalov, and footballer
Georgi Asparuhov
's full name is Georgi Asparuhov Rangelov.
Among
Bulgarians in Serbia
, as well as in other countries throughout the world, the
a
ending of women's surnames is usually dropped, resulting in names such as Elizabeta Nikolov instead of Nikolova. Other examples of changes in the family name of Bulgarians living abroad is how Nikolov turns into Nikoloff.
Etymology
[
edit
]
In most cases (though by no means always), the etymology of Bulgarian patronymics and family names closely corresponds to that of given names. Many families bear the name of the family's founder, adding the patronymic Slavic suffix "-ov/-ev" (men) or "-ova/-eva" (women) (e.g. Ivanov, Radeva, Parvanov, Petrova, Asenov, Tsvetanova). Family names may indicate the occupation of the founder, his nickname or origin, in which case names of
Ottoman Turkish
or Greek etymology can be found in addition to those of Slavic origin (e.g. Kolarov, Kalaydzhieva, Popova, Cholakov, Kovacheva, Daskalov, Tepavicharov, Uzunova).
Suffixes
[
edit
]
Most Bulgarian surnames end with "-ov(a)" or "-ev(a)". They work the same way as the
patronymic
(and are in fact derived from them), and are possessive forms of given names. The "-ov/-ev" (masculine) and "-ova/-eva" (feminine) suffixes are also extremely popular and commonly used by
Russians
and
Macedonians
. Consequently, the surnames Ivanov(a), Petrov(a) and Borisov(a) are the three most common surnames in Bulgaria. As these "-ov/-ev" surnames are indistinguishable from patronymics, it is not uncommon for people to have the same patronymic and surname; for instance the children of Petar Ivanov Petrov would be Georgi Petrov Petrov and Lyudmila Petrova Petrova. (This would also be distinguished from Russians, who would be named "Georgi Petrovich Petrov" and "Lyudmila Petrovna Petrova".)
Although most popular, "-ov/-ev" and respectively "-ova/-eva" are not the only patronymic and family name suffixes. The second most popular suffix is "-ski/-ska" (sometimes "-ki/-ka") (e.g. Zelenogorski, Stoykovska, Petrinska), which, besides often being merely a version of an "-ov/-ev" or "--ova/-eva" name, may also often indicate origin (e.g. Sofianski — "from
Sofia
", Stamboliyski — "from
Istanbul
"). This suffix is not only popular with Bulgarians but with most other Slavic people, such as
Polish
, Macedonians, Russians (most often spelled as "-sky"),
Belarusians
and
Ukrainians
.
Another suffix is "-in/-ina" (e.g. Kunin, Ganina, Radin). Unlike all other Bulgarian patronymics and family names, these stem from a female name (e.g. "of Kuna", "of Gana", "of Rada").
[

]
They are most common in the region of Razlog and Bansko. The "-in" suffix is also popular with Russians.
For these three most popular suffixes, there is also a plural form used when referring to the family as a whole or several members of it (as opposed to a single member). For "-ov/-ova" and "-ev/-eva" it is "-ovi/-evi", for "-ski/-ska" it is "-ski" and for "-in/-ina" the form is "-ini".
Historically, the universal suffix "-ovich" and "-evich" was quite popular in some regions (bearers of such names include
Gavril Krastevich
,
Hristofor Zhefarovich
,
Petar Parchevich
,
Kiril Peychinovich
, etc.), particularly among the Roman Catholic Bulgarians, but has today largely fallen out of use and is more typical for the
Serbo
-
Croatian
name system (where it is usually spelled "
-ić
").
In addition, other suffixes also exist: for instance, names like Tihanek, Kozlek, Lomek (suffixed "-ek") were historically dominant in the town of
Koprivshtitsa
.
[1]
(Internet Archive link)
Names lacking a suffix, although often foreign-sounding, have been more popular in the past, but still exist today (e.g. Beron, Tomash), despite being quite uncommon.

According to one study using

John Frederick Marsh
(11 May 1875 - 30 October 1927) was an English
cricketer
who played in eight
first-class cricket
matches for
Cambridge University
in 1904.
[1]
[2]
His unbeaten 172 in the second innings of the 1904
University Match
was the highest score in the fixture at the time. He was born at
Thame
,
Oxfordshire
and died at
Higham on the Hill
,
Leicestershire
.
Marsh was educated at
Amersham Hall
school and at
Jesus College, Cambridge
.
[3]
As a cricketer he was a right-handed opening batsman and he had made his debut for
Oxfordshire County Cricket Club
in minor matches in 1892, playing regularly in the county's
Minor Counties
matches from 1897.
[1]
He was described in his obituary in
Wisden Cricketers' Almanack
as "a batsman with a dogged defence and no pretensions to style".
[4]
He was 25 years old before he went to
Cambridge University
and played in the freshmen's trial match in 1901, scoring 98 in the second innings, but then failed to be selected for any games except trial matches at Cambridge for the next three seasons.
[5]
In 1904, however, having made a century in a trial match for the university side, Marsh finally made his first-class debut and in his third game, the match against the
London County Cricket Club
,
W. G. Grace
's team, he scored 118 in the second innings.
[6]
That led to his selection for the 1904
University Match
against
Oxford University
, where he proved to be a successful but controversial player. In the second Cambridge innings, Marsh made an unbeaten 172, the highest score in the history of the University Match, beating by one run the 171 made by
Tip Foster
in 1900.
[7]
The decision by Cambridge captain
Frederic Wilson
to delay the second innings declaration to enable Marsh to beat the record was widely criticised as the match then ended in a draw.
Wisden Cricketers' Almanack
wrote that the delay "was clearly a mistake" and that "the chance of winning the match should have outweighed all considerations of personal distinction", though it added that rain and missed catches had also contributed to Cambridge's failure to win.
[8]
Marsh played no further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge University in the summer of 1904, and his appearances for Oxfordshire tailed off by 1906. He became a schoolmaster at
Rossall School
- where he was joined fleetingly by his Cambridge cricket captain, Wilson, who soon left to become a sports journalist; Marsh remained at Rossall until 1915.

The
Academy of Fine Arts Vienna
(German:
Akademie der bildenden Künste Wien
) is a public art school in Vienna, Austria.
History
[
edit
]
The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna was founded in 1688 as a private academy modelled on the
Accademia di San Luca
and the Parisien
Académie de peinture et de sculpture
by the court-painter
Peter Strudel
, who became the
Praefectus Academiae Nostrae
. In 1701, he was ennobled by Emperor
Joseph I
as
Freiherr
(Baron) of the
Empire
. With his death in 1714, the academy temporarily closed.

On 20 January 1725, Emperor
Charles VI
appointed the Frenchman
Jacob van Schuppen
as Prefect and Director of the Academy, which was refounded as the
k.k. Hofakademie der Maler, Bildhauer und Baukunst
(Imperial and Royal Court Academy of painters, sculptors and architecture). Upon Charles's death in 1740, the academy at first declined, however during the rule of his daughter Empress
Maria Theresa
, a new statute reformed the academy in 1751. The prestige of the academy grew during the deanships of
Michelangelo Unterberger
and
Paul Troger
, and in 1767 the archduchesses
Maria Anna
and
Maria Carolina
were made the first Honorary Members. In 1772, there were further reforms to the organisational structure. In 1776, the engraver Jakob Matthias Schmutzer founded a school of engraving.  This Imperial-Royal Academy of Engraving in the Annagasse soon competed with the Court Academy.
Chancellor
Wenzel Anton Kaunitz
integrated all existing art academies into the
k.k. vereinigten Akademie der bildenden Künste
(Imperial and Royal Unified Academy of Fine Arts). The word "vereinigten" (unified) was later dropped. In 1822 the art cabinet grew significantly with the bequest of honorary member
Anton Franz de Paula Graf Lamberg-Sprinzenstein
. His collection still forms the backbone of the art on display.
[2]
Main entrance on Schillerplatz
In 1872, Emperor
Franz Joseph I of Austria
approved a statute making the academy the supreme government authority for the arts. A new building was constructed according to plans designed by
Theophil Hansen
in the course of the layout of the
Ringstraße
boulevard.
[3]
On 3 April 1877, the present-day building on Schillerplatz in the
Innere Stadt
district was inaugurated, the interior works, including ceiling frescos by
Anselm Feuerbach
, continued until 1892. In 1907 and 1908, young
Adolf Hitler
, who had come from
Linz
, was twice denied admission to the drawing class. He stayed in Vienna, subsisting on his orphan allowance, and tried unsuccessfully to continue his profession as an artist. Soon he had withdrawn into poverty and started selling amateur paintings, mostly
watercolours
, for meagre sustenance until he left Vienna for
Munich
in May 1913 (see also,
Paintings by Adolf Hitler
).

During the Austrian
Anschluss
to
Nazi Germany
from 1938-1945, the academy, like other Austrian universities, was forced to purge its staff and student body of Jews and others that fell under the purview of the
Nuremberg Racial Laws
.
[5]
After
World War II
, the academy was reconstituted in 1955 and its autonomy reconfirmed. Eduard von Josch, the secretary of the Academy, was dismissed for being a member of the NSDAP.
[5]
The academy has had
university
status since 1998, but retained its original name. It is currently the only Austrian university without the word "university" in its name.
Structure
[
edit
]
The academy is divided into the following institutes:
[6]
Institute for Fine Arts
, which houses thirteen departments: Abstract Painting; Art and Digital Media; Art and Photography; Arts and Research; Conceptual Art; Contextual Painting; Expanded Pictorial Space; Figurative Painting; Graphic Arts and Printmaking Techniques; Object Sculpture; Performative Art - Sculpture; Video and Video-installation; Textual Sculpture
[7]
Institute for Art Theory and Cultural Studies
(art theory, philosophy, history);
Institute for Conservation and Restoration
;
Institute for Natural Sciences and Technologies in Art
;
Institute for Secondary School Teaching Degrees
(craft, design, textile arts);
Institute for Art and Architecture
.
The Academy currently has about 900 students, almost a quarter of which are foreign students. Its faculty includes "stars" such as
Peter Sloterdijk
. Its library houses about 110,000 volumes and its "etching cabinet" (
Kupferstichkabinett
) has about 150,000 drawings and prints. The collection is one of the biggest in Austria, and is used for academic purposes, although portions are also open to the general public.

Adolf Hitler
- Austrian-born German dictator (1889-1945)
In fiction
[
edit
]
The Academy of Fine Arts in 1908 is the scene of the early chapters of the 2001
Alternative History
novel
The Alternative Hypothesis
("
La part de l'autre
") by
Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt
. It is based on the assumption that had the young
Adolf Hitler
been accepted he might have become a recognized painter and never entered politics, and never become the dictator of
Nazi Germany
. The dramatic tension in the book's plot develops from the Academy staff, deliberating whether or not to admit Hitler, thinking of it as an unimportant matter concerning a single unknown student - while the readers are aware that in fact they are deciding the future of the entire world.

Layer of dolerite rock in northern England
The Whin Sill at
Crag Lough
, showing
Hadrian's Wall
running along the top.
The
Whin Sill
or
Great Whin Sill
is a tabular layer of the
igneous
rock
dolerite
in
County Durham
,
Northumberland
and
Cumbria
in the northeast of
England
. It lies partly in the
North Pennines
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
and partly in
Northumberland National Park
and stretches from
Teesdale
northwards towards
Berwick
.
It is one of the key natural features of the
North Pennines
. A major outcrop is at the
High Force
waterfall in
Teesdale
.
Bamburgh Castle
,
Dunstanburgh Castle
,
Lindisfarne Castle
and stretches of
Hadrian's Wall
all strategically take advantage of high, rocky cliff lines formed by the sill.
The Whin Sill complex is usually divided into three components:
Holy Island Sill
,
Alnwick Sill
and the
Hadrian's Wall-Pennines Sill
, which were created by separate
magma
flows, but at about the same time.
[1]
The
Little Whin Sill
is an associated formation to the south, in
Weardale
.
Derivation of name
[
edit
]
Much of the early study of geology began in the British Isles, whence much of the terminology is derived. Quarrymen of Northern England used the term 'sill' to describe a more or less horizontal body of rock.  'Whin' was applied to dark, hard rocks.  As the intrusive igneous origin of the Whin Sill was determined in the 19th century, the term '
sill
' was adopted by geologists for concordant, tabular intrusive bodies.
[2]
Geology
[
edit
]
Towards the close of
Carboniferous Period
and in the early
Permian
, some 295 million years ago (Ma),
crustal
extension caused by movement of the Earth's
tectonic plates
during the
Variscan orogeny
allowed the emplacement of
igneous intrusions
of
magma
across much of northern England of a suite of
tholeiitic
dolerite
intrusions
.
[3]
These were largely concordant with the
strata
of the existing
country rock
. On cooling, these crystallised and solidified to form the Great Whin Sill. It is dated at around 301- 294 million years old, thus spanning the Carboniferous/Permian boundary at 299 Ma.
[4]
It underlies much of south and east Northumberland and the
Durham Coalfield
.  Its maximum known thickness of around 70 metres occurs in the North Pennines.
Surface and subsurface records of the Great Whin reveal it is not always concordant over wide areas and often rises and falls in the stratigraphical succession in marked leaps and gentle transgressions different levels.
Studies of the
petrology
of the dolerites of the Whin Sill complex have revealed significant differences between the
Little Whin Sill
and the
Great Whin Sill
. The Little Whin Sill is
olivine
-bearing and believed to be composed of an early
differentiate
of the Whin dolerite magma. On the other hand, the Great Whin, non-olivine-bearing and slightly density graded, is a later differentiate of the Whin magma.
Two separate periods of Whin dolerite injection are confirmed by studies of
vitrinite
reflectance over the
Alston Block
where two periods of Whin
contact metamorphism
have been recognized. The two periods of Whin dolerite emplacement form part of the end-Carboniferous earth movements in northern England. They can be shown to have occurred between a period of compression from a W-SW direction and later gentle doming of the Alston Block near the Westphalian-Stephanian boundary, dated about 300-295 Ma.
The
lithology
is notable in many respects, including well developed
pegmatite
segregations which can be found in Upper Teesdale.  Late stage
hydrothermal
mineralisation has filled the joints with
pectolite
.  The dolerite has been carbonated as
metasomatic
selvages into veins and joints and other flaws to produce 'White Whin'.
Thermal metamorphism
of the country rock in the contact zone produced coarse grained
marbles
within the
contact aureole
in a small number of places in Teesdale.
Disused roadstone
quarries
along the course of the sill offer sections for its interpretation.
Effects on landscape and geography
[
edit
]
The
regolith
supports alpine/Arctic flora which includes spring gentian (
Gentiana verna
), bird's-eye primrose (
Primula farinosa
), mountain avens (
Dryas octopetala
) and Teesdale violet (
Viola rupestris
). This is an example of the intimate interaction and dependence of geology and ecology.
The resistance to
erosion
of the dolerite gives rise to a number of striking
geomorphological
features such as
High Force
,
Low Force
,
Cauldron Snout
,
High Cup Nick
,
Scordale
and Holwick Scars.

Love Is the Song We Sing: San Francisco Nuggets 1965-1970
is the fourth
Nuggets
box set released by
Rhino Records
. It was released in 2007 and packaged as an 8 1/2 x 11" 120 page hardcover book, the first 73 pages of which were made up mostly of vintage photographs. The compilation focuses on
San Francisco Sound
bands. Its title is derived from the first line of "
Get Together
," two versions of which open (
Dino Valenti
) and close (
The Youngbloods
) the four-disc set. Although the liner notes cite the 1965 Rag Baby EP as the source for the Country Joe & the Fish track "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag", it was actually taken from the 1967 LP I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die.

Bantry House
is a historic house with gardens in
Bantry
,
County Cork
,
Ireland
. Originally built in the early 18th century, it has been owned and occupied by the White family (formerly
Earls of Bantry
) since the mid-18th century. Opened to the public since the 1940s, the house, estate and gardens are a tourist destination in
West Cork
.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Bantry House (originally called 'Blackrock')
[3]
was constructed in about 1710 on the South side of
Bantry Bay
.
[1]
In 1750, Councillor Richard White bought Blackrock from Samuel Hutchinson and changed the name to 'Seafield'.
[3]
The Whites had settled on
Whiddy Island
across the Bay in the late 17th century, after having originally been merchants in
Limerick
. The family prospered and considerable purchases of land were made in the area surrounding the house. By the 1780s, Bantry House comprised approximately 80,000 acres (320 km
2
), though much of this would not be arable.
[

The house has been open to tourism since 1946.
[2]
Gardens
[
edit
]
The house and gardens in 1895. The conservatory no longer exists.
The gardens to Bantry House were developed by
Richard White, 2nd Earl of Bantry
and his wife Mary. The gardens contain seven terraces; the house is located on the third. One hundred steps are located behind the house and fountain, and are surrounded by azaleas and rhododendron.
[4]
By 1997 the grounds of Bantry House were suffering from neglect in certain places. A European grant was obtained to start the restoration process. Funding ceased in 2000. The restoration work is still ongoing.

French expedition to Ireland (1796)
An exhibition on the role Bantry House played in the
United Irishmen Rebellion
was opened in the courtyard of the house ahead of the rebellion's bi-centenary.
[5]
[6]
The exhibition was designed to cover the
French expedition to Ireland in 1796
, and the role of
Richard White
, then owner of the house and later 1st Earl of Bantry, in opposing the attempted landings. Ultimately the French armada never landed, as severe weather resulted in the loss of several ships - including the frigate
Surveillante
.
[7]
The Armada Centre contained a scale model of the
Surveillante
and several artifacts recovered from its wreck.

Tourism Education Press
(
TEP
) is a
university press
affiliated to
Beijing International Studies University
(BISU) of
China
.
[1]
It was founded in November 1987 as part of the national initiative to promote the domestic tourism industry and tourism education.
History
[
edit
]
The history of the press dates back to the 1980s, during which the strong links of the university to the Chinese tourism ministry
CNTA
significantly contributed to the establishment of TEP.
In 1978, the Chinese government introduced the
economic reform
and put great emphasis on the integration into the global market. In order to improve the English proficiency of the service personnel, especially in terms of the tourism industry, for three consecutive years, the CNTA consigned the language training responsibility to Beijing International Studies University and in 1981, the Department of Tourism was jointly established by the university and CNTA.
In March 1983, the university became directly affiliated to the Ministry and clearly positioned itself as a tertiary institution for tourism education, specialised in tourism
translation and interpreting
,
tourism trade
and
tourism management
. In 1987, the then Chairman of the CNTA Han Kehua took up the post of the university president. In the same year, the Tourism Education Press was established in November, and because of the university's direct affiliation to the CNTA, the press was also recognised as a
national
or
central
publishing house.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
English oboist
Blue plaque, 70 Edith Road West Kensington, London
Léon Jean Goossens
,
CBE
,
FRCM
(12 June 1897 - 13 February 1988) was an English
oboist
.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
Goossens was born in
Liverpool
,
Lancashire
, and studied at
Liverpool College of Music
[2]
and the
Royal College of Music
. His father was
violinist
and
conductor
Eugène Goossens
, his brother the
conductor
and composer
Eugene Aynsley Goossens
and his sisters the
harpists
Marie
and
Sidonie Goossens
.
[3]
In 1916 his brother
Adolphe
, a gifted
French horn
player, was killed in action at the
Somme
.
[4]
During the early and middle parts of the 20th century, he was considered among the premier oboists in the world. He joined the
Queen's Hall
Orchestra (conducted by
Henry Wood
) at the age of 15 and was later (1932) engaged by Sir
Thomas Beecham
for the newly founded
London Philharmonic Orchestra
, but he also enjoyed a rich solo and
chamber-music
career. He became famous for a uniquely pleasing sound few other oboists could match.
[1]
Oboists of the past had tended to be divided between the French school (elegant but thin and reedy in tone) and the German (full and rounded but rather clumsy, with little or no
vibrato
), but Goossens brought together the best qualities of both styles.
[3]
Goossens commissioned a number of works for the oboe from such distinguished composers as Sir
Edward Elgar
,
Ralph Vaughan Williams
and
Rutland Boughton
and collaborated extensively with other prominent soloists such as
Yehudi Menuhin
. Amongst his many pupils were the oboists
Evelyn Barbirolli
,
Joy Boughton
, daughter of Rutland Boughton and
Peter Graeme
, oboist of the
Melos Ensemble
.
[5]
He was appointed a Commander of the
Order of the British Empire
(CBE) in 1950 and made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1962.  He married his second wife Lucie Leslie Burrowes in 1933 and there were three daughters: Benedicta, Jennie (an actress) and Corinne.

"
Listen to Your Heart
" is a song by Swedish rock duo
Roxette
, which was originally released in Sweden in September 1988 as the second single from the duo's second
studio album
,
Look Sharp!
(1988). It was written by
Per Gessle
with former
Gyllene Tider
guitarist Mats "M.P." Persson. The song went on to become one of the most successful singles of 1989, reaching number one in both the United States and Canada around November 1989.
[2]
The track was the first song to reach number one in the US without a commercially released
7-inch single
.
[3]
"Listen to Your Heart" originally peaked at number 62 in the UK when it was released there in October 1989. However, following the success of "
It Must Have Been Love
", the track was reissued as a
double A-side
with "
Dangerous
" in August 1990, upon which it reached a chart peak of number six on the
UK Singles Chart
. In 2005,
Belgian
trance act
DHT
released a remixed version of the song, which became a top 10 hit in numerous territories, including France, the Netherlands, the UK and the US.
Composition and style
[
edit
]
Per Gessle
described "Listen to Your Heart" in the
liner notes
of Roxette's 1995
greatest hits
compilation
Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!
as "The Big Bad Ballad. This is us trying to recreate that overblown American FM-rock sound to the point where it almost becomes absurd. We really wanted to see how far we could take it."
[4]
Its lyrics were inspired by a close friend of Gessle's, who was in "emotional turmoil, stuck between an old relationship and a new love. A year later, I call him up in the middle of the night after a few too many glasses of champagne, saying 'Hey, you're number one in the States.'"
[1]
According to
Ultimate Guitar
, the track is an
alternative rock
ballad
, with a moderately slow tempo of 86
beats per minute
. The
verses
are made up of three repeating sequences of
Bm
[5]
-G-A and one additional sequence of Bm-G-Em. The first two
choruses
are composed of two repetitions of a Bm-G-D-A sequence, followed by an extended sequence of D-A-G-D-Bm-G-A-Bm. The
bridge
consists of E-
C♯m
-B-A-B-C♯. The final chorus has been modified up by two full tones it consists of two repetitions of D♯m-B-F♯-C♯, followed by a sequence of F♯-C♯-B-F♯-D♯m-B-C♯-D♯m-B, with the final four notes being repeated for the
outro
.
[6]
Seven different versions of the song were released: the original album version; the "Swedish Single Edit", a slightly edited version included on subsequent greatest hits compilations; the "US Remix", used in the music video; the "AC Mix", which is similar to the 'US remix' but with the guitar in the bridge replaced by a
saxophone
; shorter edits of the aforementioned 2 versions, which cut some parts from the last refrain; and the 7-inch single version, which fades out shortly after the last refrain, omitting most of the outro.
[7]
Critical reception
[
edit
]
In his review of the
Look Sharp!
album, Bryan Buss from
AllMusic
felt the song is "bland" and "overproduced".
[8]
Pan-European magazine
Music & Media
commented, "Already doing well in the US, this semi-
ballad
has all the ingredients of a major worldwide hit. This time it seems that the Swedes have beaten the Americans at their own game."
[9]
In 1990, David Giles from
Music Week
called it "another big hit", adding that "this single is anything to go by — it made history by reaching number one despite being available on cassette only."
[10]
Music video
[
edit
]
Doug Freel directed the song's
music video
, which was filmed during a live performance at the
Borgholm Castle
ruin on the Swedish
Baltic Sea
island of
Öland
.
[11]
Freel and the video's production crew believed the ruin to have been created especially for the video. Gessle said: "It took some time to convince them that the place actually was for real."
[4]
The song has been performed on all of Roxette's concert tours. On the
Look Sharp!
Live Tour and
Join the Joyride! Tour
, it was performed in its original, power ballad style, although it has been performed in an acoustic version on all tours since the
Crash! Boom! Bang!
Tour
in 1994.

Homo sapiens
population density (2005)
Humans
, or
modern humans
(
Homo sapiens
), are the most common and widespread
species
of
primate
. A
great ape
characterized by their
hairlessness
,
bipedalism
, and high
intelligence
, humans have large
brains
, enabling more advanced
cognitive
skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex
tools
, and form complex
social structures
and
civilizations
. Humans are
highly social
, with a single human tending to belong to a
multi-layered
network of cooperating, distinct, or even competing
social groups
- from
families
and
peer groups
to
corporations
and
political states
. As such,
social interactions
between humans have established a wide variety of values,
social norms
,
languages
, and
traditions
(collectively termed
institutions
), each of which bolsters human
society
. Humans are also highly
curious
: the desire to understand and influence
phenomena
has motivated humanity's development of
science
,
technology
,
philosophy
,
mythology
,
religion
, and other frameworks of
knowledge
; humans also study themselves through such domains as
anthropology
,
social science
,
history
,
psychology
, and
medicine
.
Although some scientists equate the term "humans" with all members of the genus
Homo
, in common usage it generally refers to
Homo sapiens
, the only
extant
member. Other members of the genus
Homo
are known posthumously as
archaic humans
.
Anatomically modern humans
emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from
Homo heidelbergensis
or a similar species. Migrating
out of Africa
, they gradually replaced and
interbred
with local populations of archaic humans. For most of their history, humans were
nomadic
hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting
behavioral modernity
about 160,000-60,000 years ago. The
Neolithic Revolution
, which began in
Southwest Asia
around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of
agriculture
and permanent
human settlement
; in turn, this led to the
development of civilization
and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing)
population growth
and rapid
technological change
. Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of
sociocultural
and
technological
developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle.
Genes
and the
environment
influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are
sexually dimorphic
: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher
body fat
percentage. At
puberty
, humans develop
secondary sex characteristics
. Females are capable of
pregnancy
, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and
menopause
, around the age of 50.
Humans are
omnivorous
, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have
used fire
and other forms of heat to prepare and
cook
food since the time of
Homo erectus
. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water. Humans are generally
diurnal
, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day.
Childbirth
is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are
helpless at birth
.
Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex
prefrontal cortex
, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent and capable of
episodic memory
; they have flexible facial expressions,
self-awareness
, and a
theory of mind
. The human mind is capable of
introspection
, private
thought
,
imagination
,
volition
, and forming views on
existence
. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development through complex
reasoning
and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations.
Language
,
art
, and
trade
are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.
Etymology and definition

Names for the human species
and
Human taxonomy
Carl Linnaeus
coined the name
Homo sapiens
and is the type specimen of the species
All modern humans are classified into the
species
Homo sapiens
, coined by
Carl Linnaeus
in his 1735 work
Systema Naturae
.
[2]
The
generic name
"
Homo
" is a learned 18th-century derivation from Latin
homō
, which refers to humans of either sex.
[3]
[4]
The word
human
can refer to all members of the
Homo
genus,
[5]
although in common usage it generally just refers to
Homo sapiens,
the only extant species.
[6]
The name "
Homo
sapiens
" means 'wise man' or 'knowledgeable man'.
[7]
There is disagreement if certain extinct members of the genus, namely
Neanderthals
, should be included as a separate species of humans or as a
subspecies
of
H. sapiens
.
[5]
Human
is a
loanword
of
Middle English
from
Old French
humain
, ultimately from
Latin
hūmānus
, the adjectival form of
homō
('man' - in the sense of humankind).
[8]
The native English term
man
can refer to the species generally (a synonym for
humanity
) as well as to human males. It may also refer to individuals of either sex.
[9]
Despite the fact that the word
animal
is colloquially used as an
antonym
for
human
,
[10]
and contrary to a
common biological misconception
, humans are animals.
[11]
The word
person
is often used interchangeably with
human
, but philosophical debate exists as to whether
personhood
applies to all humans or all
sentient beings
, and further if one can lose personhood (such as by going into a
persistent vegetative state
).

Humans are apes (
superfamily Hominoidea
).
[13]
The
lineage
of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from
gibbons
(family Hylobatidae) and
orangutans
(genus
Pongo
), then
gorillas
(genus
Gorilla
), and finally,
chimpanzees
and
bonobos
(genus
Pan
). The last split, between the human and chimpanzee-bonobo lineages, took place around 8-4 million years ago, in the late
Miocene
epoch.
[14]
[15]
During this split,
chromosome 2
was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.
[16]
Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, the
hominins
diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages - representing the genus
Homo
and its sole extant species
Homo sapiens
- are now extinct.
[17]
Reconstruction of
Lucy
,
the first
Australopithecus afarensis
skeleton found
The genus
Homo
evolved from
Australopithecus
.
[18]
[19]
Though
fossils
from the transition are scarce, the earliest members of
Homo
share several key traits with
Australopithecus
.
[20]
[21]
The earliest record of
Homo
is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen
LD 350-1
from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species are
Homo habilis
and
Homo rudolfensis
which evolved by 2.3 million years ago.
[21]
H. erectus
(the African variant is sometimes called
H. ergaster
) evolved 2 million years ago and was the first
archaic human
species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia.
[22]
H. erectus
also was the first to evolve a characteristically human
body plan
.
Homo sapiens
emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from a species commonly designated as either
H. heidelbergensis
or
H. rhodesiensis
, the descendants of
H. erectus
that remained in Africa.
[23]
H. sapiens
migrated out of the continent, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.
[24]
[25]
[26]
Humans began exhibiting
behavioral modernity
about 160,000-70,000 years ago,
[27]
and possibly earlier.
[28]
The
"out of Africa" migration
took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (
Southern Dispersal
) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.
[29]
[30]
H. sapiens
proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in
Eurasia
125,000 years ago,
[31]
[32]
Australia around 65,000 years ago,
[33]
the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as
Hawaii
,
Easter Island
,
Madagascar
, and
New Zealand
in the years 300 to 1280 CE.
[34]
[35]
Human evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved
interbreeding between related species
.
[36]
[37]
[38]
Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution.
[39]
DNA
evidence suggests that several genes of
Neanderthal
origin are present among all non sub-Saharan-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as
Denisovans
, may have contributed up to 6% of their
genome
to present-day non sub-Saharan-African humans.
[36]
[40]
[41]
Human evolution is characterized by a number of
morphological
,
developmental
,
physiological
, and
behavioral
changes that have taken place since the split between the
last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees
. The most significant of these adaptations are
hairlessness
,
[42]
obligate bipedalism, increased brain size and decreased
sexual dimorphism
(
neoteny
). The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.

Prehistory
Overview map of the peopling of the world by
early human migration
during the
Upper Paleolithic
, following to the
Southern Dispersal
paradigm
Until about 12,000 years ago, all humans lived as
hunter-gatherers
.
[44]
[45]
The
Neolithic Revolution
(the invention of
agriculture
) first took place in
Southwest Asia
and spread through large parts of the
Old World
over the following millennia.
[46]
It also occurred independently in
Mesoamerica
(about 6,000 years ago),
[47]
China,
[48]
[49]
Papua New Guinea
,
[50]
and the
Sahel
and
West Savanna
regions of Africa.
[51]
[52]
[53]
Access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent
human settlements
, the
domestication
of animals and the
use of metal tools
for the first time in history. Agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early
civilizations
.
[54]
[55]

Ancient
Main article:
Ancient history
Great Pyramids of Giza
,
Egypt
An
urban revolution
took place in the
4th millennium BCE
with the development of
city-states
, particularly
Sumerian
cities located in
Mesopotamia
.
[57]
It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing,
cuneiform script
, appeared around 3000 BCE.
[58]
Other major civilizations to develop around this time were
Ancient Egypt
and the
Indus Valley Civilisation
.
[59]
They eventually traded with each other and invented technology such as wheels, plows and sails.
[60]
[61]
[62]
[63]
Astronomy and mathematics were also developed and the
Great Pyramid of Giza
was built.
[64]
[65]
[66]
There is evidence of a
severe drought
lasting about a hundred years that may have caused the decline of these civilizations,
[67]
with new ones appearing in the aftermath.
Babylonians
came to dominate Mesopotamia while others,
[68]
such as the
Poverty Point culture
,
Minoans
and the
Shang dynasty
, rose to prominence in new areas.
[69]
[70]
[71]
The
Late Bronze Age collapse
around 1200 BCE resulted in the disappearance of a number of civilizations and the beginning of the
Greek Dark Ages
.
[72]
[73]
During this period iron started replacing bronze, leading to the
Iron Age
.
[74]
In the 5th century BCE, history started being
recorded as a discipline
, which provided a much clearer picture of life at the time.
[75]
Between the 8th and 6th century BCE, Europe entered the
classical antiquity
age, a period when
ancient Greece
and
ancient Rome
flourished.
[76]
[77]
Around this time other civilizations also came to prominence. The
Maya civilization
started to build cities and create
complex calendars
.
[78]
[79]
In Africa, the
Kingdom of Aksum
overtook the declining
Kingdom of Kush
and facilitated trade between India and the Mediterranean.
[80]
In West Asia, the
Achaemenid Empire
's system of centralized governance became the precursor to many later empires,
[81]
while the
Gupta Empire
in India and the
Han dynasty
in China have been described as
golden ages
in their respective regions.

Following the
fall of the Western Roman Empire
in 476, Europe entered the
Middle Ages
.
[84]
During this period,
Christianity
and the
Church
would provide centralized authority and education.
[85]
In the Middle East,
Islam
became the prominent religion and expanded into North Africa. It led to an
Islamic Golden Age
, inspiring achievements in
architecture
, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.
[86]
[87]
The
Christian
and
Islamic worlds
would eventually clash, with the
Kingdom of England
, the
Kingdom of France
and the
Holy Roman Empire
declaring a series of
holy wars
to regain control of the
Holy Land
from
Muslims
.
[88]
In the Americas, complex
Mississippian societies
would arise starting around 800 CE,
[89]
while further south, the
Aztecs
and
Incas
would become the dominant powers.
[90]
The
Mongol Empire
would conquer much of
Eurasia
in the 13th and 14th centuries.
[91]
Over this same time period, the
Mali Empire
in Africa grew to be the largest empire on the continent, stretching from
Senegambia
to
Ivory Coast
.
[92]
Oceania would see the rise of the
Tuʻi Tonga Empire
which expanded across many islands in the South Pacific.

Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to
water
and - depending on the lifestyle - other
natural resources
used for
subsistence
, such as populations of animal prey for
hunting
and
arable land
for growing crops and grazing livestock.
[119]
Modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their
habitats
by means of technology,
irrigation
,
urban planning
, construction,
deforestation
and
desertification
.
[120]
Human settlements
continue to be
vulnerable
to
natural disasters
, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction.
[121]
Grouping and deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of providing protection, accumulating comforts or material wealth, expanding the available food, improving
aesthetics
, increasing knowledge or enhancing the exchange of resources.
[122]
Humans are one of the most
adaptable
species, despite having a low or narrow tolerance for many of the earth's extreme environments.
[123]
Through advanced tools, humans have been able to extend their tolerance to a wide variety of temperatures,
humidity
, and altitudes.
[123]
As a result, humans are a
cosmopolitan
species found in almost all regions of the world, including
tropical rainforest
,
arid desert
, extremely cold
arctic regions
, and heavily polluted cities; in comparison, most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability.
[124]
The
human population
is not, however, uniformly distributed on the
Earth
's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another, and large stretches of surface are almost completely uninhabited, like
Antarctica
and vast swathes of the ocean.
[123]
[125]
Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).
[126]
Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the
deep sea
, and
outer space
.
[127]
Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to
scientific
,
military
, or
industrial
expeditions.
[127]
Humans have briefly visited the
Moon
and made their presence felt on other
celestial bodies
through human-made
robotic spacecraft
.
[128]
[129]
[130]
Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through
research stations
and, since 2000,
in space
through habitation on the
International Space Station
.
[131]
Humans and their domesticated animals represent 96% of all mammalian biomass on earth, whereas all wild mammals represent only 4%.
[132]
Estimates of the population at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.
[133]
[134]
Around 50-60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western
Roman Empire
in the 4th century AD.
[135]
Bubonic plagues
, first recorded in the 6th century AD, reduced the population by 50%, with the
Black Death
killing 75-200 million people in
Eurasia
and
North Africa
alone.
[136]
Human population is believed to have reached one billion in 1800. It has since then increased exponentially, reaching two billion in 1930 and three billion in 1960, four in 1975, five in 1987 and six billion in 1999.
[137]
It passed seven billion in 2011
[138]
and passed eight billion in November 2022.
[139]
It took over two million years of
human prehistory
and
history
for the human population to reach one
billion
and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion.
[140]
The combined
biomass
of the carbon of all the humans on Earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.
[132]
In 2018, 4.2 billion humans (55%) lived in urban areas, up from 751 million in 1950.
[141]
The most urbanized regions are Northern America (82%), Latin America (81%), Europe (74%) and Oceania (68%), with Africa and Asia having nearly 90% of the world's 3.4 billion rural population.
[141]
Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime,
[142]
especially in inner city and suburban
slums
. Humans have had a dramatic
effect on the environment
. They are
apex predators
, being rarely preyed upon by other species.
[143]
Human
population growth
, industrialization, land development,
overconsumption
and combustion of
fossil fuels
have led to
environmental destruction
and
pollution
that significantly contributes to the ongoing
mass extinction
of other forms of life.

Biology
Anatomy and physiology
Main article:
Human body
Basic anatomical features of female and male humans. These models have had
body hair
and male
facial hair
removed and head hair trimmed. The female model is wearing red
nail polish
on her
toenails
and a ring on her left hand.
Most aspects of human physiology are closely
homologous
to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The human body consists of the
legs
, the
torso
, the arms, the
neck
, and the head. An adult human body consists of about 100 trillion (10
14
)
cells
. The most commonly defined
body systems
in humans are the
nervous
, the
cardiovascular
, the
digestive
, the
endocrine
, the
immune
, the
integumentary
, the
lymphatic
, the
musculoskeletal
, the
reproductive
, the
respiratory
, and the
urinary system
.
[146]
[147]
The
dental formula
of humans is:
2.1.2.3
2.1.2.3
. Humans have proportionately shorter
palates
and much smaller
teeth
than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush
canine teeth
. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their
third molars
, with some individuals having them congenitally absent.
[148]
Humans share with chimpanzees a
vestigial
tail,
appendix
, flexible shoulder joints, grasping fingers and
opposable thumbs
.
[149]
Apart from bipedalism and brain size, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in
smelling
,
hearing
and
digesting proteins
.
[150]
While humans have a density of
hair follicles
comparable to other apes, it is predominantly
vellus hair
, most of which is so short and wispy as to be practically invisible.
[151]
[152]
Humans have about 2 million
sweat glands
spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.
[153]
It is estimated that the worldwide average
height for an adult human
male is about 171 cm (5 ft 7 in), while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 159 cm (5 ft 3 in).
[154]
Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be typical in the extremely
aged
.
[155]
Throughout history, human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.
[156]
The average
mass
of an adult human is 59 kg (130 lb) for females and 77 kg (170 lb) for males.
[157]
[158]
Like many other conditions, body weight and body type are influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.
[159]
[160]
Humans have a far faster and more accurate
throw
than other animals.
[161]
Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances.
[162]
[150]
Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid
heat exhaustion
while running for long distances.

, including both the female (XX) and male (XY) sex chromosomes (bottom right), as well as the
mitochondrial genome
(shown to scale as "MT" at bottom left).
Further information:
Karyotype
Like most animals, humans are a
diploid
and
eukaryotic
species. Each
somatic cell
has two sets of 23
chromosomes
, each set received from one parent;
gametes
have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 pairs of chromosomes, there are 22 pairs of
autosomes
and one pair of
sex chromosomes
. Like other mammals, humans have an
XY sex-determination system
, so that females have the sex chromosomes XX and males have XY.
[164]
Genes
and
environment
influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility and mental abilities. The exact influence of
genes and environment
on certain traits is not well understood.
[165]
[166]
While no humans - not even
monozygotic twins
- are genetically identical,
[167]
two humans on average will have a genetic similarity of 99.5%-99.9%.
[168]
[169]
This makes them more
homogeneous
than other great apes, including chimpanzees.
[170]
[171]
This small variation in human DNA compared to many other species suggests a
population bottleneck
during the
Late Pleistocene
(around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs.
[172]
[173]
The forces of
natural selection
have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the
genome
display
directional selection
in the past 15,000 years.
[174]
The
human genome
was first sequenced in 2001
[175]
and by 2020 hundreds of thousands of genomes had been sequenced.
[176]
In 2012 the
International HapMap Project
had compared the genomes of 1,184 individuals from 11 populations and identified 1.6 million
single nucleotide polymorphisms
.
[177]
African populations harbor the highest number of private genetic variants. While many of the common variants found in populations outside of Africa are also found on the African continent, there are still large numbers that are private to these regions, especially
Oceania
and
the Americas
.
[178]
By 2010 estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes.
[179]
By comparing
mitochondrial DNA
, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose
genetic marker
is found in all modern humans, the so-called
mitochondrial Eve
, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.

Most
human reproduction
takes place by
internal fertilization
via
sexual intercourse
, but can also occur through
assisted reproductive technology
procedures.
[184]
The average
gestation
period is 38 weeks, but a normal pregnancy can vary by up to 37 days.
[185]
Embryonic development in the human covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a
fetus
.
[186]
Humans are able to
induce early labor
or perform a
caesarean section
if the child needs to be born earlier for medical reasons.
[187]
In developed countries,
infants
are typically 3-4 kg (7-9 lb) in weight and 47-53 cm (19-21 in) in height at birth.
[188]
[189]
However,
low birth weight
is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of
infant mortality
in these regions.
[190]
Compared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous, with a much higher risk of complications and death.
[191]
The size of the fetus's head is more closely matched to the
pelvis
than other primates.
[192]
The reason for this is not completely understood,
[n 3]
but it contributes to a painful labor that can last 24 hours or more.
[194]
The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and
natural childbirth
remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with
maternal death rates
approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.
[195]
Both the mother and the father provide care for human offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly done by the mother.
[196]
Helpless at birth
, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching
sexual maturity
at 15 to 17 years of age.
[197]
[198]
[199]
The human life span has been split into various stages ranging from three to twelve. Common stages include
infancy
,
childhood
,
adolescence
,
adulthood
and
old age
.
[200]
The lengths of these stages have varied across cultures and time periods but is typified by an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence.
[201]
Human females undergo
menopause
and become
infertile
at around the age of 50.
[202]
It has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the
grandmother hypothesis
), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.
[203]
[204]
The life span of an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.
[205]
For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men.
[206]
As of 2018
, the global average
life expectancy at birth
of a girl is estimated to be 74.9 years compared to 70.4 for a boy.
[207]
[208]
There are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development - for example, life expectancy at birth in
Hong Kong
is 87.6 years for girls and 81.8 for boys, while in the
Central African Republic
, it is 55.0 years for girls and 50.6 for boys.
[209]
[210]
The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. In the
developing world
, the median age is between 15 and 20 years. While one in five Europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60 years of age or older.
[211]
In 2012, the United Nations estimated that there were 316,600 living
centenarians
(humans of age 100 or older) worldwide.

Diet
Main article:
Human nutrition
Humans living in
Bali
,
Indonesia
, preparing a meal
Humans are
omnivorous
, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material.
[213]
[214]
Human groups have adopted a range of diets from purely
vegan
to primarily
carnivorous
. In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to
deficiency diseases
; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources.
[215]
The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture and has led to the development of
food science
.
[216]
Until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago,
Homo sapiens
employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection.
[216]
This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with
wild game
, which must be hunted and captured in order to be consumed.
[217]
It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and
cook
food since the time of
Homo erectus
.
[218]
Around ten thousand years ago,
humans developed agriculture
,
[219]
[220]
[221]
which substantially altered their diet. This change in diet may also have altered human biology; with the spread of
dairy farming
providing a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest
lactose
in some adults.
[222]
[223]
The types of food consumed, and how they are prepared, have varied widely by time, location, and culture.
[224]
[225]
In general, humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat.
[226]
Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days, with a maximum of one week.
[227]
In 2020 it is estimated 9 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to
starvation
.
[228]
[229]
Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the
global burden of disease
.
[230]
However, global food distribution is not even, and
obesity
among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some
developed
and a few
developing countries
. Worldwide, over one billion people are obese,
[231]
while in the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an "
obesity epidemic
."
[232]
Obesity is caused by consuming more
calories
than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.
[231]
Biological variation
Main article:
Human genetic variation
Changes in the number and order of genes (A-D) create genetic diversity within and between population.
There is biological variation in the human species - with traits such as
blood type
,
genetic diseases
,
cranial features
,
facial features
,
organ systems
,
eye color
,
hair color
and
texture
,
height
and
build
, and
skin color
varying across the globe. The typical height of an adult human is between 1.4 and 1.9 m (4 ft 7 in and 6 ft 3 in), although this varies significantly depending on sex,
ethnic origin
, and family bloodlines.
[233]
[234]
Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as
diet
, exercise, and
sleep patterns
.
[235]
There is evidence that populations have adapted genetically to various external factors. The genes that allow adult humans to
digest lactose
are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication and are more dependent on
cow milk
.
[236]
Sickle cell anemia
, which may provide increased resistance to
malaria
, is frequent in populations where
malaria
is endemic.
[237]
[238]
Populations that have for a very long time inhabited specific climates tend to have developed specific
phenotypes
that are beneficial for those environments -
short stature and stocky build in cold regions
, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities or other
adaptations at high altitudes
.
[239]
Some populations have evolved highly unique adaptations to very specific environmental conditions, such as those advantageous to ocean-dwelling lifestyles and
freediving
in the
Bajau
.
[240]
Human hair ranges in color from
red
to
blond
to
brown
to
black
, which is the most frequent.
[241]
Hair color depends on the amount of
melanin
, with concentrations fading with increased age, leading to
grey
or even white hair. Skin color can range from
darkest brown
to
lightest peach
, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of
albinism
.
[242]
It tends to vary
clinally
and generally correlates with the level of
ultraviolet radiation
in a particular geographic area, with darker skin mostly around the equator.
[243]
Skin darkening may have evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation.
[244]
Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of
vitamin D
, which requires
sunlight
to make.
[245]
Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
[246]
[247]

There is relatively little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that occurs is at the individual level.
[242]
[248]
[249]
Much of human variation is continuous, often with no clear points of demarcation.
[250]
[251]
[252]
[253]
Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are almost as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups.
[254]
[255]
[256]
Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia are not closely related to each other.
[257]
[258]
Genetic research has demonstrated that human populations native to the
African continent
are the most genetically diverse
[259]
and genetic diversity decreases with migratory distance from Africa, possibly the result of
bottlenecks
during human migration.
[260]
[261]
These non-African populations acquired new genetic inputs from local
admixture with archaic populations
and have much greater variation from
Neanderthals
and
Denisovans
than is found in Africa,
[178]
though Neanderthal admixture into African populations may be underestimated.
[262]
Furthermore, recent studies have found that populations in
sub-Saharan Africa
, and particularly
West Africa
, have ancestral genetic variation which predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations. Some of this ancestry is thought to originate from admixture with an
unknown archaic hominin
that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans.
[263]
[264]
Humans are a
gonochoric
species, meaning they are divided into male and female
sexes
.
[265]
[266]
[267]
The greatest degree of genetic
variation exists between males and females
. While the
nucleotide
genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%-0.5%, the genetic difference between
males
and
females
is between 1% and 2%. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15 cm (6 in) taller than females.
[268]
[269]
On average, men have about 40-50% more upper body strength and 20-30% more lower body strength than women at the same weight, due to higher amounts of muscle and larger muscle fibers.
[270]
Women generally have a higher
body fat
percentage than men.
[271]
Women have
lighter skin
than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D in females during pregnancy and
lactation
.
[272]
As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome-related conditions and
disorders
only affect either men or women.
[273]
After allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an
octave
deeper than the female voice.
[274]
Women have a
longer life span
in almost every population around the world.
[275]
There are
intersex
conditions in the human population, however these are rare.
[276]
Psychology
Main article:
Psychology
Drawing of the
human brain
, showing several important structures
The
human brain
, the focal point of the
central nervous system
in humans, controls the
peripheral nervous system
. In addition to controlling "lower", involuntary, or primarily
autonomic
activities such as
respiration
and
digestion
, it is also the locus of "higher" order functioning such as
thought
,
reasoning
, and
abstraction
.
[277]
These
cognitive processes
constitute the
mind
, and, along with their
behavioral
consequences, are studied in the field of
psychology
.
Humans have a larger and more developed
prefrontal cortex
than other primates, the region of the brain associated with higher
cognition
.
[278]
This has led humans to proclaim themselves to be more intelligent than any other known species.
[279]
Objectively defining intelligence is difficult, with other animals adapting senses and excelling in areas that humans are unable to.
[280]
There are some traits that, although not strictly unique, do set humans apart from other animals.
[281]
Humans may be the only animals who have
episodic memory
and who can engage in "
mental time travel
".
[282]
Even compared with other social animals, humans have an unusually high degree of flexibility in their facial expressions.
[283]
Humans are the only animals known to cry emotional tears.
[284]
Humans are one of the few animals able to self-recognize in
mirror tests
[285]
and there is also debate over to what extent humans are the only animals with a
theory of mind
.
[286]
Sleep and dreaming
Main articles:
Sleep
and
Dream
Humans are generally
diurnal
. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though
sleep deprivation
can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.
[287]
During sleep humans dream, where they experience sensory images and sounds. Dreaming is stimulated by the
pons
and mostly occurs during the
REM phase of sleep
.
[288]
The length of a dream can vary, from a few seconds up to 30 minutes.
[289]
Humans have three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven.
[290]
Dreamers are more likely to remember the dream if awakened during the REM phase. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of
lucid dreaming
, where the dreamer is
self-aware
.
[291]
Dreams can at times make a
creative
thought occur or give a sense of
inspiration
.
[292]
Consciousness and thought
Main articles:
Consciousness
and
Cognition
Human consciousness, at its simplest, is
sentience
or
awareness
of internal or external existence.
[293]
Despite centuries of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial,
[294]
being "at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives".
[295]
The only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that it exists.
[296]
Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is sensory experience itself, and access consciousness, which can be used for reasoning or directly controlling actions.
[297]
It is sometimes synonymous with 'the mind', and at other times, an aspect of it. Historically it is associated with
introspection
, private
thought
,
imagination
and
volition
.
[298]
It now often includes some kind of
experience
,
cognition
,
feeling
or
perception
. It may be 'awareness', or '
awareness of awareness
', or
self-awareness
.
[299]
There might be different levels or
orders of consciousness
,
[300]
or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.
[301]
The process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses is known as cognition.
[302]
The human brain
perceives
the external world through the
senses
, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to
subjective
views of
existence
and the passage of time.
[303]
The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields.
Cognitive psychology
studies
cognition
, the
mental processes
underlying behavior.
[304]
Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span,
developmental psychology
seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age.
[305]
[306]
This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or
moral development
.
Psychologists
have developed intelligence tests and the concept of
intelligence quotient
in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its
distribution
among population.
[307]
Motivation and emotion
Main articles:
Motivation
and
Emotion
Illustration of grief from
Charles Darwin
's 1872 book
The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals
Human motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective,
Maslow's hierarchy of needs
is a well-established theory that can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.
[308]
From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore,
incentive
and
preference
are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences.
Volition
may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and
realization
of goals in an optimal manner, a
function
beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as
socialization
.
[309]
Emotions are
biological
states associated with the nervous system
[310]
[311]
brought on by
neurophysiological
changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of
pleasure
or
displeasure
.
[312]
[313]
They are often
intertwined
with
mood
,
temperament
,
personality
,
disposition
,
creativity
,
[314]
and motivation. Emotion has a significant influence on human behavior and their ability to learn.
[315]
Acting on extreme or uncontrolled emotions can lead to social disorder and crime,
[316]
with studies showing criminals may have a lower
emotional intelligence
than normal.
[317]
Emotional experiences perceived as
pleasant
, such as
joy
,
interest
or
contentment
, contrast with those perceived as
unpleasant
, like
anxiety
,
sadness
,
anger
, and
despair
.
[318]
Happiness
, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some define it as experiencing the
feeling
of positive
emotional affects
, while avoiding the negative ones.
[319]
[320]
Others see it as an appraisal of
life satisfaction
or
quality of life
.
[321]
Recent research suggests that being happy might involve experiencing some negative emotions when humans feel they are warranted.
[322]
Sexuality and love
Main articles:
Human sexuality
and
Love
Human parents often display
familial love
for their children.
For humans, sexuality involves
biological
,
erotic
,
physical
,
emotional
,
social
, or
spiritual
feelings and behaviors.
[323]
[324]
Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition.
[324]
The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the
human reproductive functions
, including the
human sexual response cycle
.
[323]
[324]
Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical,
moral
,
ethical
, and religious aspects of life.
[323]
[324]
Sexual desire, or
libido
, is a basic mental state present at the beginning of sexual behavior. Studies show that men desire sex more than women and
masturbate
more often.
[325]
Humans can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of
sexual orientation
,
[326]
although most humans are
heterosexual
.
[327]
[328]
While
homosexual
behavior
occurs in some other animals
, only humans and
domestic sheep
have so far been found to exhibit exclusive preference for same-sex relationships.
[327]
Most evidence supports nonsocial,
biological causes of sexual orientation
,
[327]
as cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it.
[328]
[329]
Research in
neuroscience
and
genetics
suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.
[330]
Love most commonly refers to a feeling of strong attraction or emotional
attachment
. It can be impersonal (the love of an object, ideal, or strong political or spiritual connection) or interpersonal (love between humans).
[331]
When in love
dopamine
,
norepinephrine
,
serotonin
and other chemicals stimulate the brain's
pleasure center

Humanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant domination of the biosphere.
[336]
Disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information,
[337]
innately deploy recursive
embedding
to generate and communicate complex concepts,
[338]
engage in the "
folk physics
" required for competent tool design,
[339]
[340]
or cook food in the wild.
[341]
Teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of human societies.

[344]
and

[345]
Language
Main article:
Language
While many species
communicate
,
language
is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a
cultural universal
.
[346]
Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open - an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols.
[347]
[348]
Human language also has the capacity of
displacement
, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.
[148]
Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is
modality independent
; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, audibly in
speech
, visually by
sign language
or writing, and through tactile media such as
braille
.
[349]
Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups.
[350]
There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are
extinct
.
[351]
The arts
Main article:
The arts
Human arts can take many forms including
visual
,
literary
and
performing
. Visual art can range from
paintings
and
sculptures
to
film
,
interaction design
and
architecture
.
[352]
Literary arts can include
prose
,
poetry
and
dramas
; while the performing arts generally involve
theatre
,
music
and
dance
.
[353]
[354]
Humans often combine the different forms (for example, music videos).
[355]
Other entities that have been described as having artistic qualities include
food preparation
,
video games
and
medicine
.
[356]
[357]
[358]
As well as providing entertainment and transferring knowledge, the arts are also used for
political purposes
.
[359]
The

Art
is a defining characteristic of humans and there is evidence for a relationship between creativity and language.
[360]
The earliest evidence of art was shell engravings made by
Homo erectus
300,000 years before modern humans evolved.
[361]
Art attributed to
H. sapiens
existed at least 75,000 years ago, with jewellery and drawings found in caves in South Africa.
[362]
[363]
There are various hypotheses as to why humans have
adapted
to the arts. These include allowing them to better problem solve issues, providing a means to control or influence other humans, encouraging cooperation and contribution within a society or increasing the chance of attracting a potential mate.
[364]
The use of imagination developed through art, combined with logic may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.
[360]
Evidence of humans engaging in musical activities predates cave art and so far music has been
practiced by virtually all known human cultures
.
[365]
There exists a wide variety of
music genres
and
ethnic musics
; with humans' musical abilities being related to other abilities, including complex social human behaviours.
[365]
It has been shown that human brains respond to music by becoming synchronized with the rhythm and beat, a process called
entrainment
.
[366]
Dance is also a form of human expression found in all cultures
[367]
and may have evolved as a way to help early humans communicate.
[368]
Listening to music and observing dance stimulates the
orbitofrontal cortex
and other pleasure sensing areas of the brain.
[369]
Unlike speaking, reading and writing does not come naturally to humans and must be taught.
[370]
Still,
literature
has been present before the invention of words and language, with 30,000-year-old paintings on walls inside some caves portraying a series of dramatic scenes.
[371]
One of the oldest surviving works of literature is the
Epic of Gilgamesh
, first engraved on ancient
Babylonian
tablets about 4,000 years ago.
[372]
Beyond simply passing down knowledge, the use and sharing of imaginative
fiction
through stories might have helped develop humans' capabilities for communication and increased the likelihood of securing a mate.
[373]
Storytelling may also be used as a way to provide the audience with moral lessons and encourage cooperation.

[374]
Stone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.
[375]
The use and manufacture of tools has been put forward as the ability that defines humans more than anything else
[376]
and has historically been seen as an important evolutionary step.
[377]
The technology became much more sophisticated about 1.8 million years ago,
[376]
with the
controlled use of fire
beginning around 1 million years ago.
[378]
[379]
The wheel and wheeled vehicles appeared simultaneously in several regions some time in the fourth millennium BC.
[61]
The development of more complex tools and technologies allowed land to be
cultivated
and animals to be
domesticated
, thus proving essential in the development of
agriculture
- what is known as the
Neolithic Revolution
.
[380]
China developed
paper
, the
printing press
,
gunpowder
, the
compass
and
other important inventions
.
[381]
The continued improvements in
smelting
allowed
forging
of copper, bronze, iron and eventually
steel
, which is used in
railways
,
skyscrapers
and many other products.
[382]
This coincided with the
Industrial Revolution
, where the invention of automated machines brought major changes to humans' lifestyles.
[383]
Modern technology is observed as
progressing exponentially
,
[384]
with major innovations in the 20th century including:
electricity
,
penicillin
,
semiconductors
,
internal combustion engines
, the
Internet
,
nitrogen fixing fertilisers

Religion is generally defined as a
belief
system concerning the
supernatural
,
sacred
or
divine
, and practices,
values
, institutions and
rituals
associated with such belief. Some religions also have a
moral code
. The
evolution
and the history of the
first religions
have become areas of active scientific investigation.
[386]
[387]
[388]
While the exact time when humans first became religious remains unknown, research shows credible evidence of religious behaviour from around the
Middle Paleolithic
era (45-200
thousand years ago
).
[389]
It may have evolved to play a role in helping enforce and encourage cooperation between humans.
[390]
There is no accepted academic definition of what constitutes religion.
[391]
Religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective in alignment with the geographic, social, and linguistic diversity of the planet.
[391]
Religion can include a belief in life after death (commonly involving belief in an
afterlife
),
[392]
the
origin of life
,
[
citation needed
]
the nature of the
universe
(
religious cosmology
) and its
ultimate fate
(
eschatology
), and what is
moral
or immoral.
[393]
A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in
transcendent
divine beings such as
deities
or a singular
God
, although not all religions are
theistic
.
[394]
[395]
Although the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,
[396]
a majority of humans profess some variety of religious or spiritual belief.
[397]
In 2015 the plurality were
Christian
followed by
Muslims
,
Hindus
and
Buddhists
.
[398]
As of 2015, about 16%, or slightly under 1.2 billion humans, were
irreligious
, including those with no religious beliefs or no identity with any religion.

An aspect unique to humans is their ability to
transmit knowledge
from one generation to the next and to continually build on this information to develop tools,
scientific laws
and other advances to pass on further.
[400]
This accumulated knowledge can be tested to answer questions or make predictions about how the universe functions and has been very successful in advancing human ascendancy.
[401]
Aristotle
has been described as the first scientist,
[402]
and preceded the rise of scientific thought through the
Hellenistic period
.
[403]
Other early advances in science came from the
Han Dynasty
in China and during the
Islamic Golden Age
.
[404]
[86]
The
scientific revolution
, near the end of the
Renaissance
, led to the emergence of
modern science
.
[405]
A chain of events and influences led to the development of the
scientific method
, a process of observation and experimentation that is used to differentiate science from
pseudoscience
.
[406]
An understanding of
mathematics
is unique to humans, although other species of animals have some
numerical cognition
.
[407]
All of science can be divided into three major branches, the
formal sciences
(e.g.,
logic
and
mathematics
), which are concerned with
formal systems
, the
applied sciences
(e.g., engineering, medicine), which are focused on practical applications, and the empirical sciences, which are based on
empirical observation
and are in turn divided into
natural sciences
(e.g.,
physics
,
chemistry
,
biology
) and
social sciences
(e.g.,
psychology
, economics, sociology).
[408]
Philosophy is a field of study where humans seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves and the world in which they live.
[409]
Philosophical inquiry has been a major feature in the development of humans' intellectual history.
[410]
It has been described as the "no man's land" between definitive scientific knowledge and dogmatic religious teachings.
[411]
Philosophy relies on reason and evidence, unlike religion, but does not require the empirical observations and experiments provided by science.
[412]
Major fields of philosophy include
metaphysics
,
epistemology
,
logic
, and
axiology
(which includes
ethics
and
aesthetics
).
[413]
Society
Main article:
Society
Humans often live in family-based social structures
Society is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. Humans are highly social and tend to live in large complex social groups. They can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth,
power
,
reputation
and other factors. The structure of
social stratification
and the degree of
social mobility
differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.
[414]
[
unreliable source?
]
Human groups range from the size of
families
to nations. The first form of human social organization is thought to have resembled
hunter-gatherer
band societies
.
[415]
[

Gender
Main article:
Gender
Human societies typically exhibit
gender identities
and
gender roles
that distinguish between
masculine
and
feminine
characteristics and prescribe the range of acceptable behaviours and attitudes for their members based on their
sex
.
[416]
[417]
The most common categorisation is a
gender binary
of
men
and
women
.
[418]
Many societies recognise a
third gender
,
[419]
or less commonly a fourth or fifth.
[420]
[421]
In some other societies,
non-binary
is used as an umbrella term for a range of gender identities that are not solely male or female.
[422]
Gender roles are often associated with a division of
norms
,
practices
,
dress
,
behavior
,
rights
,
duties
,
privileges
,
status
, and
power
, with men enjoying more rights and privileges than women in most societies, both today and in the past.
[423]
As a
social construct
,
[424]
gender roles are not fixed and vary historically within a society. Challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.
[425]
[426]
Little is known about gender roles in the earliest human societies.
Early modern humans
probably had a range of gender roles similar to that of modern cultures from at least the
Upper Paleolithic
, while the
Neanderthals
were less sexually dimorphic and there is evidence that the behavioural difference between males and females was minimal.
[427]
Kinship
Main article:
Kinship
All human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (
consanguinity
), and relations through
marriage
(
affinity
). There is also a third type applied to
godparents
or
adoptive children
(
fictive
). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and
inheritance
.
[428]
All societies have rules of
incest taboo
, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited, and some also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations.
[429]
Ethnicity
Main article:
Ethnic group
Human ethnic groups are a social category that
identifies
together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These can be a common set of traditions,
ancestry
,
language
,
history
,
society
,
culture
,
nation
,
religion
, or social treatment within their residing area.
[430]
[431]
Ethnicity is separate from the concept of
race
, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are
socially constructed
.
[432]
Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level.
[170]
Also, there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group.
[433]
Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the
social identity
and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. This has been closely tied to the rise of the
nation state
as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.
[434]

Government and politics
Main articles:

The
United Nations headquarters
in New York City, which houses one of the world's largest political organizations
As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between these different groups increased. This led to the development of governance within and between the communities.
[437]
Humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with various social groups relatively easily, including previously strong political alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages.
[438]
This
cognitive flexibility
allows individual humans to change their political ideologies, with those with higher flexibility less likely to support authoritarian and nationalistic stances.
[439]
Governments create
laws
and
policies
that affect the citizens that they govern. There have been
many forms of government
throughout human history, each having various means of obtaining power and the ability to exert diverse controls on the population.
[440]
As of 2017, more than half of all national governments are
democracies
, with 13% being
autocracies
and 28% containing elements of both.
[441]
Many countries have formed
international political organizations and alliances
; the largest of these is the
United Nations
, with 193 member states.

Trade and economics
Main articles:

(red) and spice
trade routes
(blue)
Trade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals and has been cited as a practice that gave
Homo sapiens
a major advantage over other hominids.
[443]
Evidence suggests early
H. sapiens
made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to
cultural explosions
and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse, while such trade networks did not exist for the now extinct Neanderthals.
[444]
[445]
Early trade likely involved materials for creating tools like
obsidian
.
[446]
The first truly international trade routes were around the
spice trade
through the Roman and medieval periods.
[447]
Early human
economies
were more likely to be based around
gift giving
instead of a
bartering
system.
[448]
Early
money
consisted of
commodities
; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being
cowrie shells
.
[449]
Money has since evolved into governmental issued
coins
,
paper
and
electronic money
.
[449]
Human study of economics is a
social science
that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people.
[450]
There are massive
inequalities
in the division of
wealth
among humans; the eight richest humans are worth the same monetary value as the poorest half of all the human population.
[451]
Conflict
See also:
War
and
Violence
A depiction of war on the
Stele of the Vultures
Humans commit violence on other humans at a rate comparable to other primates, but have an increased preference for killing adults,
infanticide
being more common among other primates.
[452]
It is predicted that 2% of early
H. sapiens
would be
murdered
, rising to 12% during the medieval period, before dropping to below 2% in modern times.
[453]
There is great variation in violence between human populations with rates of homicide in societies that have
legal systems
and strong cultural attitudes against violence at about 0.01%.
[454]
The willingness of humans to kill other members of their species en masse through organized conflict (i.e., war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought holds that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and has always been an innate human characteristic. Another suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and has appeared due to changing social conditions.
[455]
While not settled, current evidence indicates warlike predispositions only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many places much more recently than that.
[455]
War has had a high cost on human life; it is estimated that during the 20th century, between 167 million and 188 million people died as a result of war.
[456]
War casualty data is less reliable for pre-medieval times, especially global figures. But compared with any period over the past 600 years, the last ~80 years (post 1946), has seen a very significant drop in global military and civilian death rates due to armed conflict.

Butyl rubber gloves
Butyl rubber
, sometimes just called "butyl", is a
synthetic rubber
, a
copolymer
of
isobutylene
with
isoprene
. The abbreviation IIR stands for isobutylene isoprene rubber.
Polyisobutylene
, also known as "PIB" or polyisobutene, (C
4
H
8
)
n
, is the
homopolymer
of isobutylene, or 2-methyl-1-propene, on which butyl rubber is based. Butyl rubber is produced by polymerization of about 98% of isobutylene with about 2% of isoprene. Structurally, polyisobutylene resembles
polypropylene
, but has two
methyl groups
substituted on every other
carbon
atom, rather than one. Polyisobutylene is a colorless to light yellow
viscoelastic
material. It is generally odorless and tasteless, though it may exhibit a slight characteristic odor.
Properties
[
edit
]
Butyl rubber has excellent impermeability to gas diffusion, and the long polyisobutylene segments of its
polymer
chains give it good flex properties.
The formula for PIB is:
-(-CH
2
-C(CH
3
)
2
-)
n
-
The formula for IIR is:
It can be made from the
monomer
isobutylene (CH
2
=C(CH
3
)
2
) only via
cationic addition polymerization
.
A synthetic rubber, or
elastomer
, butyl rubber is impermeable to air and used in many applications requiring an airtight rubber. Polyisobutylene and butyl rubber are used in the manufacture of
adhesives
, agricultural chemicals,
fiber optic
compounds, ball bladders,
O-rings
,
caulks
and sealants,
cling film
, electrical fluids, lubricants (2 stroke engine oil), paper and pulp, personal care products,
pigment
concentrates, for rubber and polymer modification, for protecting and sealing certain equipment for use in areas where chemical weapons are present, as a
gasoline
/
diesel
fuel additive
, and
chewing gum
. The first major application of butyl rubber was
tire inner tubes
. This remains an important segment of its market even today.
History
[
edit
]
Isobutylene was discovered by
Michael Faraday
in 1825. Polyisobutylene (PIB) was first developed by the
BASF
unit of
IG Farben
in 1931 using a boron trifluoride catalyst at low temperatures and sold under the trade name
Oppanol B
[
de
]
. PIB remains a core business for BASF to this day.
It was later developed into butyl rubber in 1937, by researchers
William J. Sparks
and
Robert M. Thomas
, at
Standard Oil
of New Jersey's
Linden
, N.J., laboratory. Today, the majority of the global supply of butyl rubber is produced by two companies,
ExxonMobil
(one of the descendants of Standard Oil) and Polymer Corporation, a Canadian federal crown corporation established in 1942 to produce artificial rubber to substitute for overseas supply cut off by World War II. It was renamed Polysar in 1976 and the rubber component became a subsidiary, Polysar Rubber Corp. The company was privatized in 1988 with its sale to NOVA Corp which, in turn, sold Polysar Rubber in 1990 to Bayer AG of Germany. In 2005 Bayer AG spun off chemical divisions, including most of the Sarnia site, creating LANXESS AG, also of Germany.
[1]
PIB homopolymers of high molecular weight (100,000-400,000 or more) are polyolefin elastomers: tough extensible rubber-like materials over a wide temperature range; with low density (0.913-0.920), low permeability and excellent electrical properties.
In the 1950s and 1960s,
halogenated
butyl rubber (
halobutyl
) was developed, in its chlorinated (
chlorobutyl
) and brominated (
bromobutyl
) variants, providing significantly higher curing rates and allowing covulcanization with other rubbers such as
natural rubber
and
styrene-butadiene
rubber. Halobutyl is today the most important material for the inner linings of
tubeless tires
.
Francis P. Baldwin
received the 1979
Charles Goodyear Medal
for the many patents he held for these developments.
In the spring of 2013 two incidents of PIB contamination in the English Channel, believed to be connected, were described as the worst UK
marine pollution
'for decades'. The RSPB estimated over 2,600 seabirds were killed by the chemical and hundreds more were rescued and decontaminated.
[2]
Uses
[
edit
]
Fuel and lubricant additive
[
edit
]
Polyisobutylene can be reacted with
maleic anhydride
to make
polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride
(PIBSA), which can then be converted into
polyisobutenylsuccinimides
(PIBSI) by reacting it with various
ethyleneamines
. When used as an additive in
lubricating oils
and motor fuels, they can have a substantial effect on the properties of the oil or fuel.
[3]
[4]
Polyisobutylene added in small amounts to the lubricating oils used in
machining
results in a significant reduction in the generation of oil mist and thus reduces the operator's inhalation of
oil mist
.
[5]
It is also used to clean up waterborne
oil spills
as part of the commercial product
Elastol
. When added to
crude oil
it increases the oil's
viscoelasticity
when pulled, causing the oil to resist breakup when it is vacuumed from the surface of the water.
As a
fuel additive
, polyisobutylene has
detergent
properties. When added to
diesel fuel
, it resists fouling of
fuel injectors
, leading to reduced hydrocarbon and
particulate emissions
.
[6]
It is blended with other detergents and additives to make a "detergent package" that is added to
gasoline
and diesel fuel to resist buildup of deposits and
engine knock
.
[7]
Polyisobutylene is used in some formulations as a
thickening agent
.
Explosives
[
edit
]
Polyisobutylene is often used by the
explosives
industry as a binding agent in plastic explosives such as
C-4
.
[8]
Polyisobutylene binder is used because it makes the explosive more insensitive to premature detonation as well as making it easier to handle and mold.
Speakers and audio equipment
[
edit
]
Butyl rubber is generally used in speakers, specifically the surrounds. It was used as a replacement for foam surrounds because the foam would deteriorate. The majority of modern speakers use butyl rubber, while most vintage speakers use foam.
Sporting equipment
[
edit
]
Butyl rubber is used for the bladders in sporting balls (e.g. Rugby balls,
footballs
, basketballs,
netballs
) and to make bicycle inner tubes to provide a tough, airtight inner compartment.
Damp proofing and roof repair
[
edit
]
Butyl rubber sealant is used for
damp proofing
, rubber
roof
repair and for maintenance of roof membranes (especially around the edges). It is important
[
citation needed
]
to have the roof membrane fixed, as a lot of fixtures (e.g., air conditioner vents, plumbing, and other pipes) can considerably loosen it.
Rubber roofing typically refers to a specific type of roofing materials that are made of ethylene propylene diene monomers (
EPDM rubber
). It is crucial to the integrity of such roofs to avoid using harsh abrasive materials and petroleum-based solvents for their maintenance.
Polyester fabric laminated to butyl rubber binder provides a single-sided waterproof tape that can be used on metal, PVC, and cement joints. It is used for repairing and waterproofing metal roofs.
Gas masks and chemical agent protection
[
edit
]
Butyl rubber is one of the most robust elastomers when subjected to
chemical warfare agents
and
decontamination
materials. It is a harder and less porous material than other elastomers, such as natural rubber or silicone, but still has enough elasticity to form an airtight seal. While butyl rubber will break down when exposed to agents such as NH
3
(
ammonia
) or certain solvents, it breaks down more slowly than comparable elastomers. It is therefore used to create seals in
gas masks
and other protective clothing.
Pharmaceutical stoppers
[
edit
]
Butyl and bromobutyl rubber are commonly used for manufacturing rubber stoppers used for sealing medicine
vials
and
bottles
.
[9]
Chewing gum
[
edit
]
Gumdrop chewing gum collecting bin
Most modern
chewing gum
uses food-grade butyl rubber as the central gum base, which contributes not only the gum's elasticity but also gives it a stubborn, sticky quality which has led some municipalities to propose taxation to cover costs of its removal.
[10]
Recycled chewing gum has also been used as a source of recovered polyisobutylene. Amongst other products, this base rubber has been manufactured into coffee cups and 'Gumdrop' gum-collecting bins.
[11]
[12]
When filled, the collecting bins and their contents are shredded together and recycled again.
Tires
[
edit
]
Because of their superior resistance to gas
diffusion
, butyl rubber and halogenated rubber are used for the innerliner inside pneumatic
tubeless tires
, and for the
inner tube
in older tires.
Insulating windows
[
edit
]
Polyisobutylene is used as the primary seal in an insulating glass unit for commercial and residential construction providing the air and moisture seal for the unit.

Peter Conover Hains Jr.
(January 9, 1872 - February 5, 1955) was a
United States Army
captain
convicted of killing his wife's lover. The case became a sensational
murder
trial in
New York City
in 1908. He was the son of Major General
Peter Conover Hains
and the father of
Peter C. Hains III
.
Hains attended the
United States Naval Academy
from 1889 to 1893, but did not graduate. He was commissioned into the United States Army in July 1898 with the rank of second lieutenant, serving with the artillery and achieving the rank of captain in December 1902.
[1]
In 1908, abetted by his brother, the novelist
Thornton Jenkins Hains
, Peter Hains gunned down prominent magazine editor and
Harper's
contributor William Annis at a yacht club in
Bayside, Queens
. The crime, known as the
Hains-Annis Case
or the "Murder at the Regatta," played an important role in the development of criminal and matrimonial law.
[2]
Peter Hains was convicted of manslaughter and received an eight-year sentence, but later received a pardon from the governor of New York. His brother pleaded temporary insanity and was acquitted of manslaughter.
The murder, committed while Hains was still an active duty Army officer, did not disqualify him from military service; after he had been convicted and incarcerated, following the passage of a Congressional act which would have allowed the dismissal of convicted service members, Hains resigned from the United States Army in 1911.
[3]
It was one of the last cases in which a defendant pleaded
Dementia Americana
, the psychiatric pathology that allegedly drove American men to kill the lovers of their unfaithful wives.
Harry Thaw
used a similar defense during his trial for the murder of architect
Stanford White
.
Leaving court
The trial was front-page news across the country at the time and ranks with the trials of
Josephine Terranova
and
Richard Bruno Hauptmann
as among the most widely watched and reported American criminal trials of the first half of the twentieth century.

Cthulhu
is a
cosmic entity
created by writer
H. P. Lovecraft
. It was introduced in his
short story
"
The Call of Cthulhu
",
[2]
published by the American
pulp magazine
Weird Tales
in 1928. Considered a
Great Old One
within the
pantheon
of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in the shape of a green
octopus
,
dragon
, and a
caricature
of human form. The Lovecraft-inspired universe, the
Cthulhu Mythos
, where it exists with its fellow entities, is named after it.
Etymology, spelling, and pronunciation
[
edit
]
Invented by Lovecraft in 1928, the name Cthulhu was probably chosen to echo the word
chthonic
(Ancient Greek "of the earth"), as apparently suggested by Lovecraft himself at the end of his 1923 tale "
The Rats in the Walls
".
[3]
The chthonic, or earth-dwelling, spirit has precedents in numerous ancient and medieval mythologies, often guarding mines and precious underground treasures, notably in the
Germanic
dwarfs
and the Greek
Chalybes
,
Telchines
, or
Dactyls
.
[4]
Lovecraft transcribed the pronunciation of
Cthulhu
as
Khlûl′-hloo
, and said, "the first syllable pronounced gutturally and very thickly. The 'u' is about like that in 'full', and the first syllable is not unlike 'klul' in sound, hence the 'h' represents the guttural thickness"
[5]
yielding something akin to
/χ(ə)ʟʊʟˈluː/
.
S. T. Joshi
points out, however, that Lovecraft gave different pronunciations on different occasions.
[6]
According to Lovecraft, this is merely the closest that the human vocal apparatus can come to reproducing the syllables of an alien language.
[7]
Cthulhu has also been spelled in many other ways, including Tulu, Katulu, and Kutulu.
[8]
Long after Lovecraft's death,
Chaosium
stated in the
Call of Cthulhu
role-playing game
: "we say it kuh-THOOL-hu" (
/
k
ə
ˈ
θ
uː
l
uː
/
), even while noting that Lovecraft said it differently.
[9]
Others use the pronunciation Katulu or Kutulu or
/
k
ə
ˈ
t
uː
l
uː
/
.
[10]
Description
[
edit
]
In "The Call of Cthulhu", H. P. Lovecraft describes a statue of Cthulhu as: "A monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind."
[11]
Cthulhu is said to resemble a green octopus, dragon, and a human caricature, hundreds of meters tall, with webbed, human-looking arms and legs and a pair of rudimentary wings on its back.
[11]
Its head is depicted as similar to the entirety of a
gigantic octopus
, with an unknown number of tentacles surrounding its supposed mouth.
Publication history
[
edit
]
The short story that first mentions Cthulhu, "The Call of Cthulhu", was published in
Weird Tales
in 1928, and established the character as a malevolent entity, hibernating within
R'lyeh
, an underwater city in the
South Pacific
. The imprisoned Cthulhu is apparently the source of constant subconscious anxiety for all mankind, and is also the object of worship, both by many human cults (including some within
New Zealand
,
Greenland
,
Louisiana
, and the
Chinese mountains
) and by other Lovecraftian monsters (called
Deep Ones
[12]
and
Mi-Go
[13]
). The short story asserts the premise that, while currently trapped, Cthulhu will eventually return. His worshippers chant "
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
"
("In his house at
R'lyeh
, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming").
[11]
H. P. Lovecraft, Cthulhu's creator
Lovecraft conceived a detailed genealogy for Cthulhu (published as "Letter 617" in
Selected Letters
)
[1]
and made the character a central reference in his works.
[14]
The short story "
The Dunwich Horror
" (1928)
[15]
refers to Cthulhu, while "
The Whisperer in Darkness
" (1930) hints that one of his characters knows the creature's origins ("I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth.")
[13]
The 1931
novella
At the Mountains of Madness
refers to the "star-spawn of Cthulhu", who warred with another race called the
Elder Things
before the dawn of man.
[16]
August Derleth
, a correspondent of Lovecraft's, used the creature's name to identify the system of lore employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors, the
Cthulhu Mythos
. In 1937, Derleth wrote the short story "The Return of Hastur", and proposed two groups of opposed cosmic entities:
the Old or Ancient Ones, the
Elder Gods
, of
cosmic good
, and those of
cosmic evil
, bearing many names, and themselves of different groups, as if associated with the elements and yet transcending them: for there are the Water Beings, hidden in the depths; those of Air that are the primal lurkers beyond time; those of Earth, horrible animate survivors of distant eons.
[17]
: 256
According to Derleth's scheme, "Great Cthulhu is one of the Water Elementals" and was engaged in an age-old arch-rivalry with a designated air elemental,
Hastur the Unspeakable
, described as Cthulhu's "half-brother."
[17]
: 256, 266
Based on this framework, Derleth wrote a series of short stories published in
Weird Tales
(1944-1952) and collected as
The Trail of Cthulhu
, depicting the struggle of a Dr. Laban Shrewsbury and his associates against Cthulhu and his minions. In addition, Cthulhu is referenced in Derleth's 1945 novel
The Lurker at the Threshold
published by
Arkham House
. The novel can also be found in
The Watchers Out of Time and Others
, a collection of stories from Derleth's interpretations of Lovecraftian Mythos published by Arkham House in 1974.
Derleth's interpretations have been criticized by Lovecraft enthusiast
Michel Houellebecq
, among others. Houellebecq's
H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life
(2005) decries Derleth for attempting to reshape Lovecraft's strictly amoral continuity into a stereotypical conflict between forces of objective good and evil.
[18]
In
John Glasby
's "A Shadow from the Aeons", Cthulhu is seen by the narrator roaming the riverbank near Dominic Waldron's castle, and roaring.
[19]
The character's influence also extended into gaming literature; games company
TSR
included an entire chapter on the Cthulhu mythos (including character statistics) in the first printing of
Dungeons & Dragons
sourcebook
Deities & Demigods
(1980). TSR, however, were unaware that
Arkham House
, which asserted copyright on almost all Lovecraft literature, had already licensed the Cthulhu property to game company
Chaosium
. Although Chaosium stipulated that TSR could continue to use the material if each future edition featured a published credit to Chaosium, TSR refused and the material was removed from all subsequent editions.

Politics
[
edit

Main article:
Cthulhu for President
Poster from the
2010 Polish presidential election
: The caption translates as "Choose the greater evil. Vote Cthulhu."
Cthulhu has appeared as a
parody candidate
in several elections, including the
2010 Polish presidential election
and the
2012
and
2016 US presidential elections
.
[21]
[22]
The faux campaigns usually satirize voters who claim to vote for the "
lesser evil
".
In 2016, the
troll
account known as "The Dark Lord Cthulhu" submitted an official application to be on the
Massachusetts
Presidential Ballot. The account also raised over $4000 from fans to fund the campaign through a gofundme.com page. Gofundme removed the campaign page and refunded contributions.
The Cthulhu Party (UK), another pseudo-political organisation, claim to be 'Changing Politics for Evil', parodying the
Brexit Party
's 'Changing Politics for Good'; a member of The Cthulhu Party holds the position of Mayor of the museum town
Blists Hill
.
Another organization, Cthulhu for America, ran during the 2016 American presidential election, drawing comparisons with other satirical presidential candidates such as
Vermin Supreme
.
[23]
The organization had a platform that included the legalization of human sacrifice, driving all Americans insane, and an end to peace.
[24]
Science
[
edit
]
Several organisms have been named after Cthulhu, including the California spider
Pimoa cthulhu
,
[25]
the New Guinea moth
Speiredonia cthulhui
,
[26]
and
Sollasina cthulhu
, a fossil echinoderm.
[27]
Two microorganisms that assist in the digestion of wood by termites have been named after Cthulhu and Cthulhu's "daughter" Cthylla:
Cthulhu macrofasciculumque
and
Cthylla microfasciculumque
.
[28]
In 2014, science and technology scholar
Donna Haraway
gave a talk entitled "Anthropocene, Capitalocene, Chthulucene: Staying with the Trouble", in which she proposed the term "Chthulucene" as an alternative for the concept of the
Anthropocene
era, due to the entangling interconnectedness of all supposedly individual beings.
[29]
Haraway has denied any indebtedness to Lovecraft's Cthulhu, claiming that her "chthulu" is derived from Greek
khthonios
, "of the earth".
[30]
However, the Lovecraft character is much closer to her coined term than the Greek root, and her description of its meaning coincides with Lovecraft's idea of the apocalyptic, multitentacled threat of Cthulhu to collapse civilization into an endless dark horror: "Chthulucene does not close in on itself; it does not round off; its contact zones are ubiquitous and continuously spin out loopy tendrils."
[31]
In 2015, an elongated, dark region along the equator of
Pluto
, initially referred to as "the Whale", was proposed to be named "Cthulhu Regio", by the NASA team responsible for the
New Horizons
mission.
[32]
It is now known as "
Cthulhu Macula
".

Motvind Norge
Founded
7 September 2019
Headquarters
Oslo
Location
Norway
Website
Motvind Norge
(
transl.
Headwind Norway
, abbreviated
MN
) is a Norwegian organization that fights against
wind power
development in
Norway
. The organization's purpose is to stop the development of wind power plants in Norway, regardless of planning and development status, and "
transl.
wishes to help homeowners and land owners who feel run over by the wind power developers
".
[1]
MN was established on 7 September 2019,
[2]
and had its first national meeting in
Frøya
on 16 November 2019,
[3]
as an association of local action groups.
[4]
[5]
Rune Haaland
was employed as the organization's first general secretary.
[6]
The organization refers to wind power projects as an "
transl.
assault on nature, the environment and local communities, and a violation of people's sense of justice.
"
[4]
Actions
[
edit
]
During the
coronavirus pandemic
in 2019-2020, Motvind Norge blocked County Road 465 at
Kvinesdal
with chains.
[7]
The police had to intervene and one person was fined.
[8]
In May 2020, the development of a wind power plant was tried in court for the first time. The case was between Motvind Norge and the Vardafjellet Wind Power Plant, and Motvind Norge wanted to stop the development through a temporary
injunction
.
[9]
The court noted that it is not a superior administrative body with conversion competence, and Motvind Norge lost the case and had to pay court costs of 1,366,934 NOK (≈ 126,072 USD).
[10]
[11]
In July 2023, demonstrators at
Fosen
were removed by the police. The
Supreme Court
ruled in 2011 that the concession for the wind power plants at Storheia and Roan were illegal, and the demonstrators protested that the state did not follow up on the verdict.

Bilateral relations
Mongolia-Norway relations
Mongolia
Norway
Mongolia-Norway relations
refers to the
bilateral relationship
of
Mongolia
and
Norway
. Diplomatic relations were established  on 11 January 1968.
[1]
Neither country has a resident embassy. Mongolia is represented to Norway via its embassy in
Brussels
, while Norway is represented in Mongolia by its embassy in
Beijing
.  There is also a Norwegian honorary consulate general in the Mongolian capital
Ulaanbaatar
. Mongolia plans to establish an embassy in
Stockholm
and move the representative in Brussels. The move is to facilitate the development of bilateral contacts and have stronger relations between Norway and Mongolia.
[2]
Humanitarian aid
[
edit
]
There are currently about 20
Norwegians
in Mongolia, and most of them are related to the work of the
Norwegian Lutheran Mission
(
NLM
).
[1]
NLM
has performed development activities in Mongolia since 1994.
[3]
NLM has 16 envoys in Mongolia working on four
humanitarian aid
projects funded by
Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation
. The organization also provides financial support to churches and other Christian organizations.
[3]
The
Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation
also funds other programs in Mongolia. Their
Save the Children Norway
program provides money to the Mongolian Child Rights Centre.
[4]
The Government of Norway has promoted the commercialization of super-insulating materials in the housing sector in Mongolia in coordination with the Global Environment Facility, the
United Nations Development Program
Mongolia, and the Mongolian Ministry of Infrastructure and provided technical and financial support in building energy efficient housing.
[5]
In 2007, the total Norwegian aid to Mongolia amounted to 5.4 million
NOK
.
[1]
Official Visits
[
edit
]
There has traditionally been only modest diplomatic contact between Mongolia and Norway, though according to Norwegian foreign minister
Jonas Gahr Støre
bilateral relations have been "good and fruitful"  ever since they were established.
[6]
Haakon, the Crown Prince of Norway
, visited  Mongolia in November 2008 as the
goodwill ambassador
for the
United Nations Development Programme
.
[6]
[7]
[8]
Mongolia was at a crossroads and had to decide if it will make full of use its economic growth to reach the
Millennium Development Goals
.
[9]
At the Kaan Bank Theatre in Mongoliahe said:
[It] is quite interesting to note that Mongolia and Norway were both at their height of power about the same time at the beginning of the second millennium. ... In modern times, we share a relatively recent independent statehood. Both our countries are committed to a democratic way of government and to the rule of law. In this regard, I am happy to learn that Norway has given support to the UNDP’s efforts aimed at strengthening democratic institutions in Mongolia, and that there are fruitful relations between the Parliaments in our respective countries. Both our countries are large in size with comparatively small populations. We share the fortune of having a significant wealth of natural resources, upon which our prosperity largely depends. ... As small nations, Norway and Mongolia also share a belief in multilateral co-operation based on international law, with the United Nations at the centre.
[10]
Nambaryn Enkhbayar
, the Mongolian president used the visit as an opportunity to ask the
crown prince
for
humanitarian aid
from Norway.
[11]
The Crown Prince's visit marked the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Norway and Mongolia, which also saw the foreign ministers of the two nations exchange  congratulations.
[6]
Kirsti Kolle Grøndahl
, the
President of the Norwegian Parliament
, along with
Jørgen Kosmo
visited Mongolia, in 1999 and again in 2004. In 2001 deputy-speaker
J. Byambadorj
visited Norway where he met with the speaker of the Norwegian parliament on the cooperation between the two countries including
developmental aid
.
[1]
[12]
[13]
Vice President of the Norwegian Parliament
Carl I. Hagen
represented Norway during Mongolia's 800-year anniversary in 2006. Jørgen Kosmo, now
Auditor General of Norway
, visited the country in 2007 to launch an aid-funded collaboration on capacity building. The chairman of the Mongolian parliament (the

Willem "Wim" van Est
(25 March 1923 - 1 May 2003) was a Dutch
racing cyclist

general classification in the Tour de France
of 1951, and for falling into a ravine while wearing it.

Biography
[
edit
]
Wim van Est with wife and children in 1954
Van Est was born in the town of
Fijnaart
, in
North Brabant
, the 2nd child in a family of 16 children. His family was pushed into poverty in the aftermath of
World War One
and growing up he lived on a makeshift farm. During this time one of his brothers died at a very young age and his father had to make a coffin for the child, and ride several miles on his bike while carrying the coffin with his son inside to the local church to give the child a proper burial.
During
World War 2
the teenage Van Est began riding a considerable distance into
Belgium
smuggling tobacco and cheese which he would either sell or trade for soap, which he would return home with in order to sell on the Black Market. He was caught doing this during the war and had to serve six months in prison. After this,
while the Nazi's occupied his homeland
, the teenage Van Est got the idea cycling for sport. When the war was over and races began again he saw a local race and thought he could beat everyone, but it would take him five years to reach the pro level.
[3]
He started his cycling career (as an amateur) in 1946, after a professional runner had seen him race in a local competition as part of a wager. His first major victory came in 1950, when he won the 600 km
Bordeaux-Paris
race.
In
1951
, Van Est was part of the Dutch team for the Tour de France. This would be the first time in his entire life he had ever seen mountains of this caliber, let alone tried riding up or descending one. In the 12th stage, from
Agen
to
Dax
, he escaped with a small group. He won the stage and gained 19 minutes on the leader, enough to move up to first place in the
general classification
. As the first Dutchman to wear the accompanying yellow jersey he was praised by the public and media at home.
The next day, in defence of his position, Van Est was chasing the leaders on the descent of the
Col d'Aubisque
. He was following
Fiorenzo Magni
on the descent, a very strong rider who had already won two
Giro's
as well as two Tour Stages, who had superior descending skill. Due to a flat tyre (according to Van Est himself), in conjunction with snow melt and many loose stones on the road he lost control of his bike and went over the cliff. He instinctively kicked his bike away as he fell and of the riders, officials and fans, Belgian rider
Roger Decock
was the only person to see him go over the ravine.
The ravine was approximately 1,000 feet or 300 meters deep, and much of it was steep enough that a falling person would continue falling all the way to the bottom. Van Est fell about 200 feet or 70 meters trying to grab at the saplings growing on the mountainside to break his fall. Fortunately he slowed and was able to grab hold of a small tree nearby a one meter wide outcrop, which he then made his way to. Even if he wanted to he could not climb back up or down, despite the fact he did not suffer any major injury.
As Van Est precariously sat overlooking a several hundred foot drop he began screaming for help. Fortunately Decock stopped when Van Est went over, giving up his 5th place in the overall standings dropping to 17th by the end of the Tour as a result of the 25 minutes he lost assisting the Dutchman.
[4]
When the Dutch team car arrived and were told what happened they screamed down the mountain for him for several minutes hearing nothing but echoes. After a few minutes they were able to find his approximate location. It took the team quite some time to tie together every single tire tube they had in order to make a rope that they hoped would reach him. After a great deal of time their 75 meter "rope" reached Van Est and he was able to use the tires to rig together a hoist which he put around his chest under both arms.
Helped by spectators and his manager, he managed to get back to the road. Van Est wanted to continue, but was persuaded to go to the hospital because he had just crashed down a 200 foot ravine.
At home, Van Est's fame grew even more when Belgian watchmaker
Pontiac
, which had supplied watches to the Dutch team in the Tour de France, started an advertising campaign "Seventy meters deep I dropped, my heart stood still but my Pontiac never stopped".
[5]
Later in his career, Van Est twice won the
Ronde van Nederland
, wore the yellow jersey again in
1955
and
1958
, placed 8th in
1957
and won two more stages. Also, he won Bordeaux-Paris two more times, two national road titles, four national titles in the individual pursuit on the track, as well as three medals in the pursuit at the World Championships.
Nevertheless, he remained most famous for the two days in the 1951 Tour de France. To remember this event, a monument was placed on the mountain 50 years after the event, on 17 July 2001.
Wim van Est died in his hometown
Sint Willebrord
. His brothers Kees, Toon, Leen and
Nico
were also professional cyclists.
[2]
His brother
Piet
was also a pro cyclist who rode in several Tours and won a stage in the
1961 Giro
.

Hugh de Morville
(died 1162) of
Appleby
in
Westmorland
, England, hereditary
Constable of Scotland
, was a
Norman
knight who made his fortune in the service of
David FitzMalcolm
(d.1153),
Prince of the Cumbrians
, later
King of Scotland
.
Origins
[
edit
]
Hugh came from
Morville
in the
Cotentin Peninsula
, in northern France.  His parentage is unclear.  According to
Barrow
his father was probably Richard de Morville who in the early twelfth century witnessed charters made by Richard de Redvers relating to
Montebourg
and the church of St. Mary in the castle of
Néhou
,
[1]
but though
Keats-Rohan
gives that man other possible sons, she does not similarly associate Hugh with Richard.
[2]
In service of David of Scotland
[
edit
]
Prince
David of Scotland
held Cotentin in northern France, given to him by King
Henry I of England
some time after 1106. Soon after, Hugh de Morville joined David's small military retinue in France. In 1113, following his marriage, Prince David was made
Earl of Huntingdon and Northampton
, and also became Prince of the Cumbrians, having forced his brother King
Alexander I
to hand over territory in southern Scotland
[3]
David achieved this with the help of his French followers
[4]
David endowed Hugh with the estates of
Bozeat
and
Whissendine
, within his
Huntingdon earldom
[5]
as his wife's dowery.
[6]
During David's conquest of northern England after 1136, Hugh was also given the lordship of
Appleby
, essentially northern
Westmorland
.
[7]
These lands later formed the
feudal barony of Appleby
.
[8]
After the death of
Edward
,
Constable of Scotland
, almost certainly in 1138 at the
Battle of the Standard
, Hugh was awarded that office.
[9]
In addition "he obtained land and lordships which placed him in the very first rank of the Anglo-Norman nobility in Scotland. These comprised the Lordship of the Regality of Lauderdale, together with detached estates at Saltoun,
Haddingtonshire
, Nenthorn and Newton Don,
Berwickshire
, at Dryburgh on the Tweed opposite Old
Melrose
, and probably also at Heriot in
Midlothian
.  In the west of Scotland he was given the whole of the Lordship of Cunningham, the northernmost third of Ayrshire. Lauderdale, with a castle at
Lauder
, was held, it seems, for six knights' service; Cunningham possibly for two, with a castle at Irvine."
[10]
In 1316-20 Cunningham was granted to Robert Stewart for three knight's service.
[11]
In 1150 Hugh made a further mark on the history of southern Scotland by founding
Dryburgh Abbey
for
Premonstratensian
canons regular,
[12]
where he died as a canon in 1162.
[13]
Marriage and children
[
edit
]
Hugh married Beatrice de Beauchamp, the heiress of the manor of
Houghton Conquest
in
Bedfordshire
.
[14]
She is presumed
[
citation needed
]
to be a daughter of Robert de Beauchamp (died pre-1130) (son of Hugh de Beauchamp).
[
citation needed
]
By Beatrice he had at least two sons and two daughters, including:
[5]
Hugh de Morville, Lord of Westmorland
(died c. 1202), who inherited his father's estates in the north of England. He was a principal player in the 1170 murder of
Thomas Becket
,
Archbishop of Canterbury
.
[5]
He subsequently fell out of favour with King
Henry II
who in 1174 confiscated his Lordship of Westmorland (which he had inherited from his father who had received it from
David I
) and re-granted it to his sister, Maud de Morville, wife of William de
Vieuxpont
.
[5]
Richard de Morville
, possibly the second son, who inherited his father's Scottish estates and lands in the
Honour of Huntingdon
. He also succeeded to the hereditary office of Constable of Scotland.
[5]
Simon de Moreville (d. 1167), another possible son.
[15]
He was seated at
Kirkoswald, Cumbria
, ward of Leath,
Cumberland
, and married Ada de Engaine, heiress of the
Feudal barony of Burgh by Sands
, Cumberland.
Ada de Morville, who at some time before 1157, married Roger Bertram, lord of Mitford, Northumberland.
[5]
Grace de Morville, another possible daughter,
[
citation needed
]
wife of the Cumbrian magnate
Sir Hubert de Vaux
, of
Gilsland
.
Death and burial
[
edit
]
Hugh eventually retired as a canon to his foundation at
Dryburgh Abbey
, where he soon died in  1162.
[13]
An ancient memorial to him in the south wall is said to mark his burial-place.

Vasilissis Sofias Avenue
Vasilissis Sofias Avenue
(
Greek
:
Λεωφόρος Βασιλίσσης Σοφίας
) is a major avenue in the east side of the center of
Athens
, the
Greek
capital.  The avenue was originally part of the
Kifisias Avenue
. The part from
Syntagma Square
to the intersection with
Alexandras Avenue
was renamed after
Queen Sophia
, the consort of
King Constantine I
. The avenue begins at the intersections of
Amalias Avenue
and
Panepistimiou Street
and ends by
Alexandras
,
Kifissias
and
Mesogeion Avenues
as well as
Feidippou Street
, with a total length of approximately 3 km. A section of the avenue is part of the old
GR-1
, and a branch of
GR-54
.

As many historical buildings and landmarks are located on the avenue, such as the
Old Royal Palace
(today housing the
Greek Parliament
) and the
National Gardens of Athens
, the mansions of very important Greeks and foreigners (today most of them housing embassies and museums) (e.g. the residence of the Greek Prime Minister
Eleutherios Venizelos
-now part of the British embassy, the mansion of
Sophie de Marbois-Lebrun, Duchess of Plaisance
-now the
Byzantine and Christian Museum
, the mansion of
business magnate
and tycoon Othon Stathatos-today part of the
Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art
), Vasilissis Sofias Avenue is one of the most chic and prestigious streets in the Greek capital. Because of the very high price of land on this street, most of the buildings seen on Vasilissis Sofias Avenue were mainly built in the 1950s-1960s, but others built in the beginnings of the 20th century are also commonly seen. Except from residences, medical doctors' private practices, banks, museums, embassies and high-end hotels are common on this historical street.
The westbound lanes turn into Amalias Avenue and Panepistimiou Street, and the northbound of Amalias turns into  Vasileias Sofias Avenue and Panepistimiou Street ;  there is no traffic flow from the eastbound of Panepistimiou Street as it forms a one-way route westbound, and since the 2000s transit traffic has been excluded. Three
Athens Metro
stations (Line 3) are on, or near, Vassilissis Sofias Avenue:
Syntagma
,
Evangelismos
,
Megaro Moussikis
(the Evangelismos station is on the avenue).
History
[
edit
]
The avenue was first paved in the 20th century and added trolley lanes by the ends of the avenue,  with  neo-classical buildings also taking shape by the avenue.  After
World War II
and the
Greek Civil War
, it added modern eight-to-ten storey buildings in most of the intersection (mainly to the north)  with traffic  and street lights  installed.  Today's Vassilissis Sofias Avenue has,  on its west side, four lanes westbound and two lanes eastbound,  while beyond, the rest of the avenue takes in three lanes, including a bus lane and  intersection by Vasileos Konstantinou Avenue and Vasileos Alexandrou Street.

Italian painter (1658-1725)
Giovanni Maria Ciocchi
[1]
(
Florence
, 23 March 1658 - Florence, 1725) was an Italian painter and art critic, active during the
Baroque
period. He was born into a family of artists, and it is not clear if he is related to
Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte
(1487 - 1555) from
Perugia
, who became Pope
Julius III
. it is not clear that Giovanni Maria is related to the 16th century painter
Ulisse Ciocchi
.
Ceiling of Santa Maria degli Angiolini, Florence.
Biography
[
edit
]
Giovanni Maria, was the second son of Clemente, a sculptor in Florence.  His older brother Michele, was a building engineer, and Michele's son,
Giovanni Filippo
(died 1770), was an architect.
[2]
Giovanni Maria trained under his brother-in-law,
Pier Dandini
. In the Florentine tradition, who gave great weight to prior masters, Giovanni was engaged in making copies of works in the ducal courts of Italy, including travels to Venice, Parma, Modena, Rome, and Naples.
Francesco Maria Gabburri
said of Giovanni Maria that during his travels to the latter two cities, he did also create works of his own design. In 1705, Giovanni Maria became a teacher at the
Academy of the Art of Design
of Florence.
He completed the frescoes in the ceiling of the church of
Santa Maria degli Angiolini, Florence
, depicting
St Michael Archangel in Glory
.  He also painted two lunettes in the library of the convent of the
Annunziata
. He painted altarpieces for
Santa Maria in Campo
; for
San Jacopo sopr'Arno
, in the latter depicting a
Christ appearing to St Anthony Abbot
(circa 1709); and for the church of
Santa Lucia dei Magnoli
, depicting the
Martyrdom of the Santa Lucia
(circa 1712-15).
[3]
He also frescoed stanza in the
Palazzo Mansi
of Lucca.
[4]
Late in life, Giovanni Maria went blind, and he wrote a book which discussed his ideas about art.
La Pittura in Parnaso
[5]
Published posthumously in 1725, the work was dedicated to Marquis Neri Guadagni. This work like his painting, and much of contemporary Florentine art, was an overly-erudite exercise in cultural analysis.

François Ciccolini
(born 3 June 1962)
[1]
is a French
football
manager
and former player.
Career
[
edit
]
Born in
Cozzano
,
Corsica
, Ciccolini spent most of his playing career as a
forward
on the island, with
SC Bastia
and
Gazélec Ajaccio
. In his first managerial job with
AS Porto-Vecchio
, he took them to the last 32 of the
1999-2000
Coupe de France
before losing to
Bordeaux
.
[2]
He then moved into the ranks of Bastia, becoming manager in 2004 and being sacked in April 2005 when the team was 19th in
Ligue 1
.
[3]
Ciccolini returned to management in 2008 at
Red Star F.C.
, and was dismissed the following March with the team in danger of relegation.
[4]
After working in the youth teams of
AS Monaco FC
, he took the job at
Neuchâtel Xamax FCS
in June 2011.
[5]
Following defeat in the first two games of the
Swiss Super League
season, he was dismissed in July and replaced by
Joaquín Caparrós
.
[6]
In October 2014, Ciccolini was hired at
JS Kabylie
in Algeria but left two months later to rejoin Bastia.
[7]
He served as assistant to
Ghislain Printant
before taking the job outright in January 2016, with the team three points outside the relegation zone.
[8]
They finished the season in 10th, but by the end of February 2017 they were 19th and he was dismissed and replaced by
Rui Almeida
.
[9]
Ciccolini's next job was at
Stade Lavallois
in the third-tier
Championnat National
. Early on in his tenure in August 2018, he made a threat of physical violence towards a
Radio France
journalist, and earned a five-month ban with the last two suspended.
[10]
The following February, he made an obscene gesture towards fans at
JA Drancy
,
[11]
and left his job by mutual consent days later.
[12]
In June 2019, Ciccolini returned to Gazélec on a two-year deal as manager, after the team's play-off relegation from
Ligue 2
.
[13]
In May 2020 he was sacked, following the team's relegation to
Championnat National 2
.
[14]
In November 2020, Ciccolini was appointed at
USM Alger
back in Algeria. He was dismissed after his debut, a 2-1 loss to
CR Belouizdad
in the
Super Cup
, for "disrespecting government officials" by refusing to take a runners-up medal from
prime minister
Abdelaziz Djerad
.

Calculation commonly applied to engines and mobile power sources

Power-to-weight ratio
(
PWR
, also called
specific power
, or
power-to-mass ratio
) is a calculation commonly applied to
engines
and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a
vehicle
as a whole, with the
engine's power output
being divided by the weight (or
mass
) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle's size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance.
The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle's performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle.
Power-to-weight (specific power)
[
edit
]
The power-to-weight ratio (specific power) formula for an engine (power plant) is the
power
generated by the engine divided by the mass.
Weight
in this context is a colloquial term for
mass
. To see this, note that what an engineer means by the "power to weight ratio" of an electric motor is not infinite in a zero gravity environment.
A typical turbocharged V8 diesel engine might have an engine power of 250 kW (340 hp) and a mass of 380 kg (840 lb),
[1]
giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 0.65 kW/kg (0.40 hp/lb).
Examples of high power-to-weight ratios can often be found in turbines. This is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds. For example, the
Space Shuttle
's main engines used
turbopumps
(machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and
liquid hydrogen
) into the engine's combustion chamber. The original liquid hydrogen turbopump is similar in size to an automobile engine (weighing approximately 352 kilograms (775 lb)) and produces 72,000 hp (54 MW)
[2]
for a power-to-weight ratio of 153 kW/kg (93 hp/lb).
Physical interpretation
[
edit
]
In
classical mechanics
, instantaneous
power
is the limiting value of the average work done per unit time as the time interval Δ
t
approaches zero (i.e. the
derivative
with respect to time of the work done).
P

{\displaystyle P=\lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}{\tfrac {\Delta W(t)}{\Delta t}}=\lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}P_{\mathrm {avg} }={\frac {d}{dt}}W(t)\,}
The typically used metric unit of the power-to-weight ratio is
W
kg
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {\text{W}}{\text{kg}}}\;}
which equals
m
2
s
3
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {{\text{m}}^{2}}{{\text{s}}^{3}}}\;}
. This fact allows one to express the power-to-weight ratio purely by
SI base units
. A vehicle's power-to-weight ratio equals its acceleration times its velocity; so at twice the velocity, it experiences half the acceleration, all else being equal.
Propulsive power
[
edit
]
If the work to be done is
rectilinear
motion of a body with constant
mass
m
{\displaystyle m\;}
, whose
center of mass
is to be accelerated along a (possibly non-straight) to a speed
|
v
(
t
)
|
{\displaystyle |\mathbf {v} (t)|\;}
and angle
ϕ
{\displaystyle \phi \;}
with respect to the centre and
radial
of a
gravitational field
by an onboard
powerplant
, then the associated
kinetic energy
is
E
K
=

2
m
|
v
(
t
)
|
2
{\displaystyle E_{K}={\tfrac {1}{2}}m|\mathbf {v} (t)|^{2}}
where:
m
{\displaystyle m\;}
is mass of the body
|
v
(
t
)
|
{\displaystyle |\mathbf {v} (t)|\;}
is speed of the
center of mass
of the body, changing with time.
The
work-energy principle
states that the work done to the object over a period of time is equal to the difference in its total energy over that period of time, so the rate at which work is done is equal to the rate of change of the kinetic energy (in the absence of potential energy changes).
The work done from time
t
to time
t
+ Δ
t
along the path
C
is defined as the
line integral

{\displaystyle \int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\int _{t}^{t+\Delta t}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} (t)dt}

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (t)\cdot \mathbf {v} (t)=m\mathbf {a} (t)\cdot \mathbf {v} (t)=\mathbf {\tau } (t)\cdot \mathbf {\omega } (t)}
.
where:
a

d
t
v
(

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} (t)={\frac {d}{dt}}\mathbf {v} (t)\;}
is acceleration of the
center of mass
of the body, changing with time.
F
(
t
)
{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (t)\;}
is linear force - or thrust - applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
v
(
t
)
{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)\;}
is
velocity
of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
τ
(
t
)
{\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } (t)\;}
is
torque
applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
ω
(
t
)
{\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } (t)\;}
is
angular velocity
of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
In
propulsion
, power is only delivered if the powerplant is in motion, and is transmitted to cause the body to be in motion. It is typically assumed here that mechanical transmission allows the powerplant to operate at peak output power. This assumption allows engine tuning to trade
power band
width and engine mass for transmission complexity and mass.
Electric motors
do not suffer from this tradeoff, instead trading their high
torque
for
traction
at low speed. The
power advantage
or power-to-weight ratio is then
P-to-W
=

a

|
|
v
(

{\displaystyle {\mbox{P-to-W}}=|\mathbf {a} (t)||\mathbf {v} (t)|\;}
where:
|
v
(
t
)
|
{\displaystyle |\mathbf {v} (t)|\;}
is linear speed of the
center of mass
of the body.
Engine power
[
edit
]
The useful power of an engine with shaft power output can be calculated using a
dynamometer
to measure
torque
and
rotational speed
, with maximum power reached when torque multiplied by rotational speed is a maximum. For jet engines the useful power is equal to the flight speed of the aircraft multiplied by the force, known as net thrust, required to make it go at that speed. It is used when calculating
propulsive efficiency
.

Thermal energy is made up from

energy.
Heat engines
are able to convert thermal energy in the form of a temperature gradient between a hot source and a cold sink into other desirable
mechanical work
.
Heat pumps
take
mechanical work
to regenerate thermal energy in a temperature gradient. Standard definitions should be used when interpreting how the propulsive power of a jet or rocket engine is transferred to its vehicle.

Electrochemical (galvanic) and electrostatic cell systems

(Closed cell) batteries
[
edit
]
All electrochemical cell batteries deliver a changing voltage as their chemistry changes from "charged" to "discharged". A nominal output voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage falls to the cutoff voltage when the battery becomes "discharged". The nominal output voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is "charged". The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single charge cycle is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered at the point of "discharge" is also reduced.
Battery discharge profiles are often described in terms of a factor of
battery capacity
. For example, a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current - and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio - but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding energy-to-weight ratio and cell temperature. This relationship is known as
Peukert's law
.

Electrostatic, electrolytic and electrochemical capacitors
[
edit
]
Capacitors
store electric charge onto two electrodes separated by an electric field semi-insulating (
dielectric
) medium. Electrostatic capacitors feature planar electrodes onto which electric charge accumulates.
Electrolytic capacitors
use a liquid electrolyte as one of the electrodes and the
electric double layer effect
upon the surface of the dielectric-electrolyte boundary to increase the amount of charge stored per unit volume.
Electric double-layer capacitors
extend both electrodes with a
nanoporous
material such as
activated carbon
to significantly increase the surface area upon which electric charge can accumulate, reducing the dielectric medium to nanopores and a very thin high
permittivity
separator.
While capacitors tend not to be as temperature sensitive as batteries, they are significantly capacity constrained and without the strength of chemical bonds suffer from self-discharge. Power-to-weight ratio of capacitors is usually higher than batteries because charge transport units within the cell are smaller (electrons rather than ions), however energy-to-weight ratio is conversely usually lower.

Fuel cell stacks and flow cell batteries
[
edit
]
Fuel cells
and
flow cells
, although perhaps using similar chemistry to batteries, do not contain the energy storage medium or
fuel
. With a continuous flow of fuel and oxidant, available fuel cells and flow cells continue to convert the energy storage medium into electric energy and waste products. Fuel cells distinctly contain a fixed electrolyte whereas flow cells also require a continuous flow of electrolyte. Flow cells typically have the fuel dissolved in the electrolyte.

Power-to-weight ratios for vehicles are usually calculated using
curb weight
(for cars) or wet weight (for motorcycles), that is, excluding weight of the driver and any cargo. This could be slightly misleading, especially with regard to motorcycles, where the driver might weigh 1/3 to 1/2 as much as the vehicle itself. In the sport of competitive cycling athlete's performance is increasingly being expressed in
VAMs
and thus as a power-to-weight ratio in W/kg. This can be measured through the use of a bicycle powermeter or calculated from measuring incline of a road climb and the rider's time to ascend it.

Locomotives
[
edit
]
A
locomotive
generally must be heavy in order to develop enough
adhesion on the rails
to start a train. As the
coefficient of friction
between steel wheels and rails seldom exceeds 0.25 in most cases, improving a locomotive's power-to-weight ratio is often counterproductive. However, the choice of power transmission system, such as
variable-frequency drive
versus
direct current drive
, may support a higher power-to-weight ratio by better managing propulsion power.

Utility and practical vehicles
[
edit
]
Most vehicles are designed to meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements. Vehicle designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort, cargo space,
fuel economy
,
emissions control
,
energy security
and endurance.
Reduced drag
and
lower rolling resistance
in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the (zero cargo) power-to-weight ratio. This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle. Energy security considerations can trade off power (typically decreased) and weight (typically increased), and therefore power-to-weight ratio, for
fuel flexibility
or
drive-train hybridisation
. Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as
hot hatches
and
sports-utility vehicles
reconfigure power (typically increased) and weight to provide the perception of
sports car
like performance or for other
psychological benefit
.

Power-to-weight ratio is important in cycling, since it determines acceleration and the speed during
hill climbs
. Since a cyclist's power-to-weight output decreases with fatigue, it is normally discussed with relation to the length of time that he or she maintains that power. A professional cyclist can produce over 20 W/kg (0.012 hp/lb) as a 5-second maximum.

Muintir na Tíre
, a national
rural community development
organisation.
Biography
[
edit
]
Hayes was born in a
Land League
hut at
Murroe
, Co
Limerick
to a family languishing in poverty. One of ten siblings, seven of Hayes' brothers and sisters died of malnutrition and disease over a twelve-year period. The family had been evicted from
Lord Cloncurry
's estate in 1872 for non-payment of rent, forcing them into destitution. The family returned to the estate in 1894.
[1]
Hayes was educated by the
Jesuits
at
Crescent College
, Limerick and thereafter studied for the priesthood in
St. Patrick's College, Thurles
. In 1907 he went to the
Irish College in Paris
where he was ordained in 1913. Hayes enjoy this time in France greatly, a period highlighted by the beatification of St Joan of Arc in 1909. From 1915 to 1924 he worked in
Liverpool
before returning to Ireland to serve as
curate
in
Castleiney
and later in
Tipperary
Town. Previous to 1916, Hayes was a supporter of the
Irish Volunteers
, and his brother Mick would become a leading member of the Limerick
Irish Republican Army
, however, he effectively missed the
Irish revolutionary period
as he was sent to work in Liverpool between 1915 and 1924.
[1]
During the 1920s Hayes became an admirer of
Benito Mussolini
, with whom he was granted an audience during a visit to Rome in 1930.
[2]
Hayes was intrigued by
corporatism
and came to believe it could uplift rural communities. Similarly, Hayes was influenced by continental movements such as the Belgian
Boerenbond
league, which encouraged rural inhabitants to form
cooperatives
.
[1]
Hayes came to national prominence with the foundation of Muintir na Tíre in 1931, a rural development organisation which had core principles of neighbourliness,
self-help
and
self-sufficiency
. It was to act as a rural self-help group based on collective parish organisation with a strong emphasis on the teaching of the papal encyclicals
Rerum Novarum
(1891) and
Quadragesimo Anno
(1931). Hayes was successfully able to draw on the power of the media, Irish newspapers and radio, to promote Muintir na Tíre and quickly became a figure of national prominence in doing so. In promoting and developing Muintir na Tíre Hayes resisted calls in some quarters to limit the membership to Catholics, remarking "this country is becoming so Catholic it forgets to be Christian". Nonetheless, under Hayes's leadership, there was eventually an overlap in membership between Muintir na Tíre and the Catholic fraternal organisation the
Knights of Columbanus
.
[1]
He was appointed
parish priest
of
Bansha
&
Kilmoyler
in
County Tipperary
in 1946. Due largely to his endeavours, a factory - Bansha Rural Industries - was started and enjoyed some success producing
preserves
for the Irish home market. Bansha was to the forefront in developing many Muintir na Tíre initiatives and for a time in the 1950s enjoyed the soubriquet of The Model Parish.
A lifelong
teetotaller
, a highlight of Hayes' career was his address to the
Pioneer Total Abstinence Association
in
Croke Park
in June 1949 to celebrate their 50th year of operation. The event was the largest Catholic gathering in Dublin since the
Eucharistic Congress of 1932
.
[1]
He spearheaded many initiatives including
rural electrification
, the "Parish Plan for Agriculture", and the setting up of small industry in rural areas in an attempt to stop
emigration
. He was later made a
canon
of his
cathedral chapter
. Hayes died in February, 1957 in a Tipperary nursing home following a minor operation.
[1]
His funeral in Bansha was a national occasion, attended by leaders of Church and State.
[3]
His grave is at the rear of the Church of the Annunciation, Bansha. He was later
commemorated on an Irish postage stamp
.

Distinct territorial body or political entity
Not to be confused with
County
.
For countryside, see
Rural area
. For other uses, see
Country (disambiguation)
.
The marked territories on this global map are mostly of countries which are
sovereign states
with full international recognition (brackets denote the country of a marked territory that is not a sovereign state). Some territories are countries in their own right but are
not recognized as such
(e.g.
Taiwan
), and some few marked territories are
disputed
about which country they belong to (e.g.
Kashmir
) or if they are countries in their own right (e.g.
Western Sahara
(territory) or
the state known by the same name
).
A
country
is a distinct part of the
world
, such as a
state
,
nation
, or other
political entity
. It may be a
sovereign state
or make up one part of a larger state.
[1]
For example, the country of
Japan
is an independent, sovereign state, while the country of
Wales
is a component of a multi-part sovereign state, the
United Kingdom
. A country may be a
historically sovereign
area (such as
Korea
), a currently sovereign territory with a unified
government
(such as
Senegal
), or a non-sovereign geographic region associated with certain distinct political, ethnic, or cultural characteristics (such as the
Basque Country
).
The definition and usage of the word "country" is flexible and has changed over time.
The Economist
wrote in 2010 that "any attempt to find a clear definition of a country soon runs into a thicket of exceptions and anomalies."
[2]
Most sovereign states, but not all countries, are members of the
United Nations
. Countries are often associated with symbols such as flags or anthems; they may also evoke strong feelings of devotion and patriotism in their populations.
The largest country by area is
Russia
, while the smallest is the
microstate
Vatican City
. The most populous is
India
; Vatican City is the least populous.
Etymology
The word
country
comes from
Old French
contrée
, which derives from
Vulgar Latin
(
terra
)
contrata
("(land) lying opposite"; "(land) spread before"), derived from
contra
("against, opposite"). It most likely entered the English language after the
Franco-Norman invasion
during the 11th century.
[3]

Definition of a country
In English
In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the
indefinite article
- "a country" - is now frequently applied as a synonym for a state or a former sovereign state. It may also be used as a synonym for "nation". Taking as examples
Canada
,
Sri Lanka
, and
Yugoslavia
, cultural anthropologist
Clifford Geertz
wrote in 1997 that "it is clear that the relationships between 'country' and 'nation' are so different from one [place] to the next as to be impossible to fold into a dichotomous opposition as they are into a promiscuous fusion."
[4]
Areas much smaller than a political state may be referred to as countries, such as the
West Country
in England, "big sky country" (used in various contexts of the
American West
), "coal country" (used to describe
coal-mining regions
in several sovereign states) and many other terms.
[5]
[
better source needed
]
The word "country" is also used for the sense of
native sovereign territory
, such as the widespread use of
Indian country
in the United States.
[6]
The term "country" in English may also be wielded to describe
rural areas
, or used in the form "countryside."
Raymond Williams
, a Welsh scholar, wrote in 1975:
[7]
'Country' and 'city' are very powerful words, and this is not surprising when we remember how much they seem to stand for in the experience of human communities. In English, 'country' is both a nation and a part of a 'land'; 'the country' can be the whole society or its rural area. In the long history of human settlements, this connection between the land from which directly or indirectly we all get our living and the achievements of human society has been deeply known.
The unclear definition of "country" in modern English was further commented upon by philosopher Simon Keller:
[8]
Often, a country is presumed to be identical with a collection of citizens. Sometimes, people say that a country is a project, or an idea, or an ideal. Occasionally, philosophers entertain more metaphysically ambitious pictures, suggesting that a country is an organic entity with its own independent life and character, or that a country is an autonomous agent, just like you or me. Such claims are rarely explained or defended, however, and it is not clear how they should be assessed. We attribute so many different kinds of properties to countries, speaking as though a country can feature wheat fields waving or be girt by sea, can have a founding date and be democratic and free, can be English speaking, culturally diverse, war torn or Islamic.

New Waves In Political Philosophy
, "Making Nonsense of Loyalty to Country", page 96
Melissa Lucashenko
, an
Aboriginal Australian
writer, expressed the difficulty of defining "country" in a 2005 essay, "Unsettlement":
[9]
...What is this thing country? What does country
mean? ... I spoke with others who said country meant Home, but who added the caveat that Home resided in people rather than places - a kind of portable Country... I tried to tease out some ways in which non-Indigenous people have understood country. I made categories: Country as Economy. Country as Geography. Country as Society. Country as Myth. Country as History. For all that I walked, slept, breathed and dreamed Country, the language still would not come.
In other languages
The equivalent terms in various
Romance languages
(e.g. the French
pays
) have not carried the process of being identified with sovereign political states as far as the English
country
. These terms are derived from the Roman term
pagus
, which continued to be used in the Middle Ages for small geographical areas similar to the size of English counties.
[

]
In many
European countries
, the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the
German
Bundesländer
, as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many "
pays
" that are officially recognized at some level and are either
natural regions
, like the
Pays de Bray
, or reflect old political or economic entities, like the
Pays de la Loire
.
[

A version of "country" can be found in modern French as
contrée
, derived from the Old French word
cuntrée
,
[5]
[
better source needed
]
that is used similarly to the word
pays
to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian
contrada
is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a
ward
or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

Name

List of country-name etymologies
A number of non-sovereign entities nevertheless have country codes, such as PF (
French Polynesia
) and TK (
Tokelau
)
Most countries have a long name and a short name. The long name is typically used in formal contexts and often describes the country's form of government. The short name is the country's common name by which it is typically identified.
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[

The names of most countries are derived from a feature of the land, the name of a historical tribe or person, or a directional description.
[14]
[

The
International Organization for Standardization
maintains a
list of country codes
as part of
ISO 3166
to designate each country with a two-letter
country code
.
[15]
The name of a country can hold cultural and diplomatic significance.
Upper Volta
changed its name to
Burkina Faso
to reflect the end of French colonization, and the name of
North Macedonia
was
disputed
for years due to a conflict with the similarly named
Macedonia
region in
Greece
.
[16]
Flags
Originally, flags representing a country would generally be the personal flag of its rulers; however, over time, the practice of using personal banners as flags of places was abandoned in favor of flags that had some significance to the nation, often its patron saint. Early examples of these were the
maritime republics
such as
Genoa
which could be said to have a national flag as early as the 12th century.
[17]
However, these were still mostly used in the context of marine identification.
[
citation needed
]
Although some flags date back earlier, widespread use of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of the idea of the
nation state
at the end of the 18th century and particularly are a product of the
Age of Revolution
. Revolutions such as those in
France
and
America
called for people to begin thinking of themselves as
citizens
as opposed to
subjects
under a king, and thus necessitated flags that represented the collective citizenry, not just the power and right of a ruling family.
[18]
[19]
With
nationalism
becoming common across Europe in the 19th century, national flags came to represent most of the states of Europe.
[18]
Flags also began fostering a sense of unity between different peoples, such as the
Union Jack
representing a union between
England
and
Scotland
, or began to represent unity between nations in a perceived shared struggle, for example, the
Pan-Slavic colors
or later
Pan-Arab colors
.
[20]
As Europeans
colonized
significant portions of the world, they exported ideas of nationhood and national symbols, including flags, with the adoption of a flag becoming seen as integral to the
nation-building
process.
[21]
Political change, social reform, and revolutions combined with a growing sense of nationhood among ordinary people in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the birth of new nations and flags around the globe.
[22]
With so many flags being created, interest in these designs began to develop and the study of flags,
vexillology
, at both professional and amateur levels, emerged. After World War II, Western vexillology went through a phase of rapid development, with many research facilities and publications being established.
[23]
National anthems
A national anthem is a
patriotic
musical composition
symbolizing and evoking eulogies of the history and traditions of a country or nation.
[24]
Though the custom of an officially adopted national anthem became popular only in the 19th century, some national anthems predate this period, often existing as patriotic songs long before designation as national anthem.
[
citation needed
]
Several countries remain without an official national anthem. In these cases, there are established
de facto
anthems played at sporting events or diplomatic receptions. These include the United Kingdom ("
God Save the King
") and Sweden (
Du gamla, Du fria
). Some sovereign states that are made up of multiple countries or constituencies have associated musical compositions for each of them (such as with the
United Kingdom
,
Russia
, and the former
Soviet Union
). These are sometimes referred to as national anthems even though they are not sovereign states (for example, "
Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau
" is used for Wales, part of the United Kingdom).

List of sovereign states
When referring to a specific polity, the term "country" may refer to a sovereign state, a constituent country, or a
dependent territory
. A sovereign state is a
political entity
that has supreme legitimate authority over a part of the world.
[25]
There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world since several states have disputed sovereignty status, and a number of non-sovereign entities are commonly called countries.
By one application of the
declarative theory of statehood
and
constitutive theory of statehood
,
[26]
[

]
there are
206 sovereign states
; of which 193 are members of the UN, two have observer status at the
United Nations General Assembly
(UNGA) (the
Holy See
and
Palestine
), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UNGA.
[27]
[28]
[

Some countries, such as
Taiwan
and the
Sahrawi Republic
, have disputed sovereignty status. Some sovereign states are unions of separate polities, each of which may also be considered a country in its own right, called constituent countries. The
Danish Realm
consists of
Denmark proper
, the
Faroe Islands
, and
Greenland
.
[29]
The
Kingdom of the Netherlands
consists of the
Netherlands proper
,
Aruba

The
United Kingdom
consists of

Dependent territories are the territories of a sovereign state that are outside of its proper territory. These include the
overseas territories of New Zealand
, the
dependencies of Norway
, the
British Overseas Territories
and
Crown Dependencies
, the
territories of the United States
, the
external territories of Australia
, the
special administrative regions of China
, the autonomous regions of the Danish Realm,
Åland
,

A positive emotional connection to a country a person belongs to is called
patriotism
. Patriotism is a sense of love for, devotion to, and sense of attachment to one's country. This attachment can be a combination of many different feelings, and language relating to one's homeland, including ethnic, cultural, political, or historical aspects. It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to
nationalism
, mostly
civic nationalism
and sometimes
cultural nationalism
.

Economy
Several organizations seek to identify trends to produce economy country classifications. Countries are often distinguished as
developing countries
or
developed countries
.

The
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs
annually produces the
World Economic Situation and Prospects Report
classifies states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classifies country development based on per capita
gross national income
(GNI). The UN identifies subgroups within broad categories based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies like Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

The
World Bank
also classifies countries based on GNI per capita. The
World Bank Atlas method
classifies countries as low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, or high-income economies. For the 2020 fiscal year, the World Bank defines low-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower-middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper-middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.
[41]
It also identifies regional trends. The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on its operational policies. The three categories include
International Development Association
(IDA) countries,
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.

William Hardie (disambiguation)
.
William Ross Hardie
(6 January 1862 - 3 May 1916) was a
Scottish
classical scholar, Professor of Humanity at
Edinburgh University
from 1895 until his death.
Early life
[
edit
]
Hardie was born in
Edinburgh
in 1862 and educated there at
Circus Place School
and Edinburgh University, where he graduated with an
undergraduate Master of Arts
(MA hons) degree in 1880, and then at
Balliol College, Oxford
, where he graduated BA and later MA.
[1]
In 1882 he was awarded both the
Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse
and the
Gaisford Prize for Greek Prose
, among other distinctions, and was considered the "most brilliant undergraduate classicist of his generation".
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
Elected to a fellowship at Balliol in 1884, he spent a year abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy, and returned to his college, staying there as Fellow and Tutor at Balliol from 1884 to 1895 and also serving as the university's Junior Proctor in 1893-1894.
At Balliol, he taught a form of
Greek
that was "simple, pronounceable, and intelligible to the ear", writing to
John Stuart Blackie
"I always endeavour to make the accent audible in pronouncing Greek. I quote, read, or recite Greek as much as possible, and I frequently teach composition orally, by... choosing by chance a piece of English and working out a version of it by common suggestion and discussion".
[3]
In 1895, he was appointed Professor of Humanity at Edinburgh University.
[1]
[4]
He died on 3 May 1916 after suffering a severe attack of
influenza
in January 1916.
[1]
Sons
[
edit
]
Hardie was the father of
William Francis Ross Hardie
(1902-1990) and
Colin Graham Hardie
(1906-1998), both also classical scholars.  His elder son, W. F. R. (Frank) Hardie, was President of
Corpus Christi College, Oxford
, from 1950 to 1969.

The
Elapoidea
are a
superfamily
of
snakes
in the clade
Colubroides
, traditionally comprising the families
Lamprophiidae
and
Elapidae
. Advanced genomic sequence studies, however, have found lamprophiids to be
paraphyletic
in respect to elapids, and anywhere between four and nine families are now recognized.
[5]
[6]
[7]
Taxonomy
[
edit
]
In describing the subfamily
Cyclocorinae
, Weinell et al. (2017) suggested some or all subfamilies of Lamprophiidae should be reevaluated at full family status as a way to prevent the alternative, which is classifying them as elapids.
[6]
This was followed in later studies such as Zaher
et al.
(2019).
[8]
Alternatively, Das
et al.
(2023) classified Cyclocoridae, Elapidae,
Micrelapidae
, and Lamprophiidae as distinct families, with all other families being subfamilies of Lamprophiidae; however, the Reptile Database still retains these as distinct families.
[9]
[7]
Molecular studies suggest a rapid radiation of this superfamily within the
Eocene
, with all families diverging from one another by the end of the epoch. Although studies have found conflicting results, Cyclocoridae is generally considered the most basal member of the superfamily.
[7]

High Point Regional High School
is a
comprehensive
four-year
public
high school
located in
Wantage Township
, in the
U.S. state
of
New Jersey
(with a
Sussex
postal address),
[5]
which is the sole high school in its
school district
.
The district educates students in
ninth
through
twelfth grades
from municipalities in
Sussex County
, specifically the constituent districts of Wantage Township, Sussex Borough,
Branchville Borough
,
Frankford Township
, and
Lafayette Township
, with students from
Montague Township
attending as part of a
sending/receiving relationship
.
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
The high school was established in 1963 and is located in Wantage Township. The school is accredited by the
New Jersey Department of Education
.
As of the 2021-22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 812 students and 72.8 classroom teachers (on an
FTE
basis), for a
student-teacher ratio
of 11.2:1. There were 90 students (11.1% of enrollment) eligible for

[1]
The district is classified by the
New Jersey Department of Education
as being in
District Factor Group
"DE", the fifth-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common
socioeconomic
characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.
[10]
History
[
edit
]
Prior to the establishment of the regional high school, students from Branchville, Frankford Township and Lafayette Township had attended
Newton High School
as part of
sending/receiving relationships
, while those from Sussex and Wantage Township had attended
Sussex High School
.
[11]
[12]
[13]
Created in 1963 as a district, the school opened in September 1966.
[14]
Starting in September 2014, high school students from
Montague Township School District
began attending High Point Regional High School, as part of a sending/receiving relationship under which incoming ninth graders began attending the High Point district while existing students attended
Port Jervis High School
in
Port Jervis, New York
until they graduated.
[15]
The Montague district began seeking to annul the relationship with High Point Regional and resume sending students to Port Jervis.
[16]
The Montague district chose to switch back to Port Jervis because Port Jervis offered a lower tuition than High Point; High Point charged $16,368 per student to Montague. All six members of the Montague district voted, in October 2019, to switch back to Port Jervis. The High Point district sought to block this request on the grounds it and its students would be financially impacted. The Montague district stated that the districts signed an agreement in 2018 that would allow Montague to leave at will.
[17]
By December 2020 , the districts were in a legal dispute.
[18]
The High Point agreement is scheduled to end in 2024.
[19]
The Montague district began seeking to annul the relationship with High Point Regional and resume sending students to Port Jervis. In February 2018 all seven members of the Montague board approved a symbolic resolution to not renew its ties with High Point. Eric Obernauer of the
New Jersey Herald
stated that the Montague-High Point relationship was "frosty" and "icy".

[18]
The High Point agreement is scheduled to end in 2024.
[21]
By 2021 the new Montague board sought to dismiss lawsuits against High Point. Obernauer stated "dissatisfaction with how the Montague district is being run and legal fees spent trying to resume the longstanding relationship with Port Jervis, coupled with a growing acceptance of the High Point relationship, appear to have changed public sentiment."
[22]
Awards, recognition and rankings
[
edit
]
For the 1997-98 school year, High Point Regional High School received the
National Blue Ribbon Award
from the
United States Department of Education
, the highest honor that an American school can achieve.
[23]
The school was the 142nd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in
New Jersey Monthly
magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology.
[24]
The school had been ranked 88th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 125th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed.
[25]
The magazine ranked the school 157th in 2008 out of 316 schools.
[26]
The school was ranked 151st in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.
[27]
The school was recently ranked first of 53 schools in the state in the "DE"
District Factor Group
by
The Star-Ledger
and second in the DFG by
New Jersey Monthly
magazine.
Schooldigger.com ranked the school 124th out of 389 public high schools statewide in its 2012 rankings (an increase of 7 positions from the 2011 rank) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (88.6%) and language arts literacy (95.2%) components of the
High School Proficiency Assessment
(HSPA).
[28]
From the New Jersey Department of Education's "Violence, Vandalism, and Substance Abuse in the Schools" report for 2012-2013, Patch released a list of the "9 Most Violent School Districts in New Jersey", with High Point Regional High School ranking number 5, preceded by Camden County Vocational School.
[29]
These numbers brought much surprise to both students and parents in the district, considering the school's strong efforts to combat bullying with the "Students Against Being Bullied" organization founded by one of High Point's own students.

[32]
Athletics
[
edit
]
The High Point Wildcats
[3]
compete in the
Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference
a high school athletic conference comprised of public and private schools in
Morris
, Sussex and
Warren
counties, which operates under the auspices of the
New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association
(NJSIAA), the statewide organization for high school sports.
[33]
[34]
Until the NJSIAA's 2009 realignment, the school had participated in the
Sussex County Interscholastic League
, which included public and private high schools located in Sussex County and northern Morris County.
[35]
With 673 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019-20 school year as Group II for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 486 to 758 students in that grade range.
[36]
The football team competes in the American White division of the
North Jersey Super Football Conference
, which includes 112 schools competing in 20 divisions, making it the nation's biggest football-only high school sports league.
[37]
[38]
The school was classified by the NJSIAA as Group II North for football for 2022-2024, which included schools with 478 to 672 students.
[39]
The school participates as the host school / lead agency for joint ice hockey, boys lacrosse and boys / girls swimming teams with
Wallkill Valley Regional High School
. These co-op programs operate under agreements scheduled to expire at the end of the 2023-24 school year.
[40]
[41]
The wrestling team won the North I Group III state sectional championship in 1986-1997, 2001-2003, 2005-2008, 2010 and 2011, and the North II Group II title in 2012-2014 and 2017-2020. The team won the Group III state title in 2008 and 2011, and the Group II title in 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018 and 2020
[42]
The wrestling team won the Group III state wrestling championship in 2008 against
Sayreville War Memorial High School
, marking the school's second team state championship overall in all sports and its first ever in wrestling.
[43]
They had won the SCIL League numerous times, including the last year of its existence in 2009. In 2009, the wrestling team was ruled ineligible to participate in the NJSIAA state tournament, as 65% of its matches had been against teams from New Jersey schools, less than the required 70% threshold.
[44]
High Point captured its first back-to-back Group II championship wins in 2013 and 2014. High Point found themselves down 21-6 after seven bouts in 2013 against
Long Branch High School
and won the title with a four-bout pinning spree before holding on to win by a 33-30 margin.
[45]
The 2014 team defeated
Hanover Park High School
with four consecutive pins to win the Group II title, after trailing 33-10 with four bouts left in the match.
[46]
The field hockey team won the North I Group III state sectional title in 1988, 1996, 1997, 2000 and 2002; the team won the Group III state championship in 1988, defeating
Red Bank Regional High School
in the championship game.
[47]
The team won the North I Group III sectional title in 2002 with a 4-0 shutout against
West Morris Central High School
in the tournament final.
[48]
The softball team won the Group III state championship in 2012 (defeating runner-up
Kingsway Regional High School
in the finals) and in Group II in 2014 (vs.
Robbinsville High School
)
[49]
In 2012, the softball team defeated Kingsway Regional High School to win the Group III state championship by a score of 1-0 in 11 innings.
[50]
The 2014 team finished with a record of 28-2 after winning the Group II title with a 2-1 win against Robbinsville in the championship game.
[51]
Arts
[
edit
]
High Point offers a variety of different classes that are involved in the arts, including but not limited to: Choral, Concert Choir, Concert Band, Piano Lab, and Theatre. Each class offers different levels, depending on how many years the student has been enrolled in that particular class. These classes present their findings of the course through concerts, which are open to the public twice a year, once in the Winter and again in the Spring. This department also offers extra curricular activities such as: Chambers Choir, Fall Dramas, Spring Musicals, and Marching Band. The Marching Band as well as the Chambers Choir has been known to compete in several different competitions.

edit
]
In February 2020, there were 891 students, with 84 being from Montague Township.
[17]
The report "Montague Township School District High School Route Evaluation" stated that 85 Montague Township students went to High Point Regional.

Musical artist
Héctor Juan Pérez Martínez
(30 September 1946 - 29 June 1993),
[3]
better known as
Héctor Lavoe
, was a
Puerto Rican
salsa
singer.
[4]
Lavoe is considered to be possibly the best and most important singer and interpreter in the history of
salsa music
because he helped to establish the popularity of this musical genre in the decades of 1960s, 1970s and  1980s. His personality, style and the qualities of his voice led him to a successful artistic career in the whole field of
Latin music
and
salsa
during the 1970s and 1980s. The cleanness and brightness of his voice, coupled with impeccable diction and the ability to sing long and fast phrases with total naturalness, made him one of the favorite singers of the Latin public.
[5]
[6]
Lavoe was born and raised in the
Machuelo Abajo
barrio
of
Ponce, Puerto Rico
. Early in his life, he attended
Escuela Libre de Música de Ponce
, known today as the
Instituto de Música Juan Morel Campos
[7]
and, inspired by Jesús Sánchez Erazo, developed an interest in music.
[8]
He moved to
New York City
on 3 May 1963, at the age of sixteen.
[8]
Shortly after his arrival, he worked as the singer in a sextet formed by Roberto García.
[8]
During this period, he performed with several other groups, including Orquesta New York,
Kako All-Stars
, and
Johnny Pacheco
's band.
In 1967, Lavoe joined
Willie Colón
's band as its vocalist,
[9]
recording several hit songs, including "El Malo" and "Canto a Borinquen." Lavoe moved on to become a soloist and formed his own band performing as lead vocalist.
[9]
As a soloist, Lavoe recorded several hits including: "El cantante" composed by
Rubén Blades
, "Bandolera" composed by Colón, and "Periódico de ayer", composed by
Tite Curet Alonso
. During this period he was frequently featured as a guest singer with the
Fania All Stars
recording numerous tracks with the band.
[8]
In 1979, Lavoe became deeply
depressed
and sought the help of a high priest of the
Santería
faith to treat his drug addiction. After a short rehabilitation, he relapsed following the deaths of his father, son, and mother-in-law.
[3]
These events, along with being diagnosed with
HIV
from intravenous drug use, drove Lavoe to attempt suicide by jumping off a Condado hotel room balcony in
San Juan, Puerto Rico
.
[3]
He survived the attempt and recorded an album before his health began failing. Lavoe died on 29 June 1993, from a complication of
AIDS
.
[8]
Early life
[
edit
]
A "
Mi Gente
" mural of Lavoe in his hometown of
Ponce, Puerto Rico
Héctor was born 30 September 1946 in
Ponce, Puerto Rico
, to Francisca (Pachita) Martínez and Luis Pérez, and raised in the
Machuelo Abajo
barrio
of the city.
[10]
He was inspired early in life by his musically talented family. His grandfather, Don Juan Martínez, was a singer of controversial songs, which led to physical confrontations. His uncle was well known in Ponce as a
tres
player.
[10]
His mother Francisca, also known as Pachita, was well known by her family and townspeople for her beautiful singing voice.
[10]
His father, Luis, supported his wife and eight children by singing and playing guitar with trios and big bands. He was in high demand as a guitarist for the Fiestas de Cruz celebrations and other popular religious ceremonies, and he wanted his son to receive formal musical training as a trombonist; Héctor dreamt of being a singer.
[11]
Héctor was influenced by Puerto Rican singers such as Jesús Sánchez Erazo, also known as "Chuíto el de Bayamón" - one of the island's most successful folk singers, and
Daniel Santos
.
[10]
Later in his life, he would record songs with both artists.
Héctor attended the local
Juan Morel Campos
Public School of Music where the first instrument he learned to play was the
saxophone
. His classmates included José Febles and multi-instrumentalist
Papo Lucca
.
[12]
One of his teachers was very strict and demanded that he practice good diction and manners, and have a strong stage presence. He felt Héctor would become a superstar as a
bolero
singer. From the start Héctor was a star with exceptional charisma, talent, and charm. One of a kind, his unique voice, refined and with impeccable diction, demanded attention. Well on his way to becoming a popular-music vocalist, he began frequenting clubs such as Segovia, where he sang accompanied by his childhood friends, Roberto García and
José Febles
.
[11]
At age 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band.
[9]
He moved permanently to New York on 3 May 1963, against his father's wishes, as an older brother had moved there and later died of a drug overdose.
[13]
[14]
It would take many years before Héctor was able to reconcile with his father.
Arrival in New York City
[
edit
]
Upon arriving in New York he was met by his sister Priscilla.
[15]
The first thing that he did was to visit El Barrio, New York's "
Spanish Harlem
."
[15]
Héctor was disappointed by the condition of El Barrio which he had envisioned would have "fancy Cadillacs, tall marble skyscrapers, and tree-lined streets."
[15]
Héctor tried to earn a living as a painter, messenger, porter and concierge.
[11]
One day he reconnected with his friend Roberto García. They began to frequent Latin music and dance clubs in the Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and Lower Manhattan. In 1965, Héctor met Russell Cohen, who fronted the New Yorkers - the band Héctor would first record with - the album
Está de bala.
[11]
Héctor was invited by his friend Roberto García, a fellow musician and childhood friend, to a rehearsal of a newly formed
sextet
.
[15]
When he arrived, they were rehearsing the romantic
bolero
"Tus Ojos". The lead vocalist was singing off key, and as a goodwill gesture, Lavoe demonstrated how it was supposed to sound.
[15]
As a result of this selfless act, the group offered him the job of lead vocalist, which he subsequently accepted.
[15]
Later in his career he joined other salsa groups including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and
Johnny Pacheco
's FANIA . To distinguish Héctor from other Latino singers, a former manager made him adopt
Felipe Rodríguez
's moniker "La Voz" ("The Voice") and turned it into a stage name, Lavoe.
[15]
In 1967, he met salsa musician and bandleader
Willie Colón
. Johnny Pacheco, owner of
Fania Records
, and as its recording musical director, suggested that Colón record with Lavoe on a track on Colón's first album
El Malo
. Given the good results, Colón had Lavoe recorded the rest of the album's vocal tracks. Willie never officially asked Lavoe to join his band, but after the recording, said to him: "On Saturday we start at 10 p.m. at El Tropicoro Club."
[16]
The album's success significantly transformed both Colón's and Lavoe's lives.
[15]
Colón's band featured a raw, aggressive, all-trombone sound that was well received by salsa fans, and Lavoe complemented the style with his articulate voice, talent for improvisation, and sense of humor.
[15]
The album was a massive multimillion-dollar success in France, Panama, Colombia and other countries.
[11]
Héctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle.
[15]
According to Lavoe, it happened so fast he did not know how to cope with his sudden success. With the sudden fame came love and lust and experimentation with marijuana, heroin, and cocaine.
[11]
During that year, Lavoe started a romantic relationship with Carmen Castro. She became pregnant but refused to marry him because she considered him a "
womanizer
."
[17]
Lavoe's first son, José Alberto Pérez, was born on 30 October 1968.
[17]
On the night José was baptized, Héctor received a call informing him that Nilda "Puchi" Román, with whom he also had a relationship during the same period he was with Castro, was pregnant.
[17]
Héctor's second son, Héctor Pérez Jr. was born on 25 September 1969.
[17]
Following the birth the couple married, and at Román's request, Lavoe had only minimum contact with Castro and José Alberto during their marriage.
[17]
Music
[
edit
]
The Willie Colón years
[
edit
]
Willie Colón and Lavoe made fourteen albums together.
[18]
In late 1970, Colón and Lavoe recorded the first of two
Asalto Navideño
albums, featuring Puerto Rican folk songs such as Ramito's
jíbaro
song "Patria y Amor", renamed "Canto a Borinquen", and original compositions.
[19]
Lavoe's lack of professionalism was often balanced by an affable onstage presence, very much resembling that of a
stand-up comedian
.
[20]
One famous incident involved a middle-aged audience member at a dance who requested a Puerto Rican Man
danza
from Colón's band; Lavoe responded with an insult.
[20]
The requester then gave Lavoe such a beating that he almost ended up in the hospital. The request was finally honored on a later Colón record,
El Juicio
(The Trial), when he added a danza section to the Rafael Muñoz song "Soñando despierto", which Lavoe introduces with a deadpanned: "¡Para ti, motherflower!" - a
euphemism
for: "This one's for you,
motherfucker
!"
[20]
The Colón band had other major hits, such as "Calle Luna, Calle Sol", and the
Santería
-influenced "Aguanile", a Pacheco song recorded in the studio by the band. "
Mi Gente
", was better known for a live version Lavoe recorded later with the
Fania All Stars
.

In 1973, Willie Colón stopped touring to focus on record production and other business enterprises. Lavoe was given the opportunity to become the bandleader of his own orchestra.
[8]
He and his band traveled the world on their own, and he would also be a guest singer with the
Fania All-Stars
for several shows. One of the group's notable performances took place in the
Kinshasa
province of the
Zaire
(modern day Democratic Republic of Congo) where the group performed as part of the activities promoting
The Rumble in the Jungle
, a boxing fight between
Muhammad Ali
and
George Foreman
for the heavyweight championships of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association.
[21]
The Fania All Stars recorded several of their tracks during live concerts. Lavoe was part of the group when the All-Stars returned to Yankee Stadium in 1975, where the band recorded a two volume production entitled
Live at Yankee Stadium
. The event featured the top vocalists of Fania and Vaya records. Lavoe was included in the group along with: Ismael Miranda, Cheo Feliciano,
Justo Betancourt
, Ismael Quintana, Bobby Cruz,
Pete "El Conde" Rodriguez
, Santos Colón, and Celia Cruz. Lavoe recorded songs with the band in fifteen different productions, serving as vocalist on twenty-three songs. Besides recording songs with the band, Lavoe was also present in three movies filmed and produced by Fania Records; these were:
Fania All Stars: Our Latin Thing
,
Fania All Stars: Salsa,
and
Celia Cruz with the Fania All Stars: Live in Africa
.
[8]
His Colón-produced albums would be best sellers; cuts from these albums were hits in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America:
Lavoe's recording of
Tite Curet Alonso
's "El Periódico de Ayer" was a number one hit on Mexican charts for four straight months. It was also a strong hit in several Caribbean countries and South America.
[12]
As a producer, Willie Colón had Lavoe record what would become his
signature song
, the
Ruben Blades
-authored song "El Cantante" against Blades' protests (Blades wanted to record the song on his own.). Blades has repeatedly acknowledged since then that Lavoe raised his song to classic status
[22]
and that Lavoe's performance was much better than what he would accomplish with it.
[

In 1975 on his “La Voz” Album, Lavoe does a cover Chappottin Y Sus Estrellas’s 1957 song “Rompe Saragüey”,
[23]
which becomes a major success.
The Lavoe song "Bandolera" was a strong seller in Puerto Rico, despite vigorous protests from Puerto Rican feminists about its lyrics and soneos - Lavoe twice offers the song's subject a beating.
[12]
Lavoe's recording of the classic Cuban song by Eliseo Grenet
[24]
based on Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén's poem "Sóngoro Cosongo", set to salsa music, was another major hit.
[17]
The controversial
jíbaro
song, "Joven contra viejo", featured Lavoe and
Daniel Santos
settling their age-based differences on stage not without a heavy dose of humor and, yet again, Yomo Toro's cuatro music as a backdrop. Another major Christmas hit on
Billboard
Greatest Hits for Tropical genre in 1979 includes a song from singer/composer
Miguel Poventud
"Una Pena En La Navidad" from the same album titled
Feliz Navidad
.
[12]
Lavoe's final hit, "El Rey de la Puntualidad" (The King of Punctuality), is a humorous takeoff on Lavoe's constant tardiness and occasional absenteeism from shows.
[25]
[26]
Lavoe followed the Santeria priest's advice and cut all communication with his family and friends for a period of two months.
[26]
Following this recording Héctor, reappeared confident and apparently free of his drug addiction.
[26]
Last years and death
[

Lavoe's grave at
Cementerio Civil de Ponce
, Bo.
Portugués Urbano
, Ponce.
Following his rehabilitation, Lavoe's life was plagued by tragic events, emotional turmoil, and pain.
[26]
In 1987, his seventeen-year-old son Héctor Jr. was accidentally shot and killed by a friend. In the same period, his apartment in
Rego Park, Queens
, was destroyed in a fire. One year later, Héctor was scheduled to perform at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum in
Bayamón, Puerto Rico
on the night of Saturday 25 June 1988. Sales for the concert were poor, and promoter
Rick Sostre
decided to cancel the concert two hours before concert time. Héctor, defiant to the end, and knowing that it would be one of the last times he would perform in Puerto Rico, decided, against the promoter's wishes, to perform for the public who had paid to see the concert.
[3]
The next day, 26 June 1988, Héctor attempted suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of the Regency Hotel Condado in
San Juan, Puerto Rico
.
[16]
He survived the attempt, but from that day forward, would never completely recover.
[3]
[27]
In 1990, Héctor gave his last large, public performance with the Fania All Stars at the Meadowlands in New Jersey.
[15]
It was meant to be his comeback concert, but Héctor could not even sing a few notes of his famous song "Mi Gente".
[15]
It is believed his final public performance was a brief appearance at the club S.O.B.'s in New York City, in April 1992.
[28]
On 29 June 1993, Héctor died at
Saint Clare's Hospital (Manhattan)
from a complication from AIDS.
[8]
He was 46. He was initially buried in
Saint Raymond's Cemetery
in
the Bronx
. In June 2002, the remains of Lavoe and his son were exhumed at his family's request and reburied in his native Ponce, along with his widow Nilda who had died a few weeks before. His remains are at the
Cementerio Civil de Ponce
(Ponce Civil Cemetery), in that city's
Portugués Urbano
neighborhood.
[29]
Recognition
[

Lavoe's statue
in
Paseo Tablado La Guancha
, Ponce, Puerto Rico.
Lavoe's life has inspired two
biographical films
. The first,
El Cantante
, was produced by salsa artist
Marc Anthony
, who played Lavoe, and
Jennifer Lopez
as Hector's wife, Nilda (known as "Puchi" by close friends).
[30]
Salsa singer
La India
also began production of her own
biopic
of Lavoe's life entitled
The Singer
, with actor and singer
Raulito Carbonell
in the lead role.
[31]
Production was suspended in August 2008 after the director, Anthony Felton, reported that it was over budget. Carbonell noted that he would reconsider his involvement if production were to resume.
[32]
The movie was eventually completed, in 2011, as "Lavoe: The Untold Story".
[33]
An
Off-Broadway
production based on Lavoe's life titled
¿Quién mató a Héctor Lavoe?
(
Who Killed Hector Lavoe?
) was a success in the late 1990s.
[34]
It starred singer
Domingo Quiñones
in the lead role.
[35]
Carbonell's decision to distance himself from the film directed by Felton was the direct result of his involvement in a tour of
Quien Mato a Héctor Lavoe?
in Puerto Rico, and, depending upon negotiations, possibly
Peru
and
Colombia
.
[32]
[36]
An urban tribute album was released in late 2007 performed by several reggaeton artists such as
Don Omar
which sampled Lavoe's voice.
[37]
In Ponce, he is recognized at the
Park for the Illustrious Ponce Citizens
.
[38]
Lavoe was posthumously inducted into the
International Latin Music Hall of Fame
in 2000.
[39]
La Guancha Recreational and Cultural Complex
in his hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico,
honored Hector with a statue
. The $60,000 statue is 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) tall, weighs 1 ton and portrays Lavoe with a microphone in his right hand and a pair of
maracas
in his left.
[40]
Tremont Avenue
in the New York City's Borough of The Bronx was renamed in his honor, and remembrance.
[41]
In 2023,
Rolling Stone
ranked Lavoe at number 73 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Teaching English as a second language
v

English
is a
West Germanic language
in the
Indo-European language family
, whose speakers, called
Anglophones
, originated in
early medieval England
.
[4]
[5]
[6]
The namesake of the language is the
Angles
, one of the ancient
Germanic peoples
that
migrated
to the island of
Great Britain
.
Modern English
is both the
most spoken language
in the world
[7]
and the
third-most spoken native language
, after
Mandarin Chinese
and
Spanish
.
[8]
It is also the most widely learned
second language
in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers.
English is either the official language or one of the official languages in
59 sovereign states
(such as in India, Ireland, and Canada). In some other countries, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law (such as in the United States or United Kingdom).
[9]
It is a
co-official language of the United Nations
, the
European Union
, and many other international and regional organisations. English accounts for at least 70% of total speakers of the Germanic language branch, and as of 2005, it was estimated that there were over two billion speakers worldwide.
[10]
Old English
emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the
Anglo-Saxons
who migrated to Britain. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from
Old Norse
, a
North Germanic language
.
[11]
[12]
[13]
Then,
Middle English
borrowed words extensively from
French dialects
, which make up about
28%
of Modern English words, and from
Latin
, which also provides about
28%
.
[14]
Thus, although most of its overall vocabulary comes from
Romance languages
, its grammar and most of its core vocabulary are Germanic, and it is
genealogically
still classified under the Germanic branch. English exists on a
dialect continuum
with
Scots
and then is most closely related to the
Low Saxon
and
Frisian languages
.

A family tree of the
West Germanic
language family
English is an
Indo-European language
and belongs to the
West Germanic
group of the
Germanic languages
.
[15]
Old English
originated
from a Germanic tribal and
linguistic continuum
along the
Frisian
North Sea
coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the
Anglic languages
in the
British Isles
, and into the
Frisian languages
and
Low German
/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the
Anglo-Frisian languages
, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the
Ingvaeonic
(North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.
[12]
Old English evolved into
Middle English
, which in turn evolved into Modern English.
[16]
Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including
Scots
[17]
and the extinct
Fingallian
dialect and
Yola language
of
Ireland
.
[18]
Like
Icelandic
and
Faroese
, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and it has since diverged considerably. English is not
mutually intelligible
with any continental Germanic language, differing in
vocabulary
,
syntax
, and
phonology
, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.
[19]
Unlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly
Old Norse
and
Norman French
. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic
clades
—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a
mixed language
or a
creole
—a theory called the
Middle English creole hypothesis
. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.
[20]
[21]
English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares
innovations
with other Germanic languages such as
Dutch
,
German
, and
Swedish
.
[22]
These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called
Proto-Germanic
. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into
strong
and
weak
classes, the use of
modal verbs
, and the sound changes affecting
Proto-Indo-European
consonants, known as
Grimm's
and
Verner's laws
. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the
palatalisation
of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see
Phonological history of Old English § Palatalization
).
[23]
History
Main article:
History of English
Overview of history
The earliest varieties of an English language, collectively known as
Old English
or "Anglo-Saxon", evolved from a group of
North Sea Germanic
dialects brought to Britain in the 5th century. Old English dialects were later influenced by
Old Norse
-speaking
Viking
settlers and invaders
, starting in the 8th and 9th centuries.
Middle English
began in the late 11th century after the
Norman Conquest
of England, when considerable
Old French
, especially
Old
Norman French
, and
Latin-derived
vocabulary
was incorporated into English over some three hundred years.
[24]
[25]
Early Modern English
began in the late 15th century with the start of the
Great Vowel Shift
and the
Renaissance
trend of borrowing further
Latin
and
Greek
words and roots, concurrent with the introduction of the
printing press
to
London
. This era notably culminated in the
King James Bible
and
the works of William Shakespeare
.
[26]
[27]
The printing press greatly standardised English spelling,
[
citation needed
]
which has remained largely unchanged since then, despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in English dialects.
Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the
British Empire
and the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international
discourse
and the
lingua franca
in many regions and professional contexts such as science,
navigation
, and law.
[4]
Its
modern grammar
is the result of a gradual change from a typical
Indo-European
dependent-marking
pattern with a rich
inflectional
morphology
and relatively
free word order
to a mostly
analytic
pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed
subject-verb-object word order
.
[28]
Modern English relies more on
auxiliary verbs
and
word order
for the expression of complex
tenses
,
aspects
and
moods
, as well as
passive constructions
,
interrogatives
, and some
negation
.
Proto-Germanic to Old English
Main article:
Old English
The opening of
Beowulf
, an Old English epic poem
handwritten
in
half-uncial
script between 975 AD and 1025 AD:
Hƿæt ƿē Gārde/na ingēar dagum þēod cyninga / þrym ge frunon...
("Listen! We of the Spear-Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk-kings...")
The earliest form of English is called
Old English
or Anglo-Saxon (
c.
550-1066
). Old English developed from a set of
West Germanic
dialects, often grouped as
Anglo-Frisian
or
North Sea Germanic
, and originally spoken along the coasts of
Frisia
,
Lower Saxony
and southern
Jutland
by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the
Angles
,
Saxons
, and
Jutes
.
[29]
From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons
settled Britain
as
the Roman economy and administration collapsed
. By the 7th century, this Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons
became dominant in Britain
, replacing the languages of
Roman Britain
(43-409):
Common Brittonic
, a
Celtic language
, and
British Latin
, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.
[30]
[31]
[32]
At this time, these dialects generally resisted influence from the then-local Brittonic and Latin languages.
England
and
English
(originally
Ænglaland
and
Ænglisc
) are both named after the Angles.
[33]
Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects (
Mercian
and
Northumbrian
) and the Saxon dialects,
Kentish
and
West Saxon
.
[34]
Through the educational reforms of
King Alfred
in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of
Wessex
, the West Saxon dialect became the
standard written variety
.
[35]
The
epic poem
Beowulf
is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem,
Cædmon's Hymn
, is written in Northumbrian.
[36]
Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the
Scots language
developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a
runic script
.
[37]
By the 6th century, a
Latin alphabet
was adopted, written with
half-uncial
letterforms
. It included the runic letters
wynn
⟨
ƿ
⟩
and
thorn
⟨
þ
⟩
, and the modified Latin letters
eth
⟨
ð
⟩
, and
ash
⟨
æ
⟩
.
[37]
[38]
Old English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern
German
:
nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs
had many more
inflectional endings and forms
, and word order was
much freer
than in Modern English. Modern English has
case forms
in pronouns (
he
,
him
,
his
) and has a few verb inflections (
speak
,
speaks
,
speaking
,
spoke
,
spoken
), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more
person
and
number
endings.
[39]
[40]
[41]
Its closest relative is
Old Frisian
, but even some centuries after the Anglo-Saxon migration, Old English retained considerable
mutual intelligibility
with other Germanic varieties. Even in the 9th and 10th centuries, amidst the
Danelaw
and other
Viking
invasions, there is historical evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility,
[42]
although probably the northern dialects of Old English were more similar to Old Norse than the southern dialects. Theoretically, as late as the 900s AD, a commoner from certain (northern) parts of England could hold a conversation with a commoner from certain parts of Scandinavia. Research continues into the details of the myriad tribes in peoples in England and Scandinavia and the mutual contacts between them.

Matthew 8:20
from 1000 shows examples of case endings (

[44]
From the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through
language contact
into
Middle English
. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the
conquest of England
by
William the Conqueror
in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200 to 1450.
First, the waves of Norse (Viking) colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with
Old Norse
, a
North Germanic
language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the
Danelaw
area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in
Scots
and
Northern English
. The centre of norsified English was in the
Midlands
around
Lindsey
. After 920 CE, when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, English spread extensively throughout the region. An element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the pronoun group beginning with
th-
(
they, them, their
) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with
h-
(
hie, him, hera
).
[45]
Other core
Norse loanwords
include "give", "get", "sky", "skirt", "egg", and "cake", typically displacing a native Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English, particularly northern ones.
With the
Norman Conquest of England
in 1066, the now-Norsified Old English language was subject to another wave of intense contact, this time with
Old French
, in particular
Old Norman French
. Old Norman French in England eventually developed into
Anglo-Norman
.
[24]
Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking English, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of
loanwords
related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.
[13]
Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating
possession
. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,
[46]
and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.
[47]
In Wycliff'e Bible of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written:
Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis
.
[48]
Here the plural suffix
-n
on the verb
have
is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes
Geoffrey Chaucer
's
The Canterbury Tales
, and
Thomas Malory
's
Le Morte d'Arthur
. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.
[49]
Early Modern English
Main article:
Early Modern English
Graphic representation of the
Great Vowel Shift
showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500-1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the
Great Vowel Shift
(1350-1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.
The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a
chain shift
, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system.
Mid
and
open vowels
were
raised
, and
close vowels
were
broken
into
diphthongs
. For example, the word
bite
was originally pronounced as the word
beet
is today, and the second vowel in the word
about
was pronounced as the word
boot
is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.
[50]
[51]
English began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of
Henry V
. Around 1430, the
Court of Chancery
in
Westminster
began using English in its
official documents
, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as
Chancery Standard
, developed from the dialects of London and the
East Midlands
. In 1476,
William Caxton
introduced the
printing press
to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.
[52]
Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of
William Shakespeare
and the
translation of the Bible
commissioned by
King James I
. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the
consonant clusters
/kn
ɡn
sw/
in
knight
,
gnat
, and
sword
were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.
[53]
In the 1611
King James Version
of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says, "The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests."
[43]
This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with subject-verb-object word order, and the use of
of
instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (
ayre
) and word replacements (
bird
originally meaning "nestling" had replaced OE
fugol
).
[43]
Spread of Modern English
By the late 18th century, the
British Empire
had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.
[54]
[4]
English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent
states
that had multiple
indigenous languages
opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.
[55]
[56]
[57]
In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a
superpower
following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the
BBC
[58]
and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.
[59]
[60]
In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.
[61]
As Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755
Samuel Johnson
published his
A Dictionary of the English Language
, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828,
Noah Webster
published the
American Dictionary of the English language
to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.
[62]
In modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as
he
and
him
,
she
and
her
,
who
and
whom
), and SVO word order is mostly fixed.
[62]
Some changes, such as the use of
do-support
, have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.
[63]
Now, do-support with the verb
have
is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in
-ing
, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as
had been being built
are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g.
dreamed
instead of
dreamt
), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g.
more polite
instead of
politer
). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the United States as a world power.

English is the

[68]
The countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country. The "inner circle"
[69]
countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.
Three circles of English-speaking countries

Braj Kachru
's
Three Circles of English
The Indian linguist
Braj Kachru
distinguished countries where English is spoken with a
three circles model
.
[69]
In his model,
the "inner circle" countries have large communities of native speakers of English,
"outer circle" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and
"expanding circle" countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language.
Kachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.
[70]
Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the
United States
(at least 231 million),
[71]
the
United Kingdom
(60 million),
[72]
[73]
[74]
Canada
(19 million),
[75]
Australia
(at least 17 million),
[76]
South Africa
(4.8 million),
[77]
Ireland
(4.2 million), and
New Zealand
(3.7 million).
[78]
In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.
[79]
The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.
[70]
Estimates of the numbers of
second language
and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1 billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.
[9]
Linguist
David Crystal
estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.
[80]
In Kachru's three-circles model, the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the
Philippines
,
[81]
Jamaica
,
[82]
India
,
Pakistan
,
Singapore
,
[83]
Malaysia
and
Nigeria
[84]
[85]
with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.
[86]
Those countries have millions of native speakers of
dialect continua
ranging from an
English-based creole
to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.
[79]
Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,
[79]
and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.
[79]
In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the "expanding circle".
[87]
The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.
[86]
For example, in the
Netherlands
and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,
[88]
and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding circle". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.
[89]
Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use the language.
[90]
Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.
[91]
Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries. This is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences.
[92]

Australia (4.7%)
South Africa (1.3%)

English is a
pluricentric language
, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.
[93]
[94]
[95]
[96]
Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their
accents
,
[97]
but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international
standard written English
. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.
[98]
American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.
[99]
Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.
[100]
The settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce
koineised
forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
[101]
The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,
[71]
[102]
and English has been given official or co-official status by 30 of the 50 state governments, as well as all five territorial governments of the US, though there has never been an official language at the
federal
level.

Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.
[108]
Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.
[109]
As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.
[56]
[57]
[110]
For example, the view of the
English language
among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.
[111]
English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.
[112]
However, English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.
[113]
[114]
David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,
[115]
but the number of English speakers in India is uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.
[116]
Modern English, sometimes described as the first global
lingua franca
,
[59]
[117]
is also regarded as the first
world language

[118]
[119]
English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.
[119]
English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required

English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.
[123]
It achieved parity with
French
as a language of diplomacy at the
Treaty of Versailles
negotiations in 1919.
[124]
By the time of the foundation of the
United Nations
at the end of
World War II
, English had become pre-eminent
[125]
and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.
[126]
It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.
[127]
Many other worldwide international organisations, including the
International Olympic Committee
, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.
Many regional international organisations such as the
European Free Trade Association
,
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN),
[60]
and
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.
[128]
Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a
foreign language
.
[59]
[60]
In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and
Malta
). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.
[129]
A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine
[130]
and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by
Chemical Abstracts
in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.
[131]
International communities such as international business people may use English as an
auxiliary language
, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked
Globish
uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.
[132]
Other examples include
Simple English
.
The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about
language death
,
[133]
and to claims of
linguistic imperialism
,
[134]
and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.
[135]
Although some scholars
[
who?
]
mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a
koineised
language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.
[136]
English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.
[137]
Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any
constructed language
proposed as an
international auxiliary language
, including
Esperanto
.
[138]

Phonology
Main article:
English phonology
The
phonetics
and
phonology
of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of
phonemes
(i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.
[140]
This overview mainly describes the
standard pronunciations
of the

obstruents
(stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as
/p
b/
,
/tʃ
dʒ/
, and
/s
z/
, the first is
fortis
(strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as
/p
tʃ
s/
are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as
/b
dʒ
z/
, and are always
voiceless
. Lenis consonants are partly
voiced
at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as
/p/
have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are
aspirated
[pʰ]
when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often
unreleased
[p̚]
or pre-glottalised
[ʔp]
at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus
nip
has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than

Main article:
English phonology § Vowels
The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel
phonemes
in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from
lexical sets
compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.

In RP, vowel length is phonemic;
long vowels
are marked with a
triangular colon
⟨
ː
⟩
in the table above, such as the vowel of
need
[niːd]
as opposed to
bid
[bɪd]
. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.
In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically
shortened before fortis consonants
in the same
syllable
, like
/t
tʃ
f/
, but not before lenis consonants like
/d
dʒ
v/
or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of
rich
[rɪtʃ]
,
neat
[nit]
, and
safe
[seɪ̯f]
are noticeably shorter than the vowels of
ridge
[rɪˑdʒ]
,
need
[niˑd]
, and
save
[seˑɪ̯v]
, and the vowel of
light
[laɪ̯t]
is shorter than that of
lie
[laˑɪ̯]
. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.
[151]
The vowel
/ə/
only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.
[152]
[153]
Some dialects do not contrast
/ɪ/
and
/ə/
in unstressed positions, so that
rabbit
and
abbot
rhyme and
Lenin
and
Lennon
are homophonous, a dialect feature called
weak vowel merger
.
[154]
GA
/ɜr/
and
/ər/
are realised as an
r
-coloured vowel
[ɚ]
, as in
further
[ˈfɚðɚ]
(phonemically
/ˈfɜrðər/
), which in RP is realised as
[ˈfəːðə]
(phonemically
/ˈfɜːðə/
).
[155]
Phonotactics
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in
sprint
/sprɪnt/
, and end with up to five, as in (for some dialects)
angsts
/aŋksts/
. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCCC), where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word
strengths
/strɛŋkθs/
is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in
play
; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in
fly
or
sly
;
s
and a voiceless stop, as in
stay
; and
s
, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in
string
.
[156]
Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions:
/h/
can only occur in syllable-initial position, and
/ŋ/
only in syllable-final position.
[157]
Stress, rhythm and intonation
See also:
Stress and vowel reduction in English
and
Intonation (linguistics) § English
Stress
plays an important role in English. Certain
syllables
are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently
reduced
while vowels in stressed syllables are not.
[158]
Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as
can
, have
weak and strong forms
depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.
Stress in English is
phonemic
, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word
contract
is stressed on the first syllable (
/
ˈ
k
ɒ
n
t
r
æ
k
t
/
KON
-trakt
) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (
/
k
ə
n
ˈ
t
r
æ
k
t
/
kən-
TRAKT
) for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.
[159]
[160]
[161]
Here stress is connected to
vowel reduction
: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel
/ɒ/
, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to
/ə/
. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g.
a burnout
(
/
ˈ
b
ɜːr
n
aʊ
t
/
) versus
to burn out
(
/
ˈ
b
ɜːr
n
ˈ
aʊ
t
/
), and
a hotdog
(
/
ˈ
h
ɒ
t
d
ɒ
ɡ
/
) versus
a hot dog
(
/
ˈ
h
ɒ
t
ˈ
d
ɒ
ɡ
/
).
[162]
In terms of
rhythm
, English is generally described as a
stress-timed
language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.
[163]
Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in
vowel quality
:

Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as
Canada
,
Australia
,
Ireland
,
New Zealand
and
South Africa
have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English and their features".
[165]
English has undergone many
historical sound changes
, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the
Great Vowel Shift
, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the
Northern Cities Vowel Shift
and
Canadian Shift
have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.
[166]
Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and
phones
than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a
voiceless
[
ʍ
]
sound in
whine
that contrasts with the voiced
[w]
in
wine
, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced
[w]
, a dialect feature called
wine
-
whine
merger
. The unvoiced velar fricative sound
/x/
is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes
loch
/lɔx/
from
lock
/lɔk/
. Accents like
Cockney
with "
h
-dropping" lack the glottal fricative
/h/
, and dialects with
th
-stopping
and
th
-fronting
like
African-American Vernacular
and
Estuary English
do not have the dental fricatives
/θ,
ð/
, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops
/t,
d/
or labiodental fricatives
/f,
v/
.
[167]
[168]
Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as
yod
-dropping
,
yod
-coalescence
, and reduction of consonant clusters.
[169]
[
]
General American
and
Received Pronunciation
vary in their pronunciation of historical
/r/
after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the
syllable coda
). GA is a
rhotic dialect
, meaning that it pronounces
/r/
at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses
/r/
in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide
/r/
like RP or keep it like GA.
[170]
There is complex dialectal variation in words with the
open front
and
open back vowels
/æ
ɑː
ɒ
ɔː/
. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three
/æ
ɑ
ɔ/
,
[171]
and in Canadian English, they merge to two
/æ
ɑ/
.
[172]
In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with
lexical sets
in which these sounds occur.
Grammar
Main article:
English grammar
As is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows
accusative
morphosyntactic alignment
. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional
case system
in favour of
analytic
constructions. Only the
personal pronouns
retain morphological case more strongly than any other
word class
. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into
subordinators
and
coordinators
, and add the class of interjections.
[173]
English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as
have
and
do
, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by
do-support
,
wh-movement
(fronting of question words beginning with
wh
-) and word order
inversion
with some verbs.
[174]
Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected
strong
stems inflected through
ablaut
(i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs
speak/spoke
and
foot/feet
) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as
love/loved
,
hand/hands
).
[175]
Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (
he/him, who/whom
) and in the inflection of the
copula
verb
to be
.
[175]
The seven word-classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:
[176]
The
chairman
of
the
committee
and
the
loquacious
politician
clashed
violently
when
the
meeting

Nouns and noun phrases
Main article:
English nouns
English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into
proper nouns
(names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into
count nouns
and
mass nouns
.
[177]
Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural
suffix
-
s
, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g.
one loaf of bread
,
two loaves of bread
.
[178]
Regular plural formation:
Singular:
cat, dog
Plural:
cats, dogs
Irregular plural formation:
Singular:
man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse
Plural:
men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice
Possession can be expressed either by the possessive
enclitic
-
s
(also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition
of
. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the
of
possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -
s
also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe. If the noun is plural formed with -s the apostrophe follows the -s.
[174]
Possessive constructions:
With -s:
The woman's husband's child
With of:
The child of the husband of the woman
Nouns can form
noun phrases
(NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.
[179]
Noun phrases can be short, such as
the man
, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g.
red
,
tall
,
all
) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g.
the
,
that
). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as
and
, or prepositions such as
with
, e.g.
the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles
(this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.
[174]
For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in
The President of India's wife
, where the enclitic follows
India
and not
President
.
The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of
definiteness
, where
the
marks a definite noun and
a
or
an
an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include
one
,
many
,
some
and
all
, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g.
one man
(sg.) but
all men
(pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.
[180]
Adjectives
Main article:
English adjectives
English adjectives are words such as
good
,
big
,
interesting,
and
Canadian
that most typically modify nouns,
denoting
characteristics of their
referents
(e.g.,
a
red
car
). As modifiers, they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.
[181]
English adjectives also function as predicative complements (e.g.,
the child is
happy
).
In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected so as to
agree
in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases
the slender boy
, and
many slender girls
, the adjective
slender
does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.
Some adjectives are inflected for
degree of comparison
, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix
-er
marking the comparative, and
-est
marking the superlative:
a small boy
,
the boy is smaller than the girl
,
that boy is the smallest
. Some adjectives have irregular
suppletive
comparative and superlative forms, such as
good
,
better
, and
best
. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by
periphrastic constructions
, with the adverb
more
marking the comparative, and
most
marking the superlative:
happier
or
more happy
,
the happiest
or
most happy
.
[182]
There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.
[183]
Determiners
Main article:
English determiners
English determiners are words such as
the
,
each
,
many
,
some
, and
which
, occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as
definite
or indefinite.
[184]
They often agree with the noun in
number
. They do not typically inflect for degree of comparison.
Pronouns, case, and person
Main article:
English pronouns
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (
I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them
) as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing
it
from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns) and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular (distinguishing between
she/her
[feminine],
they/them
[
epicene
], and
he/him
[masculine]).
[185]
[186]
The
subjective case
corresponds to the Old English
nominative case
, and the
objective case
is used in the sense both of the previous
accusative case
(for a patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and of the Old English dative case (for a recipient or
indirect object
of a transitive verb).
[187]
[188]
The subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, otherwise the objective is used.
[189]
While grammarians such as
Henry Sweet
[190]
and
Otto Jespersen
[191]
noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin-based system, some contemporary grammars, for example
Huddleston & Pullum (2002)
, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.
Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in
my chair
), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g.
the chair is mine
).
[192]
The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old second person singular familiar pronoun
thou
acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned).
Both the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular:
Plural and singular are always identical (
you
,
your
,
yours
) in the second person (except in the reflexive form:
yourself/yourselves
) in most dialects. Some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns, such as
y'all
(found in
Southern American English
and
African-American (Vernacular) English
),
youse
(found in
Australian English
), or
ye
(in
Hiberno-English
).
In the third person, the
they/them
series of pronouns (
they
,
them
,
their
,
theirs
,
themselves
) are used in both plural and singular, and are the only pronouns available for the plural.
In the singular, the
they/them
series
(sometimes with the addition of the singular-specific reflexive form
themself
) serve as a
gender-neutral
set of pronouns. These pronouns are becoming more accepted as part of the
LGBT culture
.

Pronouns are used to refer to entities
deictically
or
anaphorically
. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun
I
identifies the speaker, and the pronoun
you
, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as
that
refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence
I already told you that
. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for impact").
[195]
Prepositions
Main article:
English prepositions
Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g.
with the dog
,
for my friend
,
to school
,
in England
.
[196]
Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.
[196]
For example, in the phrase
I gave it to him
, the preposition
to
marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb
to give
. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of
Huddleston & Pullum (2002
:598-600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.

Verbs and verb phrases
Main article:
English verbs
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb
to be
is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.
[182]
Auxiliary verbs such as
have
and
be
are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form
complex
tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.
[197]
[198]
Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.
[199]
The copula verb
to be
is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is
am
, the third person singular form is
is
, and the form
are
is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is
been
and its gerund-participle is
being
.

Tense, aspect and mood
English has two primary tenses, past (preterite) and non-past. The preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix
-ed
, and for the strong verbs either the suffix
-t
or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix
-s
.
[197]
Present
Preterite
First person
I run

English does not have future verb forms.
[200]
The future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs
will
or
shall
.
[201]
Many varieties also use a
near future
constructed with the
phrasal verb
be going to
("
going-to future
").
[202]
Future
First person
I will run
Second person
You will run
Third person
John will run
Further aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs, primarily
have
and
be
, which show the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (
I have run
vs.
I was running
), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (
I had been running
) and present perfect (
I have been running
).
[203]
For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as
can
,
may
,
will
,
shall
and the past tense forms
could
,
might
,
would
,
should
. There are also
subjunctive
and
imperative moods
, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular
-s
), for use in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive:
It is important that he run every day
; imperative
Run!
).
[201]
An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition
to
, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.
[204]
For example,
he has to go
where only the auxiliary verb
have
is inflected for time and the main verb
to go
is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as
I saw him leave
, where the main verb is
see
, which is in a preterite form, and
leave
is in the infinitive.
Phrasal verbs
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called
phrasal verbs
, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are
to get up
,
to ask out
,
to back up
,
to give up
,
to get together
,
to hang out
,
to put up with
, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly
idiomatic
meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g.
lay off
meaning
terminate someone's employment
).
[205]
In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including
Huddleston & Pullum (2002
:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e.
he woke up in the morning
and
he ran up in the mountains
are syntactically equivalent.
Adverbs
Main article:
English adverbs
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.
[174]
Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix
-ly
. For example, in the phrase
the woman walked quickly
, the adverb
quickly
is derived in this way from the adjective
quick
. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as
good
, which has the adverbial form
well
.
Syntax
In the English sentence
The cat sat on the mat
, the subject is
the cat
(a noun phrase), the verb is "sat", and "on the mat" is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase "the mat", headed by the preposition "on".
Modern English syntax language is moderately
analytic
.
[206]
It has developed features such as
modal verbs
and
word order
as resources for conveying meaning.
Auxiliary verbs
mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the
passive voice
and progressive
aspect
.
Basic constituent order
English word order has moved from the Germanic
verb-second (V2) word order
to being almost exclusively
subject-verb-object
(SVO).
[207]
The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as
he had hoped to try to open it
.
In most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.
[208]
The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:
The dog
bites
the man
S
V
O
The man
bites
the dog
S
V
O
An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.
[209]
The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:
He
hit
him
S
V
O
Indirect objects
(IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as
I gave
Jane
the book
or in a prepositional phrase, such as
I gave the book
to Jane
.
[210]
Clause syntax
Main article:
English clause syntax
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase
I think (that) you are lying
, the main clause is headed by the verb
think
, the subject is
I
, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause
(that) you are lying
. The subordinating conjunction
that
shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.
[211]
Relative clauses
are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence
I saw the letter that you received today
, the relative clause
that you received today
specifies the meaning of the word
letter
, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns
who
,
whose
,
whom
and
which
as well as by
that
(which can also be omitted.)
[212]
In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.
[213]
Auxiliary verb constructions
Main articles:
Do-support
,
English auxiliary verbs
, and
Subject-auxiliary inversion
English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence
the dog did not find its bone
, the clause
find its bone
is the complement of the negated verb
did not
.
Subject-auxiliary inversion
is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.
The verb
do
can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I
did
shut the fridge." However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English
syntax
permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present.
Modern English
does not allow the addition of the negating adverb
not
to an ordinary
finite
lexical verb, as in
*I know not
—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or
copular
) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary
do
is used, to produce a form like
I do not (don't) know.
The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say
*Know you him?
; grammatical rules require
Do you know him?
[214]
Negation is done with the adverb
not
, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not
-n't
can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb
to be
. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English
I don't know him
is the correct answer to the question
Do you know him?
, but not
*I know him not
, although this construction may be found in older English.
[215]
Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb
to be
or
to get
, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with
get
. For example, putting the sentence
she sees him
into the passive becomes
he is seen (by her)
, or
he gets seen (by her)
.
[216]
Questions
Both
yes-no questions
and
wh
-questions
in English are mostly formed using
subject-auxiliary inversion
(
Am I going tomorrow?
,
Where can we eat?
), which may require
do
-support
(
Do you like her?
,
Where did he go?
). In most cases,
interrogative words
(
wh
-words; e.g.
what
,
who
,
where
,
when
,
why
,
how
) appear in a
fronted position
. For example, in the question
What did you see?
, the word
what
appears as the first constituent despite being the
grammatical object
of the sentence. (When the
wh
-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs:
Who saw the cat?
.)
Prepositional phrases
can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g.
To whose house did you go last night?
. The personal interrogative pronoun
who
is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant
whom
serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.
[217]
Discourse level syntax
While English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a
topic-comment
structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction,
the girl was stung by the bee
. Another way is through a
cleft sentence
where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a
dummy subject
such as
it
or
there
, e.g.
it was the girl that the bee stung
,
there was a girl who was stung by a bee
.
[218]
Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g.,
it is raining
) or in existential clauses (
there are many cars on the street
). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.
Focus constructions
emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example,
the girl was stung by
a bee
(emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or
The girl
was stung by a bee
(contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).
[219]
Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example,
That girl over there, she was stung by a bee
, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition,
she was stung by a bee, that girl over there
, where reference to the girl is established as an "afterthought".
[220]
Cohesion
between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as
anaphora
(e.g.
that is exactly what I mean
where
that
refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or
then
used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).
[221]
Discourse markers
such as
oh
,
so
or
well
, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for
stance taking
in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example,
no way is that true!
(the idiomatic marker
no way!
expressing disbelief), or
boy! I'm hungry
(the marker
boy
expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.
[222]
Vocabulary
See also:
Foreign-language influences in English
It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if
obsolete words
are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the
Oxford English Dictionary
from 1989.
[223]
Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin
species names
,
scientific terminology
,
botanical terms
,
prefixed
and
suffixed
words,
jargon
, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical
acronyms
.
[224]
Due to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by
lexicographers
, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality
linguistic corpora
,
[225]
collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.
[224]
[226]
Word formation processes
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,
[227]
using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,
[224]
[226]
producing compound words such as
babysitter
or
ice cream
or
homesick
.
[227]
A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (
-hood
,
-ness
,
-ing
,
-ility
) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of
Latin
or
Greek origin
).
Formation of new words, called
neologisms
, based on
Greek and/or Latin roots
(for example
television
or
optometry
) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, American lexicographer
Philip Gove
attributed many such words to the "
international scientific vocabulary
" (ISV) when compiling
Webster's Third New International Dictionary
(1961). Another active word-formation process in English are
acronyms
,
[228]
words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases, e.g.
NATO
,
laser
.
Word origins
Main articles:
Foreign-language influences in English
and
Lists of English words by country or language of origin

Linguistic purism in English
Source languages of the English vocabulary
[11]
[229]
Latin (29%)
(Old) French
, including Anglo-French (29%)
Germanic languages (Old/Middle English, Old Norse, Dutch) (26%)
Greek (6%)
Other languages/unknown (6%)
Derived from proper names (4%)
English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This borrowing is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.
[230]
Nevertheless, most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in English are still West Germanic.
[231]
[232]
The English words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly Germanic words from Old English.
[224]
It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words, but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords.
[233]
But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.
[234]
Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without
orthographical
change by French speakers.
[235]
Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and
northern England
. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as
egg
and
knife
.
[236]
English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.
[226]
[224]
Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.
[237]
English continues to gain new loanwords and
calques
("loan translations") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.
[238]
English has formal and informal
speech registers
; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.
[239]
[240]
English loanwords and calques in other languages
Main article:
Englishization
English has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.
[234]
[241]
The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world
lingua franca
, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.
[242]
That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.
[243]
Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as
calques
, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.
[244]
Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.
[244]
Writing system
See also:
English alphabet
,
English Braille
, and
English orthography
Since the ninth century, English has been written in a
Latin alphabet
(also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in
Anglo-Saxon runes
are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.
[37]
The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the
Latin script
:
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
,
f
,
g
,

(which also have
capital
forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
The spelling system, or
orthography
, of English is multi-layered and complex, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.
[245]
Further complications have arisen through
sound changes
with which the orthography has not kept pace.
[50]
Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.
[246]
There are also systematic
spelling differences between British and American English
. These situations have prompted
proposals for spelling reform in English
.
[247]
Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.
[248]
Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words
photograph
,
photography
, and
photographic
,
[248]
or the words
electricity
and
electrical
. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is "near-optimal",
[245]
there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.
[249]
The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.
[250]
Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.
[251]
Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or
digraphs
used to spell consonant sounds. The letters
b
,
d
,
f
,
h
,
j
,
k
,
l
,
m
,
n
,
p
,
r
,
s
,
t
,
v
,
w
,
y
,
z
represent, respectively, the phonemes
/b,
d,
f,
h,
dʒ,
k,
l,
m,
n,
p,
r,
s,
t,
v,
w,
j,
z/
. The letters
c
and
g
normally represent
/k/
and
/ɡ/
, but there is also a
soft
c
pronounced
/s/
, and a
soft
g
pronounced
/dʒ/
. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters
c
and
g
are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include
ch
for
/tʃ/
,
sh
for
/ʃ/
,
th
for
/θ/
or
/ð/
,
ng
for
/ŋ/
,
qu
for
/kw/
, and
ph
for
/f/
in Greek-derived words. The single letter
x
is generally pronounced as
/z/
in word-initial position and as
/ks/
otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin
[248]
or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.
[252]
For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (
a
,
e
,
i
,
o
,
u
,
w
,
y
). As a result, some "
long vowels
" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the
oa
in
boat
, the
ow
in
how
, and the
ay
in
stay
), or the historically based
silent
e
(as in
note
and
cake
).
[249]
The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.
[253]
Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.
[248]
Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.
[254]
[255]
Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.
[256]
English writing also includes a system of
punctuation
marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.
[257]
Dialects, accents and varieties

Dialectologists identify many

, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate
regional accents
. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of
British English
(BrE) and
North American English
(NAE).

A map showing the main dialect regions in the
United Kingdom
and
Ireland
The fact that English has been spoken in England for 1,500 years explains why England has a great wealth of regional dialects.
[259]
Within the United Kingdom, the
Received Pronunciation
(RP), an educated dialect of
South East England
, is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the
Survey of English Dialects
, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.
[260]
Nonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary. In fact, only 3% of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.
[261]
There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.
[262]
Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class; some traits, though exceedingly common, are nonetheless considered "non-standard" and associated with lower-class speakers and identities. An example of this is
h
-dropping
, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England. However, it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.
[263]
English in England
can be divided into four major dialect regions:
Southwest English
, South East English, Midlands English, and
Northern English
. Within each of these regions, several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the
Yorkshire
dialects and the
Geordie
dialect spoken in
Northumbria
around
Newcastle
, and the
Lancashire
dialects with local urban dialects in
Liverpool
(
Scouse
) and
Manchester
(
Mancunian
). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.
[264]
Since the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the
Cockney
dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the South East led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.
[265]
[266]
[267]
Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of
intrusive R
(
drawing
is pronounced
drawring
/ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/
),
t
-glottalisation
(
Potter
is pronounced with a glottal stop as
Po'er
/ˈpɒʔə/
) and the pronunciation of
th-
as
/f/
(
thanks
pronounced
fanks
) or
/v/
(
bother
pronounced
bover
).
[268]
Scots
is today considered a separate language from English, but it has
its origins
in early Northern Middle English
[269]
and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly
Scots Gaelic
and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. In addition to Scots,
Scottish English
comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.
[270]
In
Ireland
, various forms of English have been spoken since the
Norman invasions
of the 11th century. In
County Wexford
, in the area surrounding
Dublin
, two extinct dialects known as
Forth and Bargy
and
Fingallian
developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern
Irish English
, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into
Ulster English
, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the
rhoticity
which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.

Percentage of Americans aged 5+ speaking English at home in each public usage microdata area (PUMA) of the 50 states,
Washington, D.C.
, and
Puerto Rico
. according to the 2016-2021 five-year
American Community Survey
Rhoticity
dominates in
North American English
, but
The Atlas of North American English
found over 50% non-rhoticity with at least one local speaker in each U.S. metropolitan area (designated with a red dot) and non-rhotic
African-American Vernacular English
pronunciations found primarily among
African Americans
regardless of location.
North American English
is generally homogeneous compared to
British English
, but this has been disputed.
[272]
American accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,
[273]
though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,
[274]
known collectively as
General American English
(GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves, including
Midland
and
Western American English
.
[275]
[276]
[277]
In most American and Canadian English dialects,
rhoticity
(or
r
-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (or
r
-dropping) being associated with lower prestige and social class, especially since the end of
World War II
. This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.
[278]
The English language is far and away the most widely used language in the
United States
. Its roots trace back to the
British colonial era
, which began with the settlement in present-day
Jamestown, Virginia
in 1607. While
German
was the predominant language among
German
immigrants, who arrived primarily in eastern
Pennsylvania
, English was ultimately widely adopted throughout the
Thirteen Colonies
that ultimately launched both the
American Revolution
and
American Revolutionary War
against the
Kingdom of Great Britain
, then rules by
King George III
and establishing the United States as an independent sovereign nation in September 1783.
Separate from the General American English are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems that have developed over time, including
Southern American English
, English of the coastal
Northeastern United States
, including
Eastern New England English
,
New York City English
, and
African-American Vernacular English
, all of which are historically non-rhotic.
Canadian English
varieties, except for those of the
Atlantic provinces
and perhaps
Quebec
, are also classified as General American English, although they often show
raising
of the vowels
/
aɪ
/
and
/
aʊ
/
before
voiceless consonants
and have distinct written and pronunciation norms as well.
[279]
In
Southern American English
, the most populous American "accent group" outside of the General American English,
[280]
rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's
historical non-rhotic prestige
.
[281]
[282]
[283]
Southern accents are colloquially described as a "drawl" or "twang",
[284]
being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by
glide-deleting
in the
/aɪ/
vowel (e.g. pronouncing
spy
almost like
spa
), the "Southern breaking" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word "press" almost like "pray-us"),
[285]
the
pin-pen merger
, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.
[286]
Spoken primarily by working- and middle-class
African Americans
,
African-American Vernacular English
(AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard
older Southern dialects
. A minority of linguists,
[287]
contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a
pidgin
or
Creole English
to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.
[288]
AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of "broken" or "uneducated" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities.

Since 1788, English has been spoken in
Oceania
, and
Australian English
has developed as the first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being
General Australian
. The
English of neighbouring New Zealand
has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.
[291]
Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by
South African English
and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the
South Island
of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely with British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in
the government is
rather than
are
).
[292]
[293]
New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.

The first significant exposure of the
Philippines
to the English language occurred in 1762 when the
British occupied Manila
during the
Seven Years' War
, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946 and remains an official language of the Philippines. Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, being found on
street signs
and marquees, in government documents and forms, in courtrooms, in the media and entertainment industries, in the business sector, and in various other aspects of daily life.
[297]
One particularly prominent form of English usage in the country is found in everyday speech: most
Filipinos
from
Manila
use or, at the very least, have been exposed to
Taglish
, a form of code-switching between
Tagalog
and English.
[298]
A similar code-switching method is used by urban native speakers of
Bisayan languages
under the name of
Bislish
.

English is spoken widely in southern Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In
South Africa
, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with
Afrikaans
and various African languages such as the
Khoe
and
Bantu languages
. Today, about 9 percent of the South African population speaks
South African English
(SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.
[299]
Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.
[300]
Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce
/p,
t,
t͡ʃ,
k/
without aspiration (e.g.
pin
pronounced
[pɪn]
rather than as
[pʰɪn]
as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap
[ɾ]
instead of as the more common fricative.
[301]
Nigerian English is a
dialect of English
spoken in
Nigeria
.
[302]
It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g.
senior wife
). Over 150 million Nigerians speak English.
[303]
Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, the
Leeward
and
Windward Islands
and
Trinidad and Tobago
,
Barbados
, the
Cayman Islands
, and
Belize
. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English-based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are
Jamaican English
and
Jamaican Creole
. In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.
[304]
Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and
code-switching
between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as "basilect" and the more RP-like forms serving as the "acrolect", the most formal register.
[305]
Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs
/ei/
and
/ou/
are monophthongs
[eː]
and
[oː]
or even the reverse diphthongs
[ie]
and
[uo]
(e.g.
bay
and
boat
pronounced
[bʲeː]
and
[bʷoːt]
). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced
[t͡ʃail]
and "wind"
[win]
.
[306]
[307]
[308]
As a historical legacy,
Indian English
tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as
/t/
and
/d/
(often pronounced with retroflex articulation as
[ʈ]
and
[ɖ]
) and the replacement of
/θ/
and
/ð/
with dentals
[t̪]
and
[d̪]
. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling-based pronunciations where the silent
⟨h⟩
found in words such as
ghost
is pronounced as an Indian
voiced aspirated
stop
[ɡʱ]
.

Skeleton Crew
was an American
experimental
rock
and
jazz
group from 1982 to 1986, comprising core members
Fred Frith
and
Tom Cora
, with
Zeena Parkins
joining later. Best known for their live
improvisation
performances where they played various instruments simultaneously, they also recorded two studio albums
Learn to Talk
(1984) and
The Country of Blinds
(1986).
[1]
The group drew on music and themes from a number of sources, including
world music
, left-wing politics and pre-recorded tapes.
[2]
Writing in the
Santa Cruz Sentinel
, Lee Sherman described Skeleton Crew's sound as "unique and eclectic".
[2]
In her 1990 book,
Sonic Transports: New Frontiers in Our Music
, Nicole V. Gagné called the group "one of the hottest and imaginative rock acts I've ever heard."
[3]
In 2021, Frith said Skeleton Crew's stance was "sorta kinda demented anti-industry and even anti-music".
[4]
Biography
[
edit
]
After English guitarist
Fred Frith
's New York City band,
Massacre
disbanded in mid-1981, Frith and American cellist
Tom Cora
decided to form a
quartet
with ex-Massacre drummer
Fred Maher
and American guitarist
Tim Schellenbaum
[
de
]
.
[5]
[6]
But before their first performance, Maher and Schellenbaum both suffered
collapsed lungs
within two weeks of each other, leaving Frith and Cora with the choice of continuing on their own or abandoning the project.
[7]
They chose to continue, agreeing to play all the instruments themselves during live performances.
[7]
Frith played guitar, violin, keyboards, bass drum and hi-hat, while Cora played cello, bass guitar, homemade drums and other contraptions enabling him to play instruments with his feet.
[1]
[8]
Performing like this was a challenge for them and made the resulting music unpredictable, but as an improvising
duo
, this pleased them. It gave rise to a rhythmic tension not present in a group with just one drummer.
[8]
Frith said in a 1983 interview, "rhythmically, it throws up ways of playing that one person behind the drums just wouldn't be able to do, just in terms of coordination."
[9]
He told
DownBeat
magazine in 1982: "It's all just on the edge of breaking down all the time, which is a quality that I've always liked. I don't like things to be too easy."
[8]
One critic wrote that Skeleton Crew's performances were like a slowly sinking ship that somehow manages to return to port.
[5]
Gagné wrote that to make their live performances more challenging, Skeleton Crew played their roughly 50-minute sets with very few breaks, running most of their songs into one another.
[3]
Gagné remarked that their sets were a blend of "folk music, fake music, noise, political songs, taped events", and they "kept the audience on its toes" wondering what was coming next.
[3]
But she added that what really had the crowds cheering was for the band's "amazing technique", and that they could go on for so long.
[3]
Even when things occasionally went wrong for the duo, equipment malfunctions, missed cues, falling out-of-step with each other, Gagné said the audiences still enthusiastically spurred the band on.
[10]
Skeleton Crew's first concert was at the M.A.K. Festival in
Zürich
in May 1982, but Frith and Cora asked Dave Newhouse of
the Muffins
to join them. Frith said "we lost our nerve" about whether we would be able to pull off our act as a duo, and we performed as a trio on our first tour.
[4]
Newhouse left after the tour, but its success gave Frith and Cora the confidence to continue as a duo, and they performed over one hundred concerts in
Europe
,
North America
and
Japan
over the next eighteen months.
[4]
In October 1983 they joined
Duck and Cover
, a commission from the
Berlin Jazz Festival
, for a performance in
West Berlin
, followed by another in February 1984 in
East Berlin
.
[11]
In December 1983 Skeleton Crew performed at the 1st
Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville
in
Victoriaville
,
Quebec
, Canada.
[12]
Later in 1984, Skeleton Crew began work on their first studio album
Learn to Talk
in
Switzerland
. The LP (with sides named "Side Free" and "Side Dirt") featured music that was both sparse and raw and consisted of cynical and humorous "songs" interspaced with cello, guitar and violin instrumental fragments. It conveyed the energy of their live performances. Tapes also featured throughout the album:
Ronald Reagan
saying "We're still free in America", cut-ups of
Sousa
's "
Washington Post
" and TV ad clips.
[1]
[13]
Tapes had also become a part of their live act.
By now, Skeleton Crew had become "quite competent" with their two one-man-band act.
[7]
Later in 1984,
Zeena Parkins
, playing electric harp, keyboards and percussion, joined the band and remained until the end. As a trio, they made their second studio album
The Country of Blinds
in 1986 (again in Switzerland and produced by ex-Henry Cow member
Tim Hodgkinson
). Here the music was richer and more rhythmical than their first album. The songs were more developed but the cynical edge of the first album remained.
[14]
Soon after the recording sessions the group decided to split up. Frith explained why:
"We actually started to sound like a normal rock and roll band so it seemed kind of pointless to go on at that point."
[7]
Frith and Cora re-united again as Skeleton Crew in 1995 in the Netherlands at the Koeinverhuurbdrijf Studio,
Purmerland
to record a CD-ROM
Etymology
, a sound sample library of sonic sounds and wire manipulations.
[15]
In 2021, Frith assembled Skeleton Crew's first live album,
Free Dirt (Live)
, a double-CD of material taken from concerts recorded in Europe and North America between 1982 and 1986. It was released by Austrian record label, Klanggalerie in December 2021.

Biography
[
edit
]
Sally Ryan was born in New York City, the daughter of Allan Aloysius Ryan (1880-1940) and Sarah Tack Ryan. She was the granddaughter of
Thomas Fortune Ryan
, a successful Irish-American entrepreneur.
Allan A. Ryan, Jr.
was her elder brother. Fortune Ryan had commissioned a portrait bust of himself by Rodin, now in the Tate collection in London.
[3]
Sally Ryan's went to school in
Montreal
and her artistic career began in 1933, where she exhibited her first sculpture at the
Royal Canadian Academy of Arts
in Toronto.
[4]
The following year she went on to study with the sculptor
Jean Camus
in Paris, where she achieved an 'honourable mention' at the annual
Salon
. She exhibited work at
The Royal Academy of Arts
in London in 1935. Ryan was an associate of the poet
Ralph Gustafson
and sculptor
Jacob Epstein
. Epstein made a portrait bust of Ryan, who for a brief time became his, only, pupil.
[5]
[6]
Ryan would later purchase several important works by Epstein.
[5]
Aged twenty, Ryan had a successful solo show at the Cooling Gallery which included her portrait busts of
Ellen Ballon
,
Paul Robeson
and
Arturo Toscanini
.
[4]
After four years in London, Ryan returned to the United States in 1938.
[4]
Dividing her time between
Connecticut
and London, her work featured in exhibitions in both Europe and the United States.
[4]
In 1940, Ryan's work was included in Philadelphia's International Sculpture Exhibition, prior to her second solo show in New York the following autumn.
[6]
Ryan used much of the inheritance she received from her grandfather to build a wide-ranging art collection, alongside her life-long friend,
Kathleen Garman
. Ryan died of cancer of the throat (squamous cell epithelioma of the larynx) in 1968 while staying at the
Dorchester Hotel
in London.
[1]
[2]
[7]
She bequeathed $50,000 and her art collection to Kathleen Garman to establish the
Garman-Ryan collection
, now housed at the
The New Art Gallery Walsall
.
[3]
As well as several works by Ryan, the collection also contains many works by Jacob Epstein, Garman's husband.

John Justin & the Thunderwings
were an Australian rock band formed by John Justin (guitar, vocals), Paul Hines (keyboards), Gordon Pitt (bass, vocals), Carl Manuel (drums) in 1985. In 1987, Tony Featherstone (bass) replaced Pitt and Robert Wodrow (drums) replaced Manuel. They released one full length album,
Justice
, in 1986.
[1]
Debbie Cameron of
The Canberra Times
described the impact of the album, "I am not wildly enthusiastic about this type of music so I do not want to be unduly unfriendly about it. All I will say is that Justin appears to be a competent exponent."
[2]
Australian musicologist,
Ian McFarlane
, felt "[it] was brimming with swaggering glam-pop material."
[1]
Their debut single "Flash King Cadillac" (1986) was co-produced by Ross Fraser. Fraser was nominated for

) is the largest
continent
[note 2]
[11]
[12]
in the world by both land area and population.
[12]
It covers an area of more than 44 million square kilometers,
[note 3]
about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8% of Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the
human population
,
[13]
was the site of many of the
first civilizations
. Its 4.7 billion people
[14]
constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined.
[15]
Asia shares the
landmass
of
Eurasia
with
Europe
, and of
Afro-Eurasia
with both Europe and
Africa
. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the
Pacific Ocean
, on the south by the
Indian Ocean
, and on the north by the
Arctic Ocean
. The border of Asia with Europe is a
historical and cultural construct
, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in
classical antiquity
. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects
East-West
cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the
Suez Canal
separating it from
Africa
; and to the east of the
Turkish Straits
, the
Ural Mountains
and
Ural River
, and to the south of the
Caucasus Mountains
and the
Caspian
and
Black
seas, separating it from Europe.
[16]
China
and
India
alternated in being the
largest economies in the world
from 1 to 1,800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east,
[17]
[18]
[19]
and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia,
[20]
attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The
Silk Road
became the main east-west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the
Straits of Malacca
stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited
economic dynamism
(particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.
[21]
Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including
Hinduism
,
Zoroastrianism
,
Judaism
,
Jainism
,
Buddhism
,
Confucianism
,
Taoism
,
Christianity
,
Islam
,
Sikhism
, as well as many other religions.
Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a
name
dating back to
classical antiquity
—may actually have more to do with
human geography
than
physical geography
.

Asia varies greatly across and within
its regions
with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the
Middle East
, temperate areas in the east and the  continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in
Siberia
.
Definition and boundaries

, and

Asia-Africa boundary
The boundary between Asia and Africa is the
Red Sea
, the
Gulf of Suez
, and the
Suez Canal
.
[22]
This makes
Egypt
a
transcontinental country
, with the
Sinai peninsula
in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.
Asia-Europe boundary
Definitions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia in different periods of History. The commonly accepted
modern definition
mostly fits with the lines "
B
" and "
F
" in this image.
The threefold division of the
Old World
into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to
Greek geographers
such as
Anaximander
and
Hecataeus
.
[
citation needed
]
Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the
Phasis River
(the modern Rioni river) in
Georgia
of Caucasus (from its mouth by
Poti
on the
Black Sea
coast, through the
Surami Pass
and along the
Kura River
to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by
Herodotus
in the 5th century BCE.
[23]
During the
Hellenistic period
,
[24]
this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the
Tanais
(the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as
Posidonius
,
[25]
Strabo
[26]
and
Ptolemy
.
[27]
The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.
[28]
The
Don River
became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when
Peter the Great
, king of the
Tsardom of Russia
, defeating rival claims of
Sweden
and the
Ottoman Empire
to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of
Siberia
, synthesized a new
Russian Empire
extending to the
Ural Mountains
and beyond, founded in 1721.
[
citation needed
]
In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730
Philip Johan von Strahlenberg
published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the
Emba River
as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the
Ural River
prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.
[29]
The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the
Caucasus Mountains
, although it is sometimes placed further north.
[28]
Asia-Oceania boundary
The border between Asia and the region of
Oceania
is usually placed somewhere in the
Indonesia Archipelago
. The
Maluku Islands
are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with
Indonesian New Guinea
, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."
[30]
Asia-North America boundary
The
Bering Strait
and
Bering Sea
separate the
landmasses
of Asia and
North America
, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This
national
and continental boundary separates the
Diomede Islands
in the Bering Strait, with
Big Diomede
in
Russia
and
Little Diomede
in the
United States
. The
Aleutian Islands
are an island chain extending westward from the
Alaskan Peninsula
toward Russia's
Komandorski Islands
and
Kamchatka Peninsula
. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost
Near Islands
group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the
North Aleutians Basin
and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of
Alaska
as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate.
[31]
[32]
[33]
This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their
inhabitants
, who have historically been related to
Indigenous Americans
.
[34]
[35]
St. Lawrence Island
in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the
Rat Islands
in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points,
Alaska
and
Russia
are separated by only 4 kilometres (2.5 miles).
Ongoing definition
Afro-Eurasia
shown in green
Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the
Ancient Greeks
, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.
[36]
From the time of
Herodotus
a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.
[37]
For example, Sir
Barry Cunliffe
, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia".
[38]
Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of
Eurasia
with Europe being a northwestern
peninsula
of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—
Afro-Eurasia
(except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common
continental shelf
. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the
Eurasian Plate
, adjoined on the south by the
Arabian
and
Indian Plate
and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the
Chersky Range
) on the
North American Plate
.
Etymology
Ptolemy's Asia
The term "Asia" is believed to originate in the
Bronze Age
placename
Assuwa
(
Hittite
:
𒀸𒋗𒉿
,
romanized:
aš-šu-wa
) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern
Anatolia
. The term appears in
Hittite records
recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including
Troy
unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king
Tudhaliya I
around 1400 BCE.
[39]
[40]
[41]
Roughly contemporary
Linear B
documents contain the term
asiwia
(
Mycenaean Greek
:
𐀀𐀯𐀹𐀊
,
romanized:
a-si-wi-ja
), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.
[42]
[43]
The province of
Asia
highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire
Herodotus
used the term Ἀσία in reference to
Anatolia
and the territory of the
Persian Empire
, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of
Prometheus
, but that
Lydians
say it was named after
Asies
, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at
Sardis
.
[44]
In
Greek mythology
, "Asia" (
Ἀσία
) or "Asie" (
Ἀσίη
) was the name of a "
Nymph
or
Titan
goddess of Lydia".
[45]
The
Iliad
(attributed by the ancient Greeks to
Homer
) mentions two Phrygians in the
Trojan War
named
Asios
(an adjective meaning "Asian");
[46]
and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as
ασιος
.
[47]
According to many Muslims, the term came from
Ancient Egypt
's Queen
Asiya
, the adoptive mother of
Moses
.
[48]
The term was later adopted by the
Romans
, who used it in reference to the province of
Asia
, located in western Anatolia.
[49]
One of the first  writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was
Pliny
.
[50]
In languages of the
Chinese character cultural sphere
words related to the character 亜細亜 Yàxìyà are used. This has been criticized as implying an inferiority of the continent as 亜 means inferior. However it is a mere phonetic representation.
History
Main article:
History of Asia
The
Silk Road
connected civilizations across Asia.
[51]
The
Mongol Empire
at its greatest extent. The gray area is the later
Timurid Empire
.
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East (West Asia), linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian
steppes
.
The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in
Mesopotamia
, the
Indus Valley
and the
Yellow River
shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as
mathematics
and the
wheel
. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.
The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the
steppes
. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the
Indo-Europeans
, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the
Tocharians
resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of
Siberia
, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and
tundra
. These areas remained very sparsely populated.
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The
Caucasus
and
Himalaya
mountains and the
Karakum
and
Gobi
deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the
nomads
who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.
The Islamic
Caliphate
's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during
its conquests
of the 7th century. The
Mongol Empire
conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion,
Song dynasty
reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.
[52]
The
Black Death
, one of the most devastating
pandemics
in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the
Silk Road
.
[53]
The
Russian Empire
began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The
Ottoman Empire
controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the
Manchu
conquered China and established the
Qing dynasty
. The Islamic
Mughal Empire
and the Hindu
Maratha Empire
controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.
[54]
Western European colonisation of Asia
coincided with the
Industrial Revolution
in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies.
[55]
The
British Empire
became dominant in South Asia, with large parts of the region first being
conquered by British traders
before falling under
direct British rule
; extreme poverty doubled to over 50% during this era.
[56]
The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French,
[57]
while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British, Dutch and French.
[58]
Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the "
century of humiliation
", with the British-supported
opium trade
and later
Opium Wars
resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported.
[59]
[60]
Foreign domination of China was furthered by the
Empire of Japan
, which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the
Meiji era
of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia.
[61]
[62]
With the end of
World War II
in 1945 and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan, many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule.
[63]
The independence of India came along with the
carving out
of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims, which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh.
[64]
Some Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential.
[65]
East Asian nations (along with Singapore in Southeast Asia) became economically prosperous with high-growth "
tiger economies
",
[66]
with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century.
[67]
India has grown significantly because of
economic liberalisation
that started in the 1990s,
[68]
with extreme poverty now below 20%.
[69]
The threefold division of the
Old World
into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to
Greek geographers
such as
Anaximander
and
Hecataeus
.

The
Himalayan
range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.
Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of
Eurasia
. It is located to the east of the
Suez Canal
and the
Ural Mountains
, and south of the
Caucasus Mountains
(or the
Kuma-Manych Depression
) and the
Caspian
and
Black Seas
.
[16]
[71]
It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (
Georgia
,
Azerbaijan
,
Russia
,
Kazakhstan
and
Turkey
) are
transcontinental countries
lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a
European nation
, both
culturally
and politically.
The
Gobi Desert
is in
Mongolia
and the
Arabian Desert
stretches across much of the Middle East. The
Yangtze River
in China is the longest river in the continent. The
Himalayas
between
Nepal
and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

Climate
Main article:
Climate of Asia
Köppen-Geiger climate classification
map for Asia
[73]
Asia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the
Philippines
and south of Japan.

Climate change
is having major impacts on many countries in the continent.
A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm
Maplecroft
identified 16 countries that are extremely
vulnerable to climate change
. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of
Bangladesh
,
India
,
the Philippines
,
Vietnam
,
Thailand
,
Pakistan
,
China
and
Sri Lanka
were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change.
[74]
[75]
[76]
Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a
semi-arid climate
, the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics
(ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use
renewable energy
.
[77]
The ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - Brunei,
Cambodia
,
Indonesia
, Laos,
Malaysia
,
Myanmar
,
the Philippines
,
Singapore
,
Thailand
, and
Vietnam
- are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world, however, ASEAN's climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of China
[82]
and India grew rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.

According to
economic historian
Angus Maddison
in his book
The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective
, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output.

For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the
Soviet Union
(measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the
European Union
(EU), the
North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) or
APEC
). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.
[79]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined.
[79]
In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79
yen
/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the
Pacific Rim
, known as the
Asian tigers
, which are now all considered developed economies, having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia.

Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the
economy of India
.
Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China,
Taiwan
, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of
multinational corporations
, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore.
Call centers
and
business process outsourcing
(BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the
Strait of Malacca
via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa
Mombasa
, from there to
Djibouti
, then through the Red Sea over the
Suez Canal
into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and
Athens
to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of
Trieste
with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to
Barcelona
and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards
Los Angeles
and
Long Beach
. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.

In 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe.
[99]
Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's "economic center of gravity" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.

East Asia had by far the strongest overall
Human Development Index
(HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.
[104]
Nepal
, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present
life expectancy
is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.
[104]
Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the "very high human development" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22).
Afghanistan
(155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.

Languages of Asia
Asia is home to several
language families
and many
language isolates
. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to
Ethnologue
, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.
Religions

List of Asian mythologies
Many of the world's
major religions
have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding
irreligion
), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the
Great Flood
for example, as presented to Jews in the
Hebrew Bible
in the narrative of
Noah
—and later to Christians in the
Old Testament
, and to
Muslims
in the
Quran
—is earliest found in
Mesopotamian mythology
, in the
Enûma Eliš
and
Epic of Gilgamesh
.
Hindu mythology
similarly tells about an
avatar
of
Vishnu
in the form of a
fish
who warned
Manu
of a terrible flood. Ancient
Chinese mythology
also tells of a
Great Flood
spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

Judaism
, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in
Israel
, the
indigenous
homeland and historical birthplace of the
Hebrew nation
: which today consists both of those
Jews
who remained in
the Middle East
and those who returned from
diaspora
in
Europe
,
North America
, and other regions;
[108]
though various diaspora communities persist worldwide. Jews are the predominant ethnic group in
Israel
(75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million,
[109]
although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in
Turkey
(17,400),
[110]
Azerbaijan
(9,100),
[111]
Iran (8,756),
[112]
India (5,000) and
Uzbekistan
(4,000),
[113]
among many other places. In total, there are 14.4-17.5 million (2016, est.)
[114]
Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest Asian minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.
Christianity
is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to
Pew Research Center
in 2010,
[115]
and nearly 364 million according to
Britannica
Book of the Year 2014.
[116]
Constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia. In the Philippines and
East Timor
,
Roman Catholicism
is the predominant religion;
[117]
it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In
Armenia
and Georgia,
Eastern Orthodoxy
is the predominant religion.
[117]
In the Middle East, such as in the
Levant
,
Anatolia
and
Fars
,
Syriac Christianity
(
Church of the East
) and
Oriental Orthodoxy
are prevalent minority denominations,
[118]
which are both
Eastern Christian
sects mainly adhered to
Assyrian people
or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in
West Asia
are adhering to the
Eastern Catholic Churches
and
Eastern Orthodoxy
.
[117]
Saint Thomas Christians
in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of
Thomas the Apostle
in the 1st century.
[119]
Significant Christian communities also found in
Central Asia
,
South Asia
,
Southeast Asia
and
East Asia
.
[117]
Islam
, which originated in the
Hejaz
located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.
[120]
With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%),
Bangladesh
, Iran and Turkey.
Mecca
,
Medina
and
Jerusalem
are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The
Hajj
and
Umrah
attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest
Shi'a
country.
The
Druze
Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia, is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like
Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad
and
Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah
, and Greek
philosophers
such as
Plato
and
Aristotle
. The number of
Druze
people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in
Syria
, 35% to 40% live in
Lebanon
, and less than 10% live in
Israel
, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.
[121]
The
Baháʼí Faith
originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Baháʼí activities in many Muslim countries has been
severely suppressed
by authorities.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings.
Indian philosophy
includes
Hindu philosophy
and
Buddhist philosophy
. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India,
Cārvāka
, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
,
Jainism
and
Sikhism
originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan,
Confucianism
,
Taoism
and
Zen
Buddhism took shape.
As of 2012
, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and
Bali
, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.
The Hindu-Buddhist temple of
Angkor Wat

Cambodia
, the largest religious monument in the world
Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of

and small communities in India and
Bangladesh
. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.
Jainism
is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia.
Sikhism
is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia.
Confucianism
is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations.
Taoism
is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretized with
Mahayana Buddhism
, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

Culture
Main article:
Culture of Asia
The
culture of Asia
is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions:
Central Asia
,
East Asia
,
North Asia
,
South Asia
,
Southeast Asia
, and
West Asia
.
[143]
These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the
Middle East
, has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the
Fertile Crescent
and
Mesopotamia
, which gave rise to the
Persian
,
Arab
,
Ottoman
empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of
Judaism
,
Christianity
and
Islam
.
[144]
These civilizations, which are located in the
Hilly flanks
, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE.
[145]
Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a
Pan-Asian
culture that is shared across the region.
[146]
Nobel prizes
Indian polymath
Rabindranath Tagore
was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1913, and became Asia's first
Nobel
laureate.
The
polymath
Rabindranath Tagore
, a

(
Hebrew
:
ראובן ארזי
; 11 May 1907 - 19 May 1983) was an Israeli politician who served as a member of the
Knesset
for
Mapam
and the
Alignment
between 1965 and 1974.
Biography
[
edit
]
Born in
Mezhirichi
in the
Russian Empire
(today in
Ukraine
), Arazi was educated at a
gymnasium
in
Poland
, before studying law in
Warsaw
, where he was certified as a lawyer. He also graduated from the Judaic Studies Institute in the city. Whilst a student he was amongst the leadership of the Socialist Zionist student movement, and also joined
Hashomer Hatzair
.
Between 1933 and 1939, he worked in the
Tarbut
school system, but in 1940, following the Soviet invasion of Poland, was exiled to the
Urals
by the Soviet authorities. He returned to Poland in 1946 and re-established Hashomer Hatzair, becoming its secretary general. He was also involved with the
Jewish National Fund
, becoming a member of its board of directors.
[1]
In 1949, he made
aliyah
to Israel, where he joined
Mapam
, which had been formed by a merger of the
Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party
and the
Ahdut HaAvoda Poale Zion Movement
. In 1959, he became the party's political secretary, a role he held until 1965. In that year he was placed fifth on the Mapam list for the
Knesset elections
,
[2]
and was elected to the Knesset as the party won eight seats. He was re-elected in
1969
(by which time Mapam had formed the Alignment alliance), and was appointed Deputy
Speaker of the Knesset
. He was placed 103rd on the Alignment list for the
1973 elections
,
[3]
losing his seat as the alliance won 41 seats.
He died in 1983 at the age of 76.

Alexander John Buzo
(23 July 1944 - 16 August 2006) was an
Australian
playwright and author who wrote 88 works.
[1]
[2]
His literary works recorded Australian culture through wit, humour and extensive use of colloquial Australian English.
[3]
[4]
[5]
Biography
[
edit
]
Early life
[
edit
]
Alex Buzo was born on 23 July 1944 in
Sydney
.
[6]
[1]
His father
Zihni Jusuf Buzo
(1912-2006) was from
Berat
,
Albania
, an American
Harvard University
graduate and
civil engineer
of
Albanian origin
.
[6]
[7]
Elaine Johnson, an Australian teacher of
Irish descent
was his mother.
[6]
[7]
Buzo's brother, Adrian Buzo (born 1948,
Brisbane
)
[8]
[7]
is a
Korean studies
scholar and former Australian diplomat.
[9]
[10]
The first school Buzo attended was the Middle Harbour State Primary School.
[11]
Buzo's interests in his early years were shaped by his influential mother's sister Ailsa, a theatre and movie goer.
[11]
At age 10, Buzo and the whole family went to live in
Armidale
when his father got a position at the
University of New England
.
[2]
[5]
Buzo attended
The Armidale School
where his interest in drama developed.
[2]
[5]
[11]
His father later was employed in
Switzerland
and Buzo attended the
International School of Geneva
.
[2]
[5]
[11]
He formed a lifelong interest for both cricket and rugby in his youth where he participated as a player in team sports.
[12]
[11]
Buzo returned to Australia and held a job at the
Sydney Stock Exchange
for a year.
[11]
He attended and was a successful student at the
Australian National University
.
[11]
Later he went to the
University of New South Wales
, which had Australia's first drama course and graduated in 1965 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.
[5]
[1]
At the time Buzo worked as a barman in the Sydney suburb of
Neutral Bay
at the Oakes hotel.
[2]
Playwriting career
[
edit
]
Buzo started acting with the inner Sydney
New Theatre
company after being inspired by director Aarne Neeme and the
National Institute of Dramatic Art
(NIDA).
[11]
Later in Sydney he became a playwright at 21 and Buzo emerged as a prominent figure among Australian dramatists, part of the New Wave group.
[13]
[14]
[11]
Buzo was also involved with the Melbourne based
Australian Performing Group
(APG).
[13]
His talent was nurtured and developed at the
Producers Authors Composers and Talent
(PACT) Centre, founded in 1964.
[15]
In 1966 Buzo wrote
The Revolt
.
[4]
Norm and Ahmed
was written in 1968 after his friend
Pakistani
student Mohammed Kazim ("Kaz") was harassed in a pub by an older white Australian.
[11]
[16]
[4]
The play explored issues of racism within Australia and was a one act drama centred on two characters, the Anglo-Australian engineer Norm and a Pakistani student Ahmed at a bus stop.
[17]
[16]
[4]
The controversial play brought Buzo into the national spotlight and it was performed widely in Australian cities and also in
Britain
and the
US
.
[17]
[16]
[11]
Debates over censorship in theatre followed and the use of colourful Australian expressions like "fuckin' boong" in the play's last line resulted in obscenity charges against Buzo, then court cases with the matter ending up at the High Court in 1970.
[17]
[16]
[5]
The charges were eventually quashed by the Attorney-General.
During 1969, Buzo wrote two plays
The Front Room Boys
and
Rooted
.
[17]
[16]
[5]
The name
Rooted
got Buzo into difficulties as in Australian colloquial terminology the term used as a pun can mean sexual relations.
[17]
He wrote
The Roy Murphy Show
, a satirical play about a rugby television panel show in 1971
[18]
and two others in 1972,
Macquarie
, exploring issues of Australian identity and the past and
Tom
.
[17]
[16]
At age 28, Buzo became a resident playwright with the
Melbourne Theatre Company
.
[11]
In 1974, Buzo's
Coralie Lansdowne Says No
achieved much success and was about a woman's struggle for independence and challenges she encounters in life.
[19]
[20]
Other plays explored similar themes regarding social alienation and the pursuit of individuals seeking to attain and find purpose in a world that prevents it from happening like
Martello Towers
in 1976 and
Makassar Reef
in 1978.
[19]
[20]
Buzo was at the height of his career as his plays were often sold out performances and well received by attending audiences.
[11]
In 1980 Buzo wrote the
Big River
, in 1983
The Marginal Farm
, in 1987
Stingray
, in 1988
Shellcove Road
and in 1995
Pacific Union
.
[21]
[22]
[4]
Buzo was one of the early playwrights of the New Wave group to gain international attention for
Makassar Reef
,
Rooted
and
Tom
, being well received in the US.
[22]
Buzo's plays have also been performed in south East Asia and the UK.
[5]
Over the span of his career, Buzo was also a writer-in-residence for various schools, universities and theatre companies.
[5]
Businessman
David Hill
, an Oakes Hotel coworker from Buzo's university days sued him for defamation in the 1980s over an unsavoury character claimed to be based on Hill in
Makassar Reef
.
[23]
Both Hill and Buzo reconciled in 1990.
[24]
[11]
Subsequent career
[
edit
]
In later years Buzo wrote fiction including prose and topics covered ranged from the misusage of everyday language to sport.
[21]
Books he wrote on the Australian language and life that achieved popularity were
Tautology
and
Meet the New Class
both in 1981,
Glancing Blows
in 1987,
The Young Persons Guide to the Theatre
in 1988,
Kiwese
in 1994 and
A Dictionary of the Almost Obvious
in 1998.
[5]
[1]
Two novels by Buzo were
The Search for Harry Allway
in 1985 and
Prue Flies North
in 1991.
[4]
He wrote news articles about rugby and important books on cricket, the
Legends of the Baggy Green
(2004) and coauthored
The Longest Game: A Collection of the Best Cricket Writing from Alexander to Zavos, from the Gabba to the Yabba
(1992).
[25]
In his writing career he wrote for the children's animation show,
Arthur and the Square Knights of the Round Table
.
[26]
In 2001 he gave the 3rd annual
Tom Brock Lecture
.
[24]
[27]
Death
[
edit
]
Buzo died in
Sydney
on 16 August 2006 after several years battling
cancer
.
[11]
[1]
Style
[
edit
]
Early in his career, Buzo's writing style and use of wit was similar to his Australian playwright contemporary
David Williamson
.
[4]
Sometimes during his career, comparisons of Buzo to British playwright
Harold Pinter
were made.
[28]
Like Pinter, Buzo's works were marked by
surrealism
, use of triviality, colloquial expressions and language.
[29]
[4]
Over time Buzo's works also employed
romanticism
.
[4]
The topic of social alienation was often explored in Buzo's plays through their characters.
[22]
[19]
[5]
Buzo was an observer of language and it was reflected in his writing style through wit, humour and clever use of colloquial Australian English.
[30]
[4]
[5]
Apart from theatre plays, Buzo achieved success in most literary genres. He wrote many witty and insightful books on Australian life, language and sport,
[4]
and his articles on many varied subjects including reviews and travel writing were published in all the major newspapers and magazines in Australia.
[21]
[11]
[5]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Buzo was married for forty years to Merelyn Johnson ("Jock"), an art teacher from Armidale and the couple had three daughters, Emma, Laura and Genevieve and several grandchildren.
[1]
[11]
He supported the
North Sydney Bears
(later known as the Northern Eagles) and participated in the failed campaign to stop its demotion from the
National Rugby League
.
[31]
Legacy
[
edit
]
The Alex Buzo Company
[
edit
]
In 2007 Buzo's eldest daughter Emma formed The Alex Buzo Company.
[32]
[33]
Its aim is to produce, promote and perpetuate the work of Alex Buzo both in Australia and internationally. The company is supported by the Buzo family and manages his estate. It is dedicated to fostering the same level of excellence Buzo achieved in his career in contemporary Australian literature through innovative programs of theatre, education and training.
In honour of Buzo's life work, the
Alex Buzo Shortlist Prize
was created (2006) for Australian writers.

Panmure Island
is a small 800-acre (324 ha) island of
Canadian
red
sandstone
island, with sand beaches, located off the east coast of
Prince Edward Island
in the
Lot 61
township in
Kings County
.
[1]
The island is located about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the nearest point on Prince Edward Island.
The first visitors to Panmure Island were the Micmac First Nations Indians. The Micmac came to the island in the summer months to dig clams, mussels and quahaugs. The first full-time inhabitants of the island were settlers from
Scotland
, the first of which is believed to have been Andrew MacDonald and his family in 1805. The Panmure Island Cemetery was established in 1813.
Panmure Island was connected to Prince Edward Island by sand bars at low tide; however, since the 1960s, an artificial
causeway
has carried a road to the island. The causeway also created an extensive
barrier beach
and sand dune formation, which is now protected by
Panmure Island Provincial Park
;  this park is not actually located on the island but along the causeway.  The causeway has faced increased wave erosion in recent years. The provincial government has spent a significant amount to preserve the connection despite
rising sea levels
and increased storms.
The island contains the oldest wooden lighthouse on Prince Edward Island, near the northern end of the causeway. Built in 1853, the historic 18-metre-high (59 ft) lighthouse structure has gabled windows and four stories with a warning beacon atop. It sits on the northeast shore alerting ships of the dangerous shoals that have been responsible for several shipwrecks in the region. Tours of the lighthouse are available in the summer months.
A school was built on the island in 1897 for $150, and had a total of seven pupils the first year.
The island is home to the community of
Panmure Island
, which derives its name from the island.

and therefore one of the oldest still existing noble families in Europe. They carried the titles Knight, Lord, Count and Freiherr of different dominium plenum and dominium directum. This noble family thrived in the Middle Ages between 1300-1600 and had branches in Hessen, Saxony, Pommern and Westphalia (County Mark and Fbd. Münster) Falken.
[3]
The coat of arms this family used in Hessen and Thüringen and Saxony
Ancient Nobility Falcken Family
is different from the branch who was ruling parts of Pommern and Westphalia. The latter used a Griffin which was derived from the coat of arms of the "Greifenhaus" in Pommern. The griffin coat of arms still refers to the coat of arms used in Hessen and Thuringia and Saxony by using the same horns and red and white colours in the horns.
This Falcken family, whose patriarch is “Knight” Heyso Falcken, (mentioned in 1359) is a bastard son.
[4]
of the House of Hesse (they are descendants from the House of Reginar). The territory of the Falke/Falcken/Falken expanded between 1359 and 1557 from the Middle of Germany to the East.

v. Reck also merged with v. Falcken and this bloodline is still alive today Falkenreck

There is a small number of German noble families that do not carry “von”. These are the "
Uradel
" (e.g.
Haus Reuß

).
The branch in Saxony/Pommern merges in Westphalia with the Catholic branch of the powerful von Reck family.
[5]
This happens after Christoffel Falcken sells his castle in Triestewitz to the House of Saxony in order to leave the converted Lutheran Kingdom and move to West Germany to protect the Catholic Fbd. Münster on behalf of Charles V, who he advised together with the ancient noble family

. The Fal(c)ken "uradliger" family protects Fbd.Münster together with the Catholic branch of the von Reck (also von der Recke) family and together with the family von Raesfeld at the time when
Bernhard von Raesfeld

becomes the Regent of Münster (Fürstbischof of
Münster
in 1557). One of the Falkenreck estates (originally 250-300 acres), next to one of the Raesfeld estates in Gütersloh (Sundern), was sold in 2015 to the municipality of Gütersloh.
The Falkenreck estate is called Falkenrecks Heide.

This estate has been in the family since 1557. 
After the Holy Roman Empire lost power in Germany, the Fal(c)ken/Falkenreck noble family were not allowed to hold a governing position as long as they remained Catholic.

Controversies
[
edit
]
In September 1935, the association sent a memorandum to the Governor of
Madras
requesting withdrawal of concessions granted to villagers in Reserve Forests, involving Malayalees.
[1]
The association were involved in the aftermath of the
2008 attacks on Christians in southern Karnataka
, and participated in the protest on 20 February 2011 against the report of the official investigation of Judge
B. K. Somasekhara
into the attacks.
[2]
However, the president of Catholic Association of South Kanara, Dr Derek Lobo, filed a forgery case against Judge
M. F. Saldanha
, former Justice of the
Bombay High Court
, who conducted one of the investigations into the attacks and supported the denouncement of the Somasekhara report. This was condemned by the
People's Union of Civil Liberties
(PUCL) and NGOs from
Dakshina Kannada
; the PUCL called the association's action as "illegal, vicious, mala fide, motivated and vindictive", saying that "Justice Saldanha is regarded as one of the highly respected members of the Indian judiciary".
[3]
In February 2012, the
Income Tax Department
accused CASK of tax evasion and ordered a probe into it.
[4]
Functions
[

They meet annually at the
St Aloysius High School
.

The association is also involved with theatrical pursuits, having put on a performance of

French black metal band
Deathspell Omega
Origin

Genres
Black metal
Avant-garde metal
Years active
1998-present
Labels
Norma Evangelium Diaboli
Northern Heritage

Season of Mist
Musical artist
Deathspell Omega
is a French
black metal
band formed in 1998 in
Poitiers
. The group is an anonymous collective that has never confirmed the identity of any of its members.
Their lyrical content often deals with
metaphysical
Satanism
,
[1]
and the philosophies of
Bataille
[1]
[2]
and
Hegel
.
[3]
From 2004 to 2010, the band released a trilogy of concept albums —
Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice
,
Fas - Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum
and
Paracletus
-
which focus on the theological aspects of God and
Satan
. With the band's seventh album
The Furnaces of Palingenesia
(2019), there was a shift in lyrical focus to anti-authoritarian political themes.
[4]
The band's eighth and most recent album,
The Long Defeat
, was released on 23 March 2022.

History
[
edit
]
Initially, Deathspell Omega produced raw, traditional black metal akin to
Darkthrone
's
Transilvanian Hunger
. However, their 2004 release,
Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice
, marked a change to a more technical, experimental, and well-recorded sound with musical influences including
Russian Orthodox
chanting and
choral music
.
[5]
The band's work after
Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice
was more experimental and technical, with their output in 2005—
Kénôse
, "Mass Grave Aesthetics" and "Diabolus absconditus"—totaling nearly eighty minutes in length, longer than
Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice
. The second volume of the band's trilogy,
Fas - Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum
, was released on 16 July 2007, outside the United States, and the following day within the United States.
[6]
[7]
The band released another EP in January 2009, entitled
Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum: Chaining the Katechon
. The final album in the trilogy,
Paracletus
, was released by Norma Evangelium Diaboli and
Season of Mist
on 9 November 2010.
[8]
The band's final work related to the trilogy,
[9]
an EP titled
Drought
, was released on 22 June 2012.
Deathspell Omega's sixth full-length album,
The Synarchy of Molten Bones
, was made available early to download and stream on 31 October 2016
[10]
[11]
with a full physical release on 8 November.
[12]
[13]
The band's seventh full-length album,
The Furnaces of Palingenesia
, was released on 24 May 2019. It is presented as a manifesto from a
dictator
speaking for a political faction referred to as "the Order"; it is explicitly intended to deconstruct
authoritarian regimes
of both the left and the right. The band recorded the album live in a studio using analogue gear, and it was mastered more quietly than most of the band's preceding material, also reflecting a shift in production approach.
[4]
Without naming any of their members directly, the band also claimed there was an ideological rift within the band, noting: "A minority of the collective's contributors - shall we say, parts of the second circle - who've been invited to partake because of their incredible talents as musicians are involved with earthly politics, but stand on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum and are therefore irreconcilable political foes. Were it not for dialogue on the grounds of transgressive art, they'd be shooting each other. That tension is what interests us." They also state that the music and lyrics were authored by the "French core of the collective".
[4]
This clarification was made in the wake of backlash against Deathspell Omega due to their longtime collaboration with Finnish musician Mikko Aspa, who has released
National Socialist black metal
music under the solo project
Clandestine Blaze
and has ties to
RAC
acts.
Band members
[
edit
]
There is little to no concrete public information about Deathspell Omega's lineup. They do not have any official website, social media platform or promotional photos, have never performed live and do not list credits in their releases. Early interviews were deeply critical of the black metal scene,
[14]
[15]
and the last interview they agreed to until 2019 was conducted in 2004 by their North American label
The Ajna Offensive
, with questions and answers sent through the band's exclusive label, Norma Evangelium Diaboli, to preserve their anonymity.
[1]
Finnish musician
Mikko Aspa
is the band's current vocalist since 2012.
[1]
[16]
Hirilorn vocalist Shaxul stated that he was Deathspell Omega's vocalist until 2002, and has gone on record as leaving due to displeasure with the band's shift in themes.
[17]
In a 2014 interview discussing the most underrated guitarists in metal,
Gorguts
vocalist Luc Lemay named Christian Bouché as Deathspell Omega's guitarist, also giving his pseudonym Hasjarl.
[18]
The band contains a drummer, with a band member confirming that the only recordings to use a drum machine were the first four songs on the debut album
Infernal Battles
.
[4]
In a 2018 interview with
Loudwire
,
Tobias Forge
, lead singer of the band
Ghost
, stated that the French synthwave artist
Carpenter Brut
(Franck Hueso) was Deathspell Omega's producer.

and

.
[1]

History
[
edit
]
In 2006, Watt met Sam Dook of
The Go! Team
at
Big Day Out
.
[1]
Watt was intrigued by The Go! Team's use of
samples
.
[3]
I was kind of naïve or something, I wasn’t familiar with that technology, right?  I actually didn’t know, I thought they were playing all that stuff.  To me, tape recorders—you play music and the tape recorder captures it.  But this whole idea of samples…it’s a pretty creative tool and, you know, I wanted to explore it.
[3]
Dook and Watt began corresponding via email and decided to form a band. Watt visited Dook in Brighton while
The Stooges
were in London and they jammed for three days.
[4]
Watt suggested Dook use pieces of those sessions as samples to create new songs.
[4]
When Watt returned home to
San Pedro
he sent more bass tracks to Dook. Eventually, they finished the album over email
[5]
and named their project "CUZ" based on a zine
Richard Hell
put out decades earlier.
[3]
Their debut album, entitled
Tamatebako
, was released in 2014
[1]
and features guest vocals by
Charles Plymell
,
DJ Scotch Egg
, and fellow Go! Team member
Kaori Tsuchida

A Starbucks coffee with
whipped cream
in
Seoul
Coffee in South Korea
has been a strong element in South Korean culture.  Originating in the 19th century, it has become a prominent commodity in South Korean marketplaces.  It is one of the most popular beverages in the area.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
According to Junman Kang's
King Gojong goes to Starbucks
(한국어: 고종 스타벅스에 가다) states that King
Gojong
was the first person to taste coffee in Korea.
[2]
[3]
Antoinette Sontag, the sister-in-law of a Russian ambassador, treated the king to a cup of coffee in 1896. Koreans were curious about foreign cultures and the new beverage.
[2]
Because it came from the West and resembled Asian herbal medicine that only the rich could afford, it was consumed as a symbol of westernization and modernization. In the early days, people called coffee shop or café "
dabang
". The very first
dabang
in Korea was built by Sontag as named
Sontag Hotel
at Junggu Jeongdong in
Seoul
in 1902.
[
citation needed
]
The modern type of
dabangs
dates from 1927 in
Myeongdong
and were spread to
Jongno
and
Chungmuro
. At first
dabangs
were open to the royal family and people in high positions and later were used as politicians’ hall, artists’ headquarters, and businessmen's meeting place. Koreans were fascinated by
dabang
because they enjoyed the practice of drinking coffee in
dabang
atmosphere; it was a great pleasure to experience using forks to have cake and drinking coffee in a teacup instead of using
chopsticks
and drinking Korean traditional soup out of a bowl.
[2]
In mid-1900,
dabangs
continued to exist as a meeting place rather than as a place where people could drink coffee; however, it was not the time for ordinary citizens to consume coffee yet due to the high price. Before the introduction of coffee shops, people in high positions often held meetings at
kisaeng
houses while commoners hung out at
jumak
to talk about their lives and politics. Since
dabangs
were the center of debates about politics, economy, culture, education, art, and religion by people of different professions, the Korean government strictly restricted individuals’ visit to
dabangs
.
[2]
In that sense, Korean cafés in 1950s were very similar to Parisian cafés in the late seventeenth century when the “police [had] closely watched cafés” due to the cafés’ function as social institutions (Haine 1992, 608).
[

]
Coffee would remain a good consumed by the upper classes until the introduction of instant coffee in Korea during the Korean War (1950 - 1953) by the U.S. military.
[4]
Instant coffee became widely available before and after the Korean War and many Koreans began to enjoy coffee and later became regular drinkers.
[4]
In the 1960s, the value of coffee skyrocketed because coffee was prohibited from
dabangs
due to the movement of using domestic products after dictator
Park Chung-hee
’s
5.16 military coup d'état
in 1961. However,
dabangs
in general became more open to middle class citizens in 1960s. Although
dabangs
were still for adults only, it became a popular dating place for young men and women.
[2]
The first Korean theme café was probably a music
dabang
in the 1970s. This type of
dabang
had disk jockeys who received song requests from customers and played record music for them. It provided a feeling of freedom to college students who could not express their political opinions openly in 1970s.
[
citation needed
]
As the competition amongst
dabangs
increased in the 1980s, they decorated themselves with distinctive items, such as pink lights and indoor waterfalls, to survive in the increasingly crowded marketplace. At that time,
dabangs
underwent huge changes in their atmosphere and menu. For example, dark
dabangs
with dividers to block others' views changed into the ones with bright and cozier atmospheres.
[2]
This new type of coffee shop, which called themselves cafés to distinguish themselves from old style
dabangs
, began to focus on different kinds of coffee instead of selling traditional teas and sodas.
[
citation needed
]
In the 1990s, people thought that consumption had a style and preferred cafés with a neater interior design and professionalism in coffee. There was a huge shift in Korean café culture's history in 1999 when
Starbucks
, the first foreign franchise coffee shop in Korea, was established in Sinchon, Seoul. Starbucks introduced Korea to a new café culture, such as take-out and self-service system without good-looking waitresses and staying at a café alone reading a book or doing homework. Since then, more foreign franchise coffee shops entered the market with a greater variety of coffee and atmosphere, and more local franchise cafés and small private-owned cafés appeared with their unique features.
[2]
Coffee consumption
[
edit
]
As of 2015, there were an estimated 49,600 coffee shops in
South Korea
, and 17,000 coffee shops in Seoul, making Seoul's coffee-per-capita greater than that of
Seattle
or
San Francisco
. In 2013, it was estimated that around 657,000 tons of coffee were sold in South Korea, with a per capita coffee consumption of about 2.3 kg per person.
[1]
[5]
[6]
The instant coffee market makes up a large percentage of the total coffee consumption in Korea where many well-known brands compete for market share. Instant coffee technology like freeze-drying, which was the best method of preserving the flavor of coffee, was improved upon in Korea.
[4]
Where freeze-drying was stabilized for mass production.
[4]
As of 2003, instant coffee made up 90 percent of all the coffee consumed.
[4]
With the introduction of big coffee chains like Starbucks, in the late 1990s, the consumption of freshly brewed coffee increased.
[4]
Going to Starbucks to enjoy coffee became a way to engage with American and Western culture, hence many young and/or middle and upper-middle class Koreans began to frequent Starbucks.
[4]
Buddhism and coffee consumption
[
edit
]
Another group of Koreans who have increased their consumption of coffee are Korean Buddhist. In Korea today some major monasteries say that over half of the meditation monks have switched to coffee.
[7]
Making coffee and sharing it with visitors is also rationalized as a way for Buddhism to remain relevant in contemporary society.
[7]
The type of coffee normally associated with the Korean monastic community is hand-drip coffee.
[7]
That is because monks may want to be associated with Korean high-culture which is associated with hand-drip coffee.
[7]
Additionally, there are many tools and steps involved with hand-drip coffee which mirror the ceremony of making tea.
[7]
As an example of how the Korean Buddhist community has embraced coffee one can turn to the Puramsa, Torisa, and other monastic grounds where cafes were established.
[7]
Korean Culture and coffee consumption
[
edit
]
The most popular coffee among Koreans is Iced Americano, regardless of weather. Even in the cold winter, Koreans like to drink Iced Americano. AFP has mentioned, in winter the consumption of Iced Americano is greater than warm drinks.
[8]
For this particular coffee consumption, there's a new phrase created called ‘Eoljukah’ which means ‘iced coffee even if I freeze to death’. The reason that particular drink is popular is because of Korea's fast paced culture. Iced Americano comes out in a short amount of time compared to the other drinks so in fast-paced culture in Korea, most people prefer that drink. In 2019, Hyundai Research Lab found out that the individuals’ average yearly consumption of coffee is 353 cups, which is the rate that is twice higher than worldwide average.
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
Roasters
[
edit
]
The sudden influx of coffee shops have replaced the once traditional "
dabang
" which were common meetings places serving a selection of customary teas. In addition to large US chains that have profited from the surge in demand for coffee, local businesses and entrepreneurs have also seized the opportunities. As of 2014 South Korea boasted 17,000 coffee shops and the capital, Seoul, had more outlets of Starbucks than any other city in the world, even New York.
[12]
[5]
Starbucks
[
edit
]
A Starbucks in Seoul
Starbucks opened its first store in 1999 and since 2011 has been opening about 80 new premises a year. The strong association with the South Korean public and the US has helped make coffee desirable and with many Koreans associating coffee and Starbucks as a lifestyle choice, it has become a status symbol throughout Seoul. Landlords are eager to have the brand open up a store in their buildings to enhance their value, reputation and image.
However, not all new Starbucks locations were welcomed warmly. In 2001, Starbucks opened a store in Insa-dong overcoming fierce resistance from the neighborhood’s shop owners.
[4]
The locals opposed the plane to open Starbucks because it would taint the Insa-dong’s identity as the cradle of all Korean culture.
[4]
Shop owners also had practical concerns as they believed that Starbucks would lure away customers who visited the traditional teahouses in the area.
[4]
After numerous negotiations and compromises Starbucks opened their Insa-dong shop.
[4]
This shop is unique in that it is the only Starbucks with a Korean sign board and its windows have traditional wooden lattice patterns.
[4]
Inside the shop there are also several markers of traditional culture like wooden masks.
[4]
However, some Koreans remain cynical of the Insa-dong shop as they view Starbuck’s attempts as superficial and merely cosmetic with no real tribute to Korean culture.
[4]
Being the fourth largest market for Starbucks with 1,611 stores and almost 20,000 workers, the store is facing hardships in over working conditions. In January 2022, to draw attention, the workers drove around Seoul with the message "Partners' are your biggest asset." Through this Starbucks Korea pledged to hire 1,600 more workers for the stores.
[13]
Starbucks in Korea has started Siren Order, which is a service that makes online orders available. This has started in 2014, helping customers to order their drinks before their arrival, and picking them up as soon as they arrive. This service has led to nearly 5 million customers to register to the page.
[14]
As there is high rise in orders, Starbucks in the United States, as well as Canada, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom has added siren order to their service.
[15]
To reduce carbon footprint, Starbucks stores in South Korea will be eliminating all single-use cups by 2025.
[16]
Starbucks stores in Jeju Island will be leading this campaign by only using reusable cups in all 23 stores allocated in the island. The customers can either choose to use their own cups, or deposit 1000 won to use the reusable cups provided by the store. When the cup is returned, the deposit will be returned through cash, Starbucks card or HappyHabit Application points.  The reusable cups will be collected and cleaned up by a professional cleaner company, reducing the usage of single-use cups. The reusable cups will also be up-cycled to other forms as well.
[17]
Starbucks Korea has 870 cashless stores which is about 60% of the whole stores that are available in Korea. Due to this, there has been a reduction of people using cash from 4% in original stores to 0.5% in cashless stores. As there are more customers using cards and mobile apps, Starbucks has decided to reduce the amount of stores that use cash. However, for the elderlies and foreigners, they do accept cash in rare occasions. This is not only to apply the newest technology to the stores, but to apply the change of lifestyle, making it convenient for both the customers and partners.
[18]
Collaboration
[
edit
]
BTS has collaborated with Starbucks to help support the youth in South Korea. Starbucks prepared limited edition merchandise and beverages that have the same shade of purple reminiscent of a starry night, while playing one of BTS songs "Make It Right" in the store. Through this event, Starbucks raised funds to support The Beautiful Foundation.
[19]
Caffé Bene
[
edit
]
Caffe Bene
is a
coffeehouse chain
based in Seoul. It was founded in May 2008 by Sun-Kwon Kim, its chief executive officer. Caffè Bene is the largest
coffeehouse
in South Korea measured by number of stores. As of April 24, 2012, it had 760 outlets.
[20]
Initially Caffe Bene struggled to gain any traction in an oversaturated American market. Failing to gain brand recognition, Sun-Kwon Kim agreed a deal with a number of entertainment shows to use his coffee locations in a selection of TV shows for a 3% share in the companies profit.
