Sharifu Kiragga Tusuubira is a strong proponent for and an advocate of sickle cell and disability rights in Uganda. His advocacy started while at Makerere University, following a moment of personal heartbreak wherein a lady he was in love with rejected him because of sickle cell. This motivated Sharifu to get involved and change the status quo of how the sickle cell was viewed.
[15]
[2]
Sharifu has advocated for people living with sickle cell disease to have rights to independent thinking, participate freely in community activities or further Agency and enjoy the same privileges as the ‘normal’ people in Uganda.
[3]

Operation Murfreesboro
was one of the closing engagements of the
Battle of Ramadi
during the Iraq War and resulted in a decisive victory for the United States Forces over the Islamic State of Iraq. It is widely credited with breaking the back of the insurgency in Anbar Province, resulting in the Anbar province favoring the new Iraqi government in Baghdad.
The operation resulted from changes in the political alliance of the Sofia district of northeast Ar Ramadi, which had previously fought against U.S. forces. Due to attacks on civilians in the area by fighters with
Al Qaeda in Iraq
(
AQI
), a local sheikh allied with US forces in October 2006, and the US provided assistance establishing a local militia. That militia provided valuable assistance regarding enemy tactics and activities in the area.
Operation Murfreesboro began 20 February 2007, by setting up a full cordon around the Ma'Laab district, supported by armored vehicles, Apache helicopters, and long-range rockets (
GMLRS
). Able Company of the 9th Infantry provided security for 36 hours while a permanent concrete barrier was erected along "Easy Street", on the western border of the Ma'Laab district. These efforts resulted in heavy losses for the third platoon as they headed towards "Easy Street", clearing the houses along a street where an IED was believed to be hidden. The hidden IED detonated, resulting in several casualties, with subsequent difficulties evacuating wounded soldiers. This culminated in heroic actions by the Able company commander, who was awarded the Silver Star. In spite of these losses, the concrete barrier was completed in just 24 hours and the Ma'Laab district was largely pacified by mid-March, after the construction of multiple outposts in the neighborhood.

In October 2006, the
1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment
(1-9 IN) deployed to east
Ramadi
for the 2nd Brigade of the
2nd Infantry Division's
second tour to
Iraq
. The "Manchus" were replacing the
506th Infantry Regiment
(506 AR) from the
101st Airborne Division
, and the
1st Armored Division
(1 AD). Many soldiers of the new battalion had previously been in east Ramadi during a 2004-2005 deployment under the colors of the
503rd Infantry Regiment
(1-503 IN), thus giving the Americans a slight advantage in that many of the battalion's
non-commissioned officers
were already familiar with the terrain.
During the summer of 2006, a local sheikh in the Sofia district of northeast Ar Ramadi began to grow weary of the attacks on civilians in the area carried out by foreign fighters sent by
Al Qaeda in Iraq
(
AQI
) and other terror groups.  These attacks culminated in the murder of the sheikh's brother on 21 August.  In October he sent word to the newly arrived 9th Infantry Regiment's leadership, saying that in exchange for US and Iraqi Army support, he would convert his local militia (most of whom had fought against the battalion during its previous deployment in 2004) into Iraqi police, and he would encourage other local leaders to do the same.
Iraqi militia checkpoint in Sofia
In mid-October 2006, al-Qaeda announced the creation of
Islamic state of Iraq
(ISI),
[1]
replacing the
Mujahideen Shura Council
(MSC) and its
al-Qaeda in Iraq
(AQI).
Under the arrangement, the Sofia militia agreed not to attack US forces or launch mortars at any American
FOB
, and 1-9's battalion commander agreed to help form a militia by supplying uniforms, vehicles, food, water, weapons, and training, as well as assist the sheikh with civil affairs in his area.  To accomplish this, on 4 December 2007, Able and Baker companies from 1-9 were deployed to the Sofia area, along with several companies of the Iraqi Army, to assist the battalion's Charlie company, which had been operating in the area for the preceding month and a half.  Despite the heavy American presence, fighting continued against Al Qaeda forces in the area, and the Sheikhs proved their worth by providing the Americans with information on the locations and movements of terrorists and
Mujahideen
in the area, leading to heavy losses being suffered by the Al Qaeda backed opposition forces.  While living and operating with the local militia, the soldiers of the 9th Infantry were able to learn about their enemy's tactics and activities in the area.  This knowledge would prove crucial during the upcoming operations.
Operation Murfreesboro
[

]
U.S. Army soldiers during Operation Murfreesboro.
This operation was one of the closing engagements of the
Battle of Ramadi
in 2006. In the beginning months of 2007, Task Force 1-9, composed of
1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment
(1-9 IN, part of
2ID
), with support from Abrams main battle tanks, Bradley IFVs and dismounted infantry from
B/C/D Company of 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment
(3-69 AR),
Navy SEALS
, Bradley IFVs and dismounted infantry from
1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment
(1-26 IN), Charlie Company of the 321st Engineer Battalion, Lima Company of
3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment
(3/6 Marines), Fox Company of
2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment
(2/4 Marines), 504th Military Intelligence unit and infantrymen from the veteran 1/1/1
Iraqi Army
, launched an offensive in East Ramadi named Operation Murfreesboro.
The operation was intended to cut off the Ma'Laab district from the rest of Ramadi in order to drive out the Al Queda forces operating with near impunity there.  The operation began 20 February 2007, when tanks and IFVs from 3-69th Armor and 1-26th Infantry set up a full cordon around the Ma'Laab district, preventing any movement in or out of the neighborhood. Once this was in place, the soldiers of the 9th Infantry Regiment began conducting clearing operations and targeted raids searching for weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), enemy fighters, and high level Al Qaeda leadership (HVTs) within the Ma'Laab and the neighboring Iskaan district, supported by the aforementioned armored vehicles, Apache helicopters, and long range rockets (
GMLRS
).
Blacksheep Alley and the Barrier Operation
[
edit
]
Plans were then made to set up a permanent concrete barrier along "Easy Street", which formed the western border of the Ma'Laab district.  As the area was still very dangerous, security had to be set in place to protect the Task Force 1-9 soldiers erecting the concrete barriers, and Able Company of the 9th Infantry was tasked with providing that security.  Shortly before midnight on 24 February, 3rd Platoon of Able Company departed from an American outpost on the north end of the Ma'Laab, known as Outpost Hotel, and headed towards its objective on Easy Street, where it would provide security for 36 hours while the concrete barriers were erected.
Outpost Hotel shortly after closing in late 2007
Immediately after departing the outpost, the men of 3rd Platoon discovered they were being observed by enemy fighters on the rooftops of buildings around them.  Upon reaching an intersection where IEDs had been discovered the previous three consecutive nights, a Marine Corps bomb-sniffing dog was sent ahead to scout the intersection.  The dog indicated twice that there was an IED hidden further down the street, and this was reported to the commander of Able Company.  Via radio, the leader of 3rd Platoon requested permission to take a different route, but was instead ordered by Able Company's commander to proceed down the street where the IED was known to be hidden.  3rd Platoon reiterated the request, but was again ordered to proceed down the street after being told by the company commander that, "You are infantry, you move to contact".
Following orders, the platoon moved down the street, and began clearing the houses along the street where the IED was hidden, hoping to find the "trigger-man" whose job it was to detonate the IED.  As one squad of the platoon was preparing to enter a house, the hidden IED detonated in the wall next to them, resulting in seven Americans and one Iraqi soldier being severely injured, including three American soldiers who lost at least one leg apiece in the blast.  Faced with sudden 30% losses to the platoon, the remaining soldiers were overwhelmed with the tasks of providing first aid to their fallen comrades, and pulling security against further enemy attacks.  The platoon had a mere 23 men to begin with, six of which had been sent immediately from basic training just one week prior, and the remaining soldiers resorted to having the less wounded soldiers assist in setting up a defensive perimeter while the remainder treated their more severely wounded comrades.
Able Company, 1/9th Infantry Regiment in late 2007
After the CASEVAC element departed, the remaining sixteen soldiers in 3rd Platoon were contacted by their company commander, again via radio, and were ordered to continue their mission, a heroic action for which the company commander was later awarded a
Silver Star
.  Reaching their objective twenty minutes later, the remainder of 3rd Platoon began setting up their outpost for the 36-hour barrier operation, while the rest of Able Company began doing the same at other locations along Easy Street, all while under the protective cover of the tanks and Bradleys already there.
Just before dawn, 3rd Platoon suffered further casualties when, while hanging camouflage netting on a rooftop, one of their non-commissioned officers was shot in the neck by an Al Qaeda fighter.  The soldier then fell three stories, resulting in severe injuries that left the soldier paralyzed from the neck down.
Despite these heavy losses, Task Force 1-9 pushed forward, and completed the construction of the permanent barrier in just 25 hours, well short of the expected 36.  After a short refit, Able Company was back in the Ma'Laab district just 14 hours later, when they began the construction of permanent outposts within the neighborhood.  By mid-March, the Ma'Laab had been largely pacified.  Bolstered by new Iraqi police recruits and a permanent Iraqi Army presence, Able Company continued operating in the area out of four separate bases shared with the Iraqi army and police, all evenly spread throughout the district.  This allowed the remainder of Task Force 1-9 to focus its attention on the surrounding neighborhoods.
Aftermath
[
edit
]
Throughout the month of February, there were more than 40 separate engagements with Al Qaeda forces, 8 large weapons caches found, more than 20
IEDs
used against US and Iraqi Army forces, more than 50 IEDs located and safely disposed of, 69 enemy fighters killed in action, 9 known enemy wounded, and 32 enemy fighters captured.  Together with the Iraqi Army, the local police force began to conduct patrols with gradually lessened support from coalition forces.  This led to the peaceful summer months of 2007, during which no attacks of any type took place.
Captured insurgents
Operation Murfreesboro is widely credited with breaking the back of the insurgency in Anbar Province, as it fed the fire of the
Anbar Awakening
, which saw almost the entirety of Anbar province turn on the insurgency, in favor of the new Iraqi government in Baghdad.  Coupled with further gains in recruiting the local leaders and militias in the surrounding areas, Anbar Province required very little assistance during the famous "surge" that took place later in 2007.  The improvement was so great that it enabled Task Force 1-9 (now operating without the armored and mechanized support it had enjoyed earlier in the year) to send nearly 70% of its strength to assist other units in clearing the city of Taji, just north of Baghdad, in October 2007.
The 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment received the
Navy Unit Commendation
for its work in east Ramadi, and has also been recommended for a
Valorous Unit Award
.

Attempt to redefine economics
The
welfare definition of economics
is an attempt by
Alfred Marshall
, a pioneer of
neoclassical economics
, to redefine his field of study. This definition expands the field of economic science to a larger study of humanity. Specifically, Marshall's view is that economics studies all the actions that people take in order to achieve economic welfare. In the words of Marshall, "man earns money to get material welfare."  Others since Marshall have described his remark as the "welfare definition" of economics. This definition enlarged the scope of economic science by emphasizing the study of wealth and humanity together, rather than wealth alone.
In his widely read textbook,
Principles of Economics
, published in 1890, Marshall defines economics as follows:
Political Economy or Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well-being.
[1]
Functions
[
edit
]
The following are the implications of this definition:
Economics
is a study of humankind.
Human life has several aspects: social, religious, economic and political—but economics is concerned only with the economic aspect of life.
Promotion of welfare is the ultimate goal, but the term welfare is used in a narrow sense to meet material welfare only.
[2]
According to
Edwin Cannan
, "the aim of political economy or Economics is the explanation of the general causes on which the material welfare of human beings depend".
Marshall clearly explains that economic activity is different from other activity. For example,
If a student visits a friend who is ill, it is a
social
activity,
If a person give his vote in an election, it is a
political
activity.
If a person goes to church/temple it is a
religious
activity.
[3]
Marshall defines economic activity as separate from the above activities. A farmer who toils in the field, or a worker on an assembly, are performing an economic activity: they work to increase their material welfare (primarily by earning
money
). Money buys goods or services that satisfy wants. In other words, economics deals with effort, wants, and the satisfaction of those wants.
Impact on economics
[
edit
]
Followers in the neoclassical tradition, such as
William Beveridge
and
Arthur Pigou
have continued to define economics in terms of material economic welfare. According to Pigou, "the range of enquiry becomes restricted to that part of social welfare that can be brought directly or indirectly into relation with the
measuring rod
of
money
".
[4]
Criticism
[
edit
]
Marshall’s definition has been criticized by more recent economists, including
Lionel Robbins
. Robbins' criticisms include:
(1)Narrows down the scope of economics. Marshall distinguishes between material and non-material welfare, and confines economics to the study of material welfare. Robbins feels that economists should r attention to material welfare. There are things that are "non-material" but they promote human welfare. Robbins cites “the services of doctors, lawyers, teachers, dancers, engineers, professors". These goods "satisfy our wants and are scarce in supply”.
[5]
Some economists feel that Marshall's definition of "material" includes both goods and services, and that Robbins is either misreading Marshall's text, or creating a
straw man
argument.
[6]
(2) Assumes equivalency between welfare and economic activity. For Robbins, there are economic activities which do not promote human welfare. For example, the sale of
cocaine
or
heroin
. Here Robbins says, “Why talk of welfare at all? Why not throw away the mask altogether”.
(3) It is a vague concept. According to Robbins, “welfare” is a vague concept to use to define economics because it is subjective. Economics is a quantitative science; but welfare cannot be quantitatively measured, and two persons cannot agree on what creates or improves welfare.
(4) It involves value judgement. Finally the word “welfare” in Marshall’s definition brings
economics
to the realm of ethics. Robbins would prefer that economics remain neutral in assessing the results of economic transactions..
Economic welfare
[
edit
]
Broadly,
economic welfare
is the level of prosperity and
standard of living
of either an individual or a group of persons. In the field of
economics
, it specifically refers to
utility
gained through the achievement of material
goods and services
. In other words, it refers to that part of social
welfare
that can be fulfilled through economic activity.
[7]
According to Roefie Hueting, welfare is dependent on factors like employment,
income distribution
, labour conditions, leisure time, production and the scarce possible uses of the environmental functions.
[8]
Economic welfare is measured in different ways, depending on the preferences of those measuring it. Factors used to measure the economic welfare of a population, include:
GDP
,
literacy
, access to health care, and assessments of
environmental
quality.

Epitiostanol
, sold under the brand name
Thiodrol
, is an
injected
antiestrogen
and
anabolic-androgenic steroid
(AAS) of the
dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) group which was described in the literature in 1965 and has been marketed in
Japan
as an
antineoplastic agent
for the treatment of
breast cancer
since 1977.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
Medical uses
[
edit
]
Epitiostanol is used as an antiestrogen and antineoplastic agent in the treatment of breast cancer.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
It has also been found to be effective in the treatment of
gynecomastia
.

[7]
Side effects
[
edit
]
See also:
Anabolic steroid § Adverse effects
A
prodrug
of epitiostanol,
mepitiostane
, which is also marketed for the treatment of breast cancer, is reported to show a high rate of
virilizing
side effects
such as
acne
,
hirsutism
, and
voice changes
in women.
[8]
Pharmacology
[
edit
]
Pharmacodynamics
[
edit
]
Epitiostanol binds directly to the
androgen receptor
(AR) and
estrogen receptor
(ER), where it acts as an
agonist
and
antagonist
, respectively.
[3]
[5]
[9]
[10]
It is described as
potent
in its activity as an antiestrogen and comparatively weak as an AAS.
[7]
In any case, in terms of AAS
potency
, epitiostanol has been found to have 11 times the
anabolic
activity and approximately equal
androgenic
activity relative to that of the reference AAS
methyltestosterone
.
[11]
The
mechanism of action
of epitiostanol in breast cancer is multimodal; it directly suppresses tumor growth through activation of the AR and inhibition of the ER, and, in
premenopausal
women, it additionally acts as an
antigonadotropin
and reducing systemic
estrogen
levels via AR activation and consequent suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis
.
[5]
[12]
Epitiostanol is unique among AAS in acting as an antagonist of the ER.
[

Pharmacokinetics
[
edit
]
Similarly to the case of
testosterone
, epitiostanol shows poor
bioavailability
and weak therapeutic efficacy when taken
orally
due to extensive
first-pass metabolism
.
[13]
As such, it must instead be administered via
intramuscular injection
.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero
, known as
Zero no Kiseki
[a]
in Japan, is a 2010
role-playing video game
developed by
Nihon Falcom
. The game is a part of the
Trails
series, itself a part of the larger
The Legend of Heroes
series. It takes place in Crossbell, a city-state located between two great powers fighting for control over it, and follows Lloyd Bannings and his colleagues Elie MacDowell, Randy Orlando, and Tio Plato. The four form the Special Support Section, a newly formed department of the Crossbell police. The game and its 2011 sequel,
Trails to Azure
, form the
Crossbell arc
of the series.
Trails from Zero
was first released in Japan for the
PlayStation Portable
before being ported to
Windows
for release in China in 2011. An enhanced port featuring improved visuals and additional
voice acting
was released for the
PlayStation Vita
in Japan as
Zero no Kiseki: Evolution
in 2012. The game received an English
fan translation
in 2020, which
NIS America
used as a base for an official version that was released for
Nintendo Switch
,
PlayStation 4
, and
Windows
in September 2022.
Plot
[
edit
]
Trails from Zero
is set three months after the end of
The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd
, in the city-state of Crossbell. Uneasily situated between two great powers - the Erebonian Empire and the Calvard Republic, both of which claim sovereignty over Crossbell - the city is riven by political tensions, corruption and organized crime.
The protagonist, Lloyd Bannings, is a rookie police detective. At the beginning of
Zero
, he is assigned to the Special Support Section (SSS), an odd-jobs branch of the city's police department, together with Elie MacDowell, heiress to a political dynasty, Randolph "Randy" Orlando, a laid-back ex-soldier, and Tio Plato, a young girl and electronics genius. During
Zero
, the SSS investigate the schemes of the city's competing crime syndicates, before stumbling over the plot of the centuries-old D∴G cult to raise a young girl, known as KeA, to godhood by turning her into the "True Goddess" known as Demiourgos and through her, overthrow the continent's church and faith. The SSS defeat and arrest the cult's leaders and assume guardianship of KeA.
Development
[
edit
]
Trails from Zero
was first released in Japan for the
PlayStation Portable
and was later ported to
Windows
for release in China in 2011.
[1]
It was also released for the
PlayStation Vita
in Japan as
Zero no Kiseki: Evolution
in October 2012. This version features improved visuals and more
voice acting
.
[2]
The
Evolution
version received a remaster for the
PlayStation 4
, releasing in Japan as
Zero no Kiseki Kai
in April 2020.
[3]
It was also released for the
Nintendo Switch
in China and South Korea by Clouded Leopard Entertainment on February 25, 2021.
[4]
Due to a variety of reasons,
Trails from Zero
and its sequel,
Trails to Azure
, were not localized outside of Japan by the time of the Japanese release of
Trails of Cold Steel
. Falcom subsequently approached
Xseed Games
, who had previously localized
Trails in the Sky
, and requested that a localization of
Trails of Cold Steel
be prioritized instead, resulting in
Trails from Zero
and
Trails to Azure
being skipped.
[5]
An English
fan translation
was released by a team known as "Geofront" in March 2020.
[6]
An official English version by
NIS America
, using this as the base of the translation, was released for
Nintendo Switch

PlayStation 4
, and
Windows
in North America on September 27, 2022, in Europe on September 30, 2022, and in Australasia on October 10, 2022.

The
Battle of Prek Klok I
occurred on February 28, 1967 during
Operation Junction City
, a
search and destroy
mission by American military forces in
Tay Ninh Province
of
South Vietnam
, to the west of the capital
Saigon
. A few days before the battle, the
1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment
was brought into the area near
Suoi Da
and
Prek Klok
to defend a highway, airfield, and artillery base in the area, and to carry out search and destroy operations around it. On the morning of 28 February, elements of the battalion headed east, and were attacked from the front by
Viet Cong
(VC) infantry with gunfire, rockets and mortars. Soon after, they were attacked from all fronts as the VC tried to surround them with a battalion-sized force. However, with superior firepower available, the Americans called in air strikes and artillery, and by mid afternoon, had repelled the VC attacks. The Americans lost 25 killed while the VC lost 167.
Background
[
edit
]
The 1/16th Infantry, was brought into Operation Junction City on February 23 when it was airlifted from its base at
Lai Khe
, southwest to
Suoi Da
. There it assumed the mission that had belonged to the
2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment
, of being the reserve for the 3rd Brigade; it also was assigned its portion of the Suoi Da defenses. In the early morning of February 24 the battalion area received approximately 120 rounds of 82-mm. mortar, all within a few minutes; two were killed, including a company commander, and five wounded. Six hours later the battalion was airlifted to positions along Route 4 north of Suoi Da and, after considerable jungle clearing, went into a night defensive position on the east side of the road, six kilometers south of Prek Klok, the location of an artillery base defended by the
2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment
, where an airfield and a Special Forces camp were being built. The mission of the battalion was to secure the road in its assigned sector and to engage in search and destroy operations.
[1]
The 1/16th Infantry was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rufus C. Lazzell. He had commanded the battalion in mid-1966 for about a month before he was wounded in July by a bullet wound to the elbow, which required him to be evacuated to the US; upon his return to Vietnam in November 1966, General
William DePuy
restored him to command of his old unit.
[1]
On 25 February, the battalion suffered several friendly fire incidents. One of the unit's 81-mm. mortar rounds fell short of their intended target and landed near soldiers of the unit, injuring two. Later in the day, their position was hit by .50-caliber machine gun rounds from an Allied mechanized unit conducting
reconnaissance by fire
during the period immediately after sunset, luckily the only damage was to an 81-mm. mortar.
[1]
The next two days were rather uneventful.
[1]

Battle
[
edit
]
At 08:00 on 28 February, Company B, 1/16th Infantry, departed its overnight defensive position located along Route 4 and moved east on a search and destroy mission. Two and a half kilometers ahead was the Prek Klok stream, a destination they would never reach.
[1]
: 113
Commanded by Captain Donald S. Ulm, Company B made very slow progress through the thick and tangled jungle in two columns with the 3rd Platoon in the lead, followed by the 2nd and 1st Platoons. Ulm's command element was located between the 2nd and 1st Platoons.
[1]
: 113
As the company progressed, the jungle thinned somewhat and the primary obstacle to the Americans became the fallen trees and brush-deadfall-which was encountered at 50- to 75-meter intervals. The company employed patrols in a cloverleaf pattern as they advanced. Two of these patterns had been completed by the time Company B progressed a little over one kilometer from its starting point.
[1]
: 114
At 10:30 the lead element of the 3rd Platoon received small arms and automatic weapons fire from a frontal direction, which was initially thought to be a company-size unit, but when Ulm learned that three machine guns had been observed, he correctly concluded that the VC were considerably more numerous. The VC were well concealed, but not dug in and thus not fully prepared for the ensuing battle.
[1]
: 114
The 3rd Platoon, still in the lead, continued to receive heavy fire and was unable to gain the upper hand. Then the platoon reported being attacked on its right (south) flank as well as from the front (east).
[1]
: 114
In accordance with division policy, artillery marching fire had been preceding the company as it moved east; it was being fired by the 105mm guns of the
2nd Battalion, 33rd Artillery Regiment
, located at Artillery Base II at Prek Klok. As soon as contact was made the artillery forward observer ordered the shells to be trained on the VC position. Within minutes one of the command and control
Huey helicopters
of the division was flying above the battle scene and in touch with both the division tactical operations center and, in the absence of the brigade and battalion commanders, the company on the ground. The tactical operations center was alerted to get a forward air controller airborne over the area and to be prepared to get air strikes into the area once every fifteen minutes. Since the enemy was not dug in, the ordnance requested was
cluster bombs
, delivered almost at treetop level with a bursting radius of 30 meters. They could be delivered very close to friendly units and were highly lethal against troops in the open, even in the jungle.
[1]
: 114
Captain Ulm was asked to mark the position of his troops on the ground with colored smoke and to give the disposition of his company with respect to the smoke.
[1]
: 114
It was quickly apparent to the airborne observer that the artillery (now supported by a battery of 155-mm. howitzers at Artillery Base I) had to be shifted if it were to be effective, and this was done so.
[1]
: 116
Twenty minutes after the start of the battle, the VC attacked from the northeast, and contact was lost between the 3rd Platoon and the company command. Captain Ulm theorized that the 3rd Platoon and possibly the 2nd Platoon would be flanked from the direction of the renewed attack and directed the 1st Platoon to move to the left flank of the 3rd Platoon. As the men moved into position the entire company area was hit by small arms fire,
rifle grenades
, rockets, and 60-mm. mortar rounds. The firing was intense, but it resulted in few friendly casualties. The 2nd Platoon moved to the right.
[1]
: 116
At 12:30 radio contact was re-established with the 3rd Platoon. Captain Ulm learned that the company was in an arc-shaped formation with the 3rd Platoon in the center, 2nd on the right, and 1st on the left (north). From this information the airborne observer was better able to picture the situation on the ground and adjust the artillery and air strikes accordingly. As each flight arrived over the target and its ordnance was determined, Captain Ulm was asked to name the desired location. Each time, a colored
smoke grenade
was thrown by the unit on the ground, and the strike was brought in with relation to the smoke as desired. Ulm noted that much of the automatic weapons and small arms fire came from the trees and that it was extremely accurate, so he ordered his company to concentrate on the well-camouflaged and concealed snipers in the trees.
[1]
: 116
At approximately 13:00 the 2nd Platoon detected movement to the west, and it appeared that the VC were attempting to encircle the American company and attack the open (west) end of the perimeter. To counter this, a fire team from the 1st Platoon was moved to the northwest and a squad from the 2nd Platoon was moved to the southwest. As the squad from the 2nd Platoon moved into position, it received heavy automatic weapons fire from the trees. They returned fire and called in artillery on the western side of the company.
[1]
: 116
Air strikes continued to be directed by the commander on the ground. Air strikes and artillery were being called in within 30 meters of the American positions in order to hit the VC in close proximity. By 14:00 the battle had subsided into sniper fire, and by 15:00 it had ended, mainly due to the 54 sorties of the Tactical Air Command and intensive artillery fire.
[1]
: 116
In the meantime Colonel Marks, the brigade commander, at 14:30 brought another company of the 1st Battalion into a landing zone some 600 meters to the northeast of the point of contact following the firing of preparatory fires around the zone. Upon landing one soldier was wounded by small arms fire. A second company from another battalion nearby was lifted into the landing zone immediately after the first had secured it; this second company was dispatched to assist Captain Ulm's men. By 16:45 a third company of the 1st Battalion, had landed to assist in securing the landing zone and in evacuating the dead and wounded there.
[1]
: 116
At 21:30 Captain Ulm and his company, assisted by the relieving company, reached the landing zone with their 25 dead and 28 wounded. Two sweeps of the area by the relieving company that evening and the following morning revealed 167 VC dead and 40 weapons captured or destroyed. One of the prisoners captured in the area the morning after was the assistant commander of a company in the
People's Army of Vietnam
2nd Battalion, 101st Regiment of the VC 9th Division. It was this battalion that had encountered Company B. It appeared that they had been heading towards Route 4 to attack the U.S. convoys traveling between Suoi Da and
Katum Camp
. The next morning Company B was evacuated by helicopter to Suoi Da to be refitted and receive replacements. They were again in battle five days later.
[1]
: 116
Aftermath
[
edit
]
As a result of the battle, Platoon Sergeant
Matthew Leonard
was posthumously awarded the
Medal of Honor
. After his platoon leader had been wounded at the start of the battle, Leonard organized the platoon defensive position, redistributed ammunition, and took control. While helping a wounded soldier to safety, he was hit in the hand by a sniper, but continued to fight instead of stopping to receive medical attention. Under cover of the main attack from the northeast, the communists moved a machine gun into a location where it could sweep the entire position of Leonard's platoon. Leonard charged the gun, and destroyed its crew despite being hit several times by enemy fire. He was eventually killed in this act.

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Karl Rappan
(26 September 1905 - 2 January 1996) was an Austrian
footballer
and
coach
. He played and managed mostly in Switzerland, where he won multiple titles. He had four tenures as coach of the
Switzerland national team
, which he managed in three
World Cups
, and is the all-time leader in matches won as coach of the Swiss team. He introduced a major football strategy known as the "bolt", which gave origin to the
catenaccio
system. He also helped create the
UEFA Intertoto Cup
.
Playing career
[
edit
]
Rappan, born in
Vienna
, played as a
half
and
forward
.
[1]
As a teenager, he played for the club
Donau Wien
. In 1924, he joined
Wacker Vienna
, where he played four years. He was selected to the
Austria national team
in while at Wacker. He then played one season at each of the clubs
FK Austria Wien
and
Rapid Wien
, winning the 1929-30 Austrian league with the latter. Rappan then moved to Switzerland, where he started playing for
Servette FC
in 1931, becoming a player-coach until his retirement as a player in 1935, and winning the Swiss league twice with the club, in 1933 and 1934.
In 1927, he was
capped
twice for the Austria national team, scoring one goal,
[2]
against
Hungary
in a 6-0 win.
[3]
Coaching career
[
edit
]
Rappan spent almost all of his managerial career - which extended from 1932 to 1963 - coaching Swiss teams and the Switzerland national team. After his role as player-coach at Servette, Rappan became a full-time coach and joined
Grasshopper Club Zürich
, managing the
Zürich
club from 1935 to 1948, and winning five domestic league titles and seven cups. In 1948, he returned to Servette for a second period at the club, now as coach only. He remained there until 1957, adding one more league title and one cup to his palmares.
After Servette, Rappan had a one-season spell at FC Zürich. From 1960 to 1963, he coached the Switzerland national team exclusively, and after this last period in charge of the national squad, he joined club
Lausanne-Sport
, being their coach from 1964 to 1968, and winning one league title in 1965. After almost four decades of service in Swiss football, he returned to Austria to be the technical director of
Rapid Wien
- his former club as a player - for the 1969-70 season.
[2]
The "bolt"
[
edit
]
During the early 1930s, when the use of the
"WM" system
was spreading, Rappan developed a tactical system under which players switched positions and duties depending on the game's pattern.
[4]
The system varied largely from the classic
2-3-5 formation
and the WM, focusing in defense. The team would fold back into its own half and wait for the opponent's attack, conceding possession of the midfield. The system received the name of
verrou
or "bolt". It has also been called "Swiss bolt". Reportedly, Rappan looked for a system that was less rigid and less dependent on individual talent than the WM. It relied on collective work, and gave the amateurs of the time a chance to compensate to some extent for their lack of skill.
[5]
The defensive strategy of the bolt relied on a mixture of zonal and man-marking. It was the first system to play four players in defense, using one of them as a "security bolt" supporting the other three.
[4]
It is acknowledged that the bolt largely influenced the
catenaccio
(Italian for
bolt
) and its use of the
libero
(sweeper) in defense.
Rappan's system was never fully understood by many people at the time, and the coach himself never discussed it, keeping a certain mystery around it. It received both praise and criticism. The system did demonstrate to be successful at the
1938 World Cup
. Switzerland eliminated
Germany
in the first round, where the match that ended in a 1-1 draw was replayed, with the Swiss winning the second match 4-2. Two weeks prior to the World Cup, Switzerland had defeated
England
in a friendly match.
Switzerland national team
[
edit
]
Rappan had four different tenures as head coach of the
Switzerland national team
: 1937 to 1938, 1942 to 1949, 1953 to 1954, and 1960 to 1963. He managed Switzerland in 77 international matches, the most ever by any Swiss team coach. He won 29 matches, also a record, and lost 36 times, second-most all-time.
[6]
[7]
With Rappan as its coach, Switzerland qualified to the World Cups of
1938
,
1954
(where they beat
Italy
and lost 7-5 to Austria in quarterfinals), and
1962
. Rappan recorded three wins, one draw, and six losses as a coach in World Cup finals tournaments.
His last match as Switzerland's coach was on 11 November 1963 against
France
in
Paris
, a 2-2 draw.
After retirement
[
edit
]
Rappan, who had the idea of creating a European league, helped Ernst Thommen, the Managing Director for the Swiss Football Pool, conceive the
UEFA Intertoto Cup
, which started in 1961.
[8]
[9]
Rappan died on 2 January 1996 in
Bern

Painting by the museum art curator
Wybrand Hendriks
in 1800 of the famous Oval Room in Teyler's Museum, showing the
elektriseermachine
of
Martin van Marum
Leendert Viervant,
Design for the Oval Room of
Teylers Museum
; 480 x 600 mm.
Leendert Viervant de Jonge
(Leendert Viervant the Younger) (
Arnhem
, 5 March 1752 - 4 July 1801,
Amsterdam
),
[1]
was a Dutch
architect
and cabinet builder.
Viervant stemmed from a family of architects,
[2]
cabinet builders and stonemasons. His father,
Hendrik Viervant
, was the son of cabinet builder and stonemason
Leendert Viervant the Elder
and married Catharina Maria Otten, the sister of the
neoclassical
architect
Jacob Otten Husly
. Also Hendrik's brother,
Anthonie Viervant
, was a cabinet maker and Anthonie's son
Roelof Viervant
designed garden pavillons and
facades
. All these family members have designed some buildings in 18th century Netherlands.
[3]
Thanks to his family background, Viervant had a good basis to work from. Born and raised in the provincial city of Arnhem, he studied to become an architect with his uncle Husly. In 1768 he was entered into the stonemason guild of Amsterdam,
[1]
where he lived and worked. He lived at the
Amstel
and later near
Hoge Sluis
(1784-1790). In 1791 he was forced to let his inventory be liquidated, because he couldn't fulfill his financial obligations any longer - finally he was able to come to arrangements with his
creditors
. According to his uncle Husly, Viervant couldn't handle money, and he lived a wild life.
[4]
In 1798 he became one of the three directors at the
City and Public Works Department
of the City Amsterdam, after his predecessor had to leave because of his support of the Orange family (this was between the revolution and the inclusion in the French Empire).

The
town hall of Weesp
, one of Leendert Viervant the Younger's designs
Viervant was the architect of several buildings throughout the Netherlands. He was taught by his uncle Husly, and had a for that period typical neoclassical style. Short after his entry in the stonemason guild of Amsterdam in 1768, he got an assignment by the churchmasters of the
Oude Kerk
(
Old Church
) for a '
Bardiglio Marmere schoosteenmantel met holle stijlen en ornament in het midden voor f 180
(a
Bardiglio
marmer chimney mantel with hollow styles and an ornament in the middle for 180
guilders
). From 1772 to 1776 he worked on the
town hall
of
Weesp
. In 1779 he is asked by the
Teylers Stichting
to design the
Oval Room
, the
Teylers astronomical observatory
and a significant part of the interior of the
Teylers Museum
(works began in 1784). Here he could also use his family background of cabinet makers, designing amongst others the cabinets in the Oval Room and the lower part of the
Big Electrostatic generator
. In his works on the Teylers Museum, he based himself amongst others on work of the architects
François de Neufforge
,
Michelangelo
and
Artus Quellinus
. Viervant received some 9500
guilders
, and was with that amount probably one of the best paid architects in the Netherlands at the time. His uncle Husly designed several of the ceiling decorations in the Oval Room. He also works on other projects for this foundation, including the
Teylers Hofje
, all in
Haarlem
.
[5]
In the Regents' Room of
Teylers Hofje
, there is a large group portrait by
Wybrand Hendriks
, showing the first five Directors of
Teylers Stichting
sitting around a table, together with their accountant Koenraad Hovens and their architect: Leendert Viervant.
In 1787 he designed the current
Kalverstraat 8
for the patriotic society, but the building was stopped soon because the society was abolished. This does however show his involvement with the patriotic circles, which would later make him director of the City and Public Works Department.
[2]
[6]
Also Viervant is believed to be the designer of the south entrance of the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam.

A
reconnaissance satellite
or
intelligence satellite
(commonly, although unofficially, referred to as a
spy satellite
) is an
Earth observation satellite
or
communications satellite
deployed for
military
or
intelligence
applications.
The first generation type (i.e.,
Corona
[1]
[2]
and
Zenit
) took photographs, then ejected canisters of
photographic film
which would descend back down into Earth's atmosphere. Corona capsules were
retrieved in mid-air
as they floated down on
parachutes
. Later, spacecraft had digital imaging systems and downloaded the images via
encrypted
radio links.
In the United States, most information available about reconnaissance satellites is on programs that existed up to 1972, as this information has been
declassified
due to its age. Some information about programs before that time is still
classified information
, and a small amount of information is available on subsequent missions.
A few up-to-date reconnaissance satellite images have been declassified on occasion, or leaked, as in the case of
KH-11
photographs which were sent to
Jane's Defence Weekly
in 1984.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
On 16 March 1955, the
United States Air Force
officially ordered the development of an advanced reconnaissance satellite to provide continuous surveillance of "preselected areas of the Earth" in order "to determine the status of a potential enemy’s war-making capability".
[4]

Missions
[

Examples of reconnaissance satellite missions:
High resolution photography (
IMINT
)
Measurement and Signature Intelligence (
MASINT
)
Communications eavesdropping (
SIGINT
)
Covert communications
Monitoring of
nuclear test ban
compliance (see
National Technical Means
)
Detection of missile launches
On 28 August 2013, it was thought that "a $1-billion high-powered spy satellite capable of snapping pictures detailed enough to distinguish the make and model of an automobile hundreds of miles below"
[7]
was launched from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base using a Delta IV Heavy launcher, America's highest-payload space launch vehicle at the time.
On 17 February 2014, a Russian Kosmos-1220 originally launched in 1980 and used for naval missile targeting until 1982, made an uncontrolled
atmospheric entry
.
[8]
Benefits
[
edit
]
During the 1950s, a Soviet hoax had led to American fears of a
bomber gap
. In 1968, after gaining satellite photography, the United States' intelligence agencies were able to state with certainty that "No new
ICBM
complexes have been established in the USSR during the past year". President
Lyndon B. Johnson
told a gathering in 1967:
[9]
I wouldn't want to be quoted on this ... We've spent $35 or $40 billion on the space program. And if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge that we gained from space photography, it would be worth ten times what the whole program has cost. Because tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has and, it turned out,
our guesses were way off
. We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor.
During his
1980 State of the Union Address
, President
Jimmy Carter
explained how all of humanity benefited from the presence of American spy satellites:
[10]
...photo-reconnaissance satellites, for example, are enormously important in stabilizing world affairs and thereby make a significant contribution to the security of all nations.
Reconnaissance satellites have been used to enforce human rights, through the
Satellite Sentinel Project
, which monitors atrocities in
Sudan
and
South Sudan
.
Additionally, companies such as
GeoEye
and
DigitalGlobe
have provided commercial satellite imagery in support of natural disaster response and humanitarian missions.
[11]
In fiction
[
edit
]
Spy satellites are commonly seen in
spy fiction
and
military fiction
. Some works of fiction that focus specifically on spy satellites include:
The OMAC Project
Enemy of the State
Body of Lies
Ice Station Zebra
Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran
Patriot Games

Theretra manilae
is a
moth
of the  family
Sphingidae
. It is known from the
Philippines
.
The
wingspan
is 71-75 mm. It resembles a small, deeper green
Theretra rhesus
but the forewings are shorter and squarer and the outer margin is less convex. The green colour is often replaced by brown, probably as a result of the influence of high humidity. The inner margins of the tegulae are silver. The fifth and sixth postmedian lines on the forewing upperside run parallel over the posterior half of the wing and are only narrowly separated on the inner margin, the area between them is beige. The submarginal line lacks conspicuous vein dots.

Charles Fleetwood
,
c.
1618 to 4 October 1692, was an
English
lawyer from
Northamptonshire
, who served with the
Parliamentarian
army during the
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
. A close associate of
Oliver Cromwell
, to whom he was related by marriage, Fleetwood held a number of senior political and administrative posts under the
Commonwealth
, including
Lord Deputy of Ireland
from 1652 to 1655.
After Cromwell's death in September 1658, Fleetwood initially supported his son
Richard Cromwell
as
Lord Protector
, before forcing him from power in April 1659. Together with
John Lambert
, he dominated government for a little over a year before being outmaneuvered by
George Monck
.
Following the
Stuart Restoration
, Fleetwood was excluded from the
Act of Indemnity of 1660
, but escaped prosecution since he had not been involved in the
Execution of Charles I
in January 1649. Instead, he was barred from public office, and lived quietly in
Stoke Newington
, where he died on 4 October 1692.
Early life
[
edit
]
Charles Fleetwood was the third son of Sir
Miles Fleetwood
of
Aldwinkle
,
Northamptonshire
, and of Anne, daughter of Nicholas Luke of
Woodend, Bedfordshire
. He may have been educated at
Emmanuel College, Cambridge
,
[1]
before being admitted into
Gray's Inn
on 30 November 1638.
[2]
English Civil War
[
edit
]
At the beginning of the
First English Civil War
in August 1642, like many other young lawyers who afterwards distinguished themselves in the field, he joined
Essex
’s life-guard, was wounded at the
first battle of Newbury
(1643), obtained a regiment in 1644 and fought at
Naseby
. He had already been appointed receiver of the court of wards, and in 1646 became
member of parliament
for
Marlborough
. In the dispute between the army and parliament he played a chief part, and was said to have been the principal author of the plot to seize King
Charles
at
Holmby
, but he did not participate in the king’s trial. In 1649 he was appointed a governor of the
Isle of Wight
, and in 1650, as lieutenant-general of the horse, took part in
Cromwell
’s campaign in
Scotland
and assisted in the victory of
Dunbar
. The next year he was elected a member of the
Council of State
, and being recalled from Scotland was entrusted with the command of the forces in England, and played a principal part in gaining the final triumph at
Worcester
(3 September 1651).
[3]
Ireland
[
edit
]
Fleetwood's second wife
Bridget Cromwell
, widow of
Henry Ireton
and daughter of
Oliver Cromwell
In 1652 he married Cromwell’s daughter, Bridget, widow of
Henry Ireton
, and became commander-in-chief of the Parliamentarian forces in
Ireland
, to which title that of
Lord Deputy of Ireland
was added. The first year of his tenure saw the mopping up of the last Catholic Irish guerrilla resistance to the
Cromwellian conquest of Ireland
.
[3]
Fleetwood negotiated with the remaining guerrilla bands to either surrender or to leave the country for service in the army of a country not at war with the Commonwealth of England. The last organised Irish force surrendered in 1653.
The chief feature of his civilian administration, which lasted from September 1652 till September 1655, was the implementation of the
Act of Settlement 1652
, which decreed the settlement of the
New Model Army
's soldiers on the confiscated estates of Catholic landowners and the transplantation of the original owners. Fleetwood carried out these policies ruthlessly. (For details of this period see
The Cromwellian Plantation
). He showed also great severity in the prosecution of the
Roman Catholic
priests, and favoured the
Anabaptists
and the extreme
Puritan
sects to the disadvantage of the moderate
Presbyterians
, exciting great and general discontent, a petition being finally sent in for his recall.
[3]
Career under the Protectorate
[
edit
]
Fleetwood was a strong and unswerving follower of Cromwell's policy. He supported Cromwell's assumption of the position of
Lord Protector
and his dismissal of the parliaments. In December 1654 he became a member of the council, and after his return to England in 1655 was appointed one of the
administrative major-generals
. He approved of the
Humble Petition and Advice
, only objecting to the conferring of the title of "king" on Cromwell; became a member of the
new House of Lords
; and supported ardently Cromwell's foreign policy in Europe, based on religious divisions, and his defence of the
Protestants
persecuted abroad. He was therefore, on Cromwell's death, naturally regarded as a likely successor, and it is said that Cromwell had in fact so nominated him. He, however, gave his support to
Richard Cromwell
's assumption of office, but allowed subsequently, if he did not instigate, petitions from the army demanding its independence, and finally (with the aid of the other officers in the
Wallingford House party
) compelled Richard by force to dissolve the
Third Protectorate Parliament
.
[3]
His project of re-establishing Richard in close dependence upon the army met with failure, and he was obliged to recall the
Rump Parliament
on 6 May 1659. He was appointed immediately a member of the
Committee of Safety
and of the
Council of State
, and one of the seven commissioners for the army, while on 9 June 1659 he was nominated
commander-in-chief
. In reality, however, his power was undermined and was attacked by parliament, which in October declared his commission void. The next day he assisted
John Lambert
in his expulsion of the Rump Parliament and was reappointed commander-in-chief.
[3]
Collapse of the Protectorate and Restoration of the Monarchy
[
edit
]
With the suppression of parliament, the Committee of Safety led by Fleetwood and Lambert was nominally left as absolute ruler of the Commonwealth. The regime was practically without public support however. Presbyterians opposed the Committee for its perceived devotion to the
Independents
cause, republicans had been alienated by the dissolution of parliament and pay for the rank and file of the army was long in arrears.
Several Parliamentarian Generals led by
George Monck
had decided that the only way to stabilise the country was to restore the monarchy. Monck accordingly led his troops, which had been garrisoned in Scotland, to march on London. On
George Monck
's approach from the North, Fleetwood stayed in
London
and maintained order. While hesitating with which party to ally his forces, and while on the point of making terms with King
Charles II
, Monck's army restored the
Rump Parliament
on 24 December, whereupon Fleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before parliament to answer for his conduct.
[3]
The reversal of Pride's Purge with the re-admittance of the members of
Long Parliament
to the Rump, the
Convention Parliament
and the start of the
Restoration
therefore all took place without his influence. He was included in the
Act of Indemnity
as among the twenty liable to penalties other than capital, and was finally incapacitated from holding any office of trust. His public career then closed, though he survived till 4 October 1692.
[3]
He was buried in
Bunhill Fields
.
[2]
Legacy
[
edit
]
Fleetwood acquired by his marriage in 1664 to Mary, daughter of Sir
John Coke
and widow of Sir
Edward Hartopp
,
[2]
an estate in
Stoke Newington
, then a village north of London;
Fleetwood House
, next to Abney House on
Church Street
was named after him.
[4]
It served as a meeting place for
Dissenters
, and from 1824 housed the
Newington Academy for Girls
, an innovative
Quaker
school.
[5]
Cornelius Varley
, a water-colour painter, named his son
Cromwell Fleetwood "C.F." Varley
(1828-1883), in the belief that the family was descended from both Fleetwood and Cromwell. The Varley family business was near Stoke Newington.

Italian nobleman
Sante I Bentivoglio
(1426-June 24, 1462) was an Italian nobleman who ruled as
tyrant
or de facto prince of
Bologna
from 1445 to 1462.
Sante Bentivoglio
Officially the son of a poor blacksmith, he worked as a youth in the wool industry in Florence under another name, until he was alleged to be a natural son of
Ercole Bentivoglio
. He was educated at
Florence
in the court of
Cosimo de' Medici the Elder
[1]
and possessed a vast culture. Through his putative noble father, Sante can pretend to be a cousin of
Annibale I Bentivoglio
, at the time ruler of Bologna (also of dubious paternity). When Annibale was killed in an ambuscade by a rival family, the people of Bologna gave him the government of their city with the title of
Gonfaloniere di Giustizia
. He was also named as sole tutor of Annibale's son,
Giovanni
. The event transformed Sante from a Florentine popolano into the virtual prince of Bologna. It was with Sante Bentivoglio's seizure of power, encouraged by the Duke of Milan, that the
Signoria
was ultimately established in Bologna.
In 1454 he married
Ginevra Sforza
, then fourteen years old, the daughter of
Alessandro Sforza
, lord of
Pesaro
, establishing his family's close relationship with the
Sforza
dynasty.
[2]
The two had two daughters: Costanza (1458-1491), who married Antonmaria
Pico della Mirandola
, and Ercola (1459-1505). He also had a son Ercole (1459-1507), who became a condottiero and fought for Florence in several successive wars.
[3]
In 1457 the Pope and Sante Bentivoglio created a mixed constitutional state in Bologna. In 1460 Sante started building the impressive
Palazzo Bentivoglio
, which was destroyed in 1507 after the Bentivoglio were ousted from Bologna. He obtained from the pope's autonomy of government over the city and established a communal senate including local nobles and Papal representants. He worked in cooperation with the representatives of the pope:
Pius II
even visited Bologna two times in 1458 and 1459. It did not trust them however and said on one occasion: "The blood of my own kin has taught me a bitter lesson as to the little faith that can be placed in priests."
[4]
Politically, he allied with the
Republic of Venice
, the
House of Sforza
and the
house of Medici
, playing on the Venetian fear of both Milan and Florence. He died in Bologna in 1462 due to illness, being succeeded by Giovanni II Bentivoglio, Annibale's son, who later remarried his widow Ginevra.
The great Bolognese historian
Cherubino Ghirardacci
wrote that 'Sante Bentivoglio had achieved the highest reputation, not just among the citizens of Bologna, but also among the lords of Italy, which was a marvellous thing'

is a survival
top-down view
video game
for
PC
/
Microsoft Windows
, developed by
independent
Finnish
programmer
Ville Mönkkönen. Released as
freeware
in 2003, later also the
source code
was released under a
custom license
. It won second place in the "Adventure Game of the Year" contest
[1]
on GameTunnel. In 2015 a "Notrium Special Surprise Edition" was released commercially by the author in the
digital distribution
.
[2]
Setting
[
edit
]
Location
[
edit
]
The game takes place on the fictional eponymous planet, Notrium. The game world is divided into large squares, each of which has its own separate environment and set of objectives. The player may move between squares at will to reach the other areas, though some are only accessible via methods such as boarding certain vehicles or using
teleportation
. Environments range from
jungle
terrain, to desert, to
tundra
, all of which are affected by a day-night cycle,
[3]
except for interior levels which are artificially lit.
The game's graphics, aside from certain plot-related areas, are all randomly generated at the beginning of the game.
[4]
Random generation affects the precise location of items and vegetation, though most objects and all scenery will remain in their environment square, the placement of which in relation to others is a set constant. For example, tree placement in the Jungle zone changes each time a new game is begun, but the start location will not, and the Jungle zone stays adjacent to the same areas.
Backstory
[
edit
]
The general plot of the game is that a
starship
, the
Var' Equinalin
, is exploring the Hive sector, when it approaches the titular
planet
Notrium, and is attacked by ground-launched missiles. The player's character (either the human captain, the
android
engineer, the
psionic
medic, or the alien stowaway) manages to reach the only working
escape pod
(the others having been sabotaged by the alien) and crash-lands on the planet's surface. From there, they must find a way to survive, as well as a method of escape.
[5]
Varying on whichever character is being played, 'journal entries', which appear every day-night cycle for the first in-game
fortnight
, detail different happenings. For example, the journal of the Human tells that he was the captain of the ship, and details his experience on board the spacecraft; while the journal of the Android states that he was the ship's
mechanic
and goes into his point of view over the same proceedings. Other plot points outside of journal entries are triggered by entering certain locales, or completing an objective.
[6]
Notrium
has several endings, which differ depending on what character the player has chosen to use. Some endings are exclusive to certain characters, while others can be achieved by more than one.
[7]
Gameplay
[
edit
]
Notrium
is played from a top-down perspective, giving an overhead view of proceedings. The player may move in all directions while facing in a separate one, similar to the way a
first-person shooter
is controlled, and similar to the
shareware
PC shooter
Crimsonland
.
During the course of the game, the player encounters various items and objects strewn across the terrain, such as edible plants, weapons, and other machinery. As most needed materials, such as a protective
force field
, are not found intact, the player is required to build them out of two or three separate pieces. Most useful machinery in the game is constructed in this manner.
Gameplay revolves around harvesting needed materials to build, defend oneself against enemies, and ultimately achieving one of the game's endings. Depending on the character chosen, the game is played differently. Most characters begin with a weak attack, and no weaponry, yielding them quite vulnerable to the various enemies. The Alien begins with a powerful attack and evolves more abilities over time, though it cannot use weapons, so an Alien player tends to be more aggressive, taking advantage of the more difficult endings which would take longer for other characters to achieve. In contrast, the Human is weaker, and a Human player will take time to build up a heavy arsenal of weaponry and armor before attempting action.
[5]
In-game weather also plays a large part in the game. On difficulty settings above 'easy', the player's character is affected by the elements, especially heat and cold. Standing near a fire or in the shade of a tree will counteract these two, and later in the game the player is able to construct an armor which decreases the effects of weather. In some areas of the game, weather is more extreme; the location undergoing
sand storms
,
blizzards
, or acid rain.
[8]
Mods
[
edit
]
Notrium
is designed to be highly
moddable
,
[5]
and a
is provided for
download
on Ville's
website
. When the player begins a new game, they are able to choose the mod they want to play, provided that additional mods have been downloaded and placed in the correct place in the main
Notrium
folder on the player's PC
desktop
.
Mods can have a variety of different effects, such as adding new items and objectives, altering or creating new environments, or even adding a completely new character for play in the case of the popular "Werivar" mod.
[5]
History
[
edit
]
Notrium
was developed by
independent
Finnish
programmer
Ville Mönkkönen and released in 2003.
[9]
It is the seventh game by Mönkkönen, but only the fifth to be released fully in
English
. Notrium's
source code
was released by the developer after 2003 under a custom
open-source
like
software license
. It is developed as OpenNotrium on
GitHub
by the community, with new code being
GPLv3
.
[10]
Following that, the game was
ported
to many other platforms (
Linux
etc.), also mobile devices like the
Pandora
.
[11]
On Dec 8, 2015 a "Notrium Special Surprise Edition" was released commercially by the author in the
digital distribution
adding some improvements.
[12]
Reception
[
edit
]
The game won second place in the "Adventure Game of the Year" contest
[1]
on GameTunnel. In a 2014 retrospective,
Rock, Paper, Shotgun
noted Notrium as one of the early procedural generated survival games.

In 1544, during the
Crisis of the Sixteenth Century
(1521-1597) in the
Jaffna Kingdom
,
Cankili I
killed 600 Catholic converts. Portuguese missionaries attributed the baptism, martyrdom and intercession of the
Mannar
Martyrs
for the rapid conversion and growth of Catholicism in
Sri Lanka
. In a letter found in the Archives of the
Society of Jesus
(S.J.) dated 19 December 1561,
Anrique Anriquez
the first Mannar parish priest (1561-1564) gives details to how rapidly the island was converted, and churches and hospital built all around the island. The Christians of the island of Mannar were held up as a model. He wrote since their arrival, over a thousand people converted to Christianity.
[1]
: 43-48
A Sri Lankan trilingual film named
Praana ('Praana' in Sinhala, 'Seeds' in English and 'Viththukkal' in Tamil)
, was made in 2022, based on this incident.
The zeal of the inhabitants of Mannar to become Christians
[
edit
]
In their book on the life of
St. Francis Xavier
,
Daniello Bartoli
and
Giovanni Maffei
stated “that of the many various States which sent to ask Xavier to come and impart the light of Gospel none is so deserving of remembrance, none deserving of praise as we say of a holy envy as the Mannarese who prove themselves the beautiful models and masters of patience and heroic fortitude to the whole of that new Eastern Church. With them the reception of Baptism and shedding of their blood, the birth unto Christ and their death for Christ went hand in hand. So rapidly did the fruit ripen of which God has blessed the seed, that they who yesterday were idolaters and today Christians and would be tomorrow be Martyrs”.
[2]
: 78-79
Jesuit historian Fernão de Queiróz expressed similar admiration towards the deputation. “The chief men of Mannar moved by Divine Spirit send deputation to St Francis Xavier to signify to him the disposition that were therein and the importance of his visiting and account which he would have to give to God if he failed to visit.” They had heard of the devotion and the earnestness and personal holiness of St. Francis and of the conversion of those in India. The deputation from Mannar came from the homogenous community in Careapatao. Since the saint was engaged in baptising and pastoral care of new converts he was unable to go at that time. St Francis Xavier chose a native cleric, Francis Xavier and told him “I entrust to you the enterprise of Mannar. Wherein I trust in the Lord you will reap such great fruits. Go my son, and may God help you”. Cleric Francis set out at once with the envoys, who though they regretted not to take the saint with them were greatly relieved to learn from him they would have him later on in that island. Cleric Francis Xavier reached Mannar where he was well received and in a short time catechised a vast number of inhabitants of Mannar. He baptised up to six hundred person with usual ceremonies, thoroughly well grounded in the Faith as their constancy showed.

The Martyrdom
[
edit
]
The temple priests learned the reports of a new religion and marched to Nallur to represent to the King
Cankili I
the outrage of a Minister of another religion going about his territories perverting the people and setting against him. They told the king new converts razing temples and idols and an unknown God was worshiped in their place. They told him unless he took prompt action, he would soon find himself without a kingdom, idols and temples. The king issued an edict “renounce Christianity or die”. The new converts many who were in the service of this King in Mannar could have foreseen the consequence they would face by becoming Christians because they were aware the tyrant king who seized the throne in 1519 hate of Portuguese and Christianity. The king immediately mustered five thousand men from the coast of mainland and Jaffnapatnam and set out for Mannar. He met with no other resistance than that of tears which some shed out of consolation and joy at seeing the constancy with which others died. The smallest children crying out when their mothers tried to hide them from seeing their companions beheaded, they offered their throat to the executioners with the wonderful power of faith. The king known for his other tyrannies was their Captain and spared neither sex nor age.
[3]
: 242
Daniello Bartoli
&
Giovanni Maffei
provide a similar account about the martyrdom. The edict was executed with as much cruelty as it was given, without distinction of age, sex or rank. Men, women, youth and infancy, in a word whoever received baptism were ruthlessly slaughtered. The king swore not to leave one of them alive. Admirable indeed were the effects of Grace of Baptism. As each one in turn was asked whether he or she were Christian, whereas a negative answer would at once have placed their lives in a safety so generous were these neophytes that far from having recourse to subterfuge, they boldly confessed the Faith. Fathers and mothers answering for their little ones to whom age has yet denied the power of speech. Between six and seven hundred were slain on this occasion. The place of their Martyrdom called Pasim(Patim) deserve a more noble name and accordingly from this date it has been called the Land of Martyrs.

Relics and place of martyrdom of Mannar Catholic Martyrs, 1544
The adjoining place of martyrdom of Catholic Martyrs Pattim
Queiroz mentioned Cleric Francis Xavier and Uraccinga (llam Singai) a sort of Governor- tributary prince were martyred. There is also an old tradition recorded by Dr. Bonjean in the Missions Catholiques of Lyons that the king and his executioners were on hot pursuit for a convert named Santa Cruz as he had been going about among the Christians comforting and encouraging them to lay down their lives joyfully for God. Executioners severed his head with one stroke of the sword.
[4]
: 45
Martyrdom likely occurred between October 1544 and December 1544, most likely in November or early December. The Portuguese called
Mannar Island
Illa dos Martyres
.
Henrique Henriques in his letter dated December 19, 1561 wrote “half a league from the Fortress is place which they called Patim”. He stated in it were the Christians of the same island who were already Christians before they came to this Island. He further wrote “ It is true that at the time we came to inhabit it they were out of the said island on account of the injuries (cruelties) done by the king of that country with whom we were at war and are so now”. He stated there were two villages where Christians lived and a little more than a league from Patim there is a larger village of Christians Some of the converts who had escaped by boats to Mantota in mainland returned to their village at Patim when Jesuits of the Fishery Coast came to Mannar with their flocks in 1560. Carea patao according to Georg Schurhammer, refers to the little village of Patim. Christians of the smaller village were the first converts of Cleric Francis Xavier.
In 1945 Fr. Antoninus,
O.M.I.
using ancient maps of Mannar from Survey Department find the site known to local residents as Paddi Theravai (open plain of Patti) about half a mile west of the 2nd mile post on Mannar- Talaimannar Rord to be the location of Patim. Excavation carried out by Fr. Antoninus in that location found ruins of a Church, a broken down altar, and several skeletons lying in all directions , some belonging to children , others with heads got separated. Also a skeleton lying with head slightly turned and part of the bones on the edges showed reddish colour. New converts would have congregated for prayers and were massacred and place of worship destroyed to wipe out Christianity. Fr. Antoninus also found a coin and Dr. Paranavitana then archeologist identified it as a Roman coin with words "
Claudius Imperator
" that suggest the possibility of Christian community in Mannar during Roman time when Mantota was the centre of International trade route.

Relics of Cathloic Martyrs Mannar Island
In 2018, while excavating for building construction near Mannar Fort over 300 human skeletal remains including children were found. Hundreds of people also died due to pestilence few years after the killing of new converts.  Investigations are being carried out to find the cause of death. According to Carbon dating done by Beta Analytic, the samples belong to a period 1400 AD to 1650 AD.
[5]
Cause for Canonization
[
edit
]
The Vatican
Congregation for the Causes of Saints
had given the go-ahead for the diocesan inquiry for the canonisation. Prior to the establishment of Congregation in 1588 , martyrs were recognised for their heroic virtue were declared saints by local churches. St Francis Xavier, under the
Padroado
agreement was the ambassador of the Pope Paul III and King John III missionary to the East Indies. Since St Francis Xavier and missionaries considered Mannar Martyrs as Blessed and sought Martyrs intercession before God, Mannar martyrs thus seemed to meet the criteria of that time to be considered as martyrs of Catholic church.
St. Francis Xavier in his letter dated January 27, 1545 to Jesuit fathers in Rome wrote “Thanks be given to God our Lord because we do not lack martyrs in our time. And that while he sees so few souls themselves of all his divine mercy and indulgence to work out their salvation. He permits in the mystery of his providence that human barbarity should fill up the destined ranks and number of the Blessed.”
[1]
: 21
Miguel Vaz, the Vicar General of Goa when he reached Portugal in October 1545, gave detail account of the Martyrdom to king John III as he heard from St. Francis Xavier. King immediately wrote to Jesuit Superior asking for more missionaries to be sent to India. Fr. Le Fevre, the Visiting General of the Jesuits exclaimed “I do not know to give expression to all that my soul has felt in Jesus Christ on learning about the glorious death of the six hundreds Martyrs of India. How happy we would be if we could possess in Europe the relics of their bodies and of their blood- we who are the elders in Faith."
[1]
: 17-18
Dominique Bouhours
in his book, the life of St.Francis Xavier mentioned about St Francis Xavier visit to Mannar and praying to God offering the merits of the Martyrs to end pestilence in Mannar. When Saint Francis Xavier visited Mannar after the martyrdom, he reverently kissed the ground which had been moistened with the blood of martyrs of Pasim (Patim). While he rejoiced at the happiness of the dead, he had the reason to be afflicted at the misery of the living as a contagious disease laid waste the island and daily carried off a hundred persons. When Manarese were told that the great father so celebrated throughout India was at Pasim, three thousand of them most of whom were pagans assembled and most earnestly besought him to deliver them from the pestilence. Xavier demanded three days that he might ask of God the favour which they sought. During this time his prayer principally consisted in offering up to God the merits of the blessed Martyrs who had suffered for his name at Pasim. Before the termination of the three days, his prayers were heard. The plague ceased and all the sick were simultaneously restored to health. So visible an interposition of God's power caused them to believe in Jesus Christ and demand baptism which they received from the Apostle.

The
history of Poland
from 1945 to 1989
spans the period of
Marxist-Leninist regime
in
Poland
after the end of
World War II
. These years, while featuring general
industrialization
,
urbanization
and many improvements in the
standard of living
,
[a1]
were marred by early
Stalinist
repressions, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.
Near the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet
Red Army
, along with the
Polish Armed Forces in the East
, pushed out the
Nazi German
forces from
occupied Poland
. In February 1945, the
Yalta Conference
sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections.
Joseph Stalin
, the leader of the
Soviet Union
, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled
Provisional Government of National Unity
was formed in
Warsaw
by ignoring the
Polish government-in-exile
based in
London
since 1940.
During the subsequent
Potsdam Conference
in July-August 1945, the three major
Allies
ratified a massive westerly shift of Poland's borders and approved its new territory between the
Oder-Neisse line
and the
Curzon Line
. The area of Poland was reduced in comparison to its pre-World War II extent and geographically resembled that of the
medieval
early
Piast dynasty
era. Following the destruction of the
Polish-Jewish
population in
the Holocaust
, the
flight and expulsion of Germans
in the west,
resettlement of Ukrainians
in the east, and the
expulsion and resettlement of Poles
from the
Eastern Borderlands
(
Kresy
), Poland became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government
solidified its political power
, while the
Polish United Workers' Party
(PZPR) under
Bolesław Bierut
gained firm control over the country, which would remain an independent state within the
Soviet sphere of influence
. The
July Constitution
was promulgated on 22 July 1952 and the country officially became the
Polish People's Republic
(PRL).
Following Stalin's death in 1953, a political "
thaw
" allowed a more liberal faction of the
Polish communists
, led by
Władysław Gomułka
, to
gain power
. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the
1968 Polish political crisis
and the
1970 Polish protests
when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale loans from western creditors, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the
world economy
and it faltered after the
1973 oil crisis
. In 1976, the government of
Edward Gierek
was forced to raise prices again which led to the
June 1976 protests
.
This cycle of repression and reform
[b]
and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojtyła as
Pope John Paul II
. Wojtyła's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the
authoritarian
and ineffective system of
nomenklatura
-run
state socialism
, especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent
trade union
"
Solidarity
" (
Solidarność
) led by
Lech Wałęsa
. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of
Wojciech Jaruzelski
to declare
martial law
in December 1981. However, with the reforms of
Mikhail Gorbachev
in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989
Round Table Talks
led to Solidarity's participation in the
1989 election
. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the
succession of transitions
from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency following the
presidential election
and was succeeded by Wałęsa.
Establishment of communist-ruled Poland (1944-1948)
Border and population shifts
Poland's
old and new borders, 1945
[

]
Before
World War II
, a third of Poland's population was composed of
ethnic minorities
. Poland had about 35 million inhabitants in 1939, but fewer than 24 million in 1946, within the respective borders. Of the remaining population over three million were ethnic minorities, such as Germans, Ukrainians and Jews, most of whom would soon leave Poland.
[1]
Poland suffered the heaviest
proportionate human losses
during World War II, amounting to 16-17 percent of its population.
[2]
It is estimated that up to 6 million Polish citizens died from war-related causes between 1939 and 1945.
[3]
The approximate figure includes 3 million
Jewish-Polish
victims as part of the above total. The number of ethnically Polish victims was perhaps 2 million.
[4]
[5]
[6]
The historical minorities in Poland were
most significantly affected
, whereas Poland's multiethnic
diversity
reflected in prior national censuses was
all but gone
within several years after the war.
[7]
[8]
The Polish educated class suffered greatly. A large proportion of the country's pre-war social and political elite perished or were dispersed.
[9]
[10]

The implementation of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle of the new government to acquire centralized authority,
[11]
further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945.
[12]
The Soviet forces present at that time engaged in plunder of the
former eastern territories of Germany
which were being transferred to Poland, stripping them of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and sending them to the Soviet Union.
[13]
[14]
After the Soviet annexation of the
Kresy
territories east of the
Curzon Line
, about 2 million Poles were
moved, transferred or expelled
from these areas into the new western and northern territories east of the
Oder-Neisse line
,
[15]
[16]
which were transferred from Germany to Poland under the
Potsdam Agreement
.
[17]
Others stayed in what had become the Soviet Union and more went to Poland after 1956.
[16]
Additional settlement with people from central parts of Poland brought the number of Poles in what the government called the
Recovered Territories
up to 5 million by 1950. Most of the
former German population of 10 million
had
fled or was expelled
to
post-war Germany
by 1950:
[8]
[18]
about 4.4 million fled in the final stages of the war and 3.5 million were removed by the Polish authorities in 1945-1949.
[19]
The expulsion of the Germans was the result of the Allied decisions finalized in Potsdam.
[16]
[b1]
With the
expulsion of Ukrainians
and Belarusians
from Poland to the Soviet Union and the 1947
Operation Vistula
dispersing the remaining
Ukrainians in Poland
,
[20]
and with most of the
Polish Jews
exterminated by
Nazi Germany
during
the Holocaust
and many of the survivors emigrating to the West and to newly created
Israel
,
[16]
Poland for the first time
became an ethnically homogeneous nation state
.
[8]
The government-imposed and spontaneous movements of people amounted to one of the greatest demographic upheavals in European history.
[16]
Unlike other European countries, Poland continued the extensive prosecution of both Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators into the 1950s. According to
Alexander Prusin
, Poland was the most consistent in investigating and prosecuting war crimes among the post-war communist nations; between 1944 and 1985 Polish courts tried over 20,000 defendants including 5,450 German nationals.
[21]
Rebuilding of infrastructure and economy
Destroyed Warsaw
, January 1945
Poland suffered catastrophic damage to its
infrastructure
during the war, which caused it to lag even further behind
the West
in its industrial output.
[22]
The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to over 30% of the pre-war potential.
[22]
Poland's capital of
Warsaw
was among the most devastated cities - over 80 percent destroyed in the aftermath of the
Warsaw Uprising
of 1944. The Polish state acquired more highly developed western territories and lost the more economically backward eastern regions. Already in 1948 the prewar level of industrial production was exceeded in global and per capita terms during the
Three-Year Plan
(
Plan Trzyletni
), implemented first and fueled by the collective desire to rebuild shattered lives.
[11]
The Three-Year Plan was the work of the Central Planning Office led by
Czesław Bobrowski
and PPR economist
Hilary Minc
, who declared the need to preserve elements of
market
capitalism
. Standard of living of the population of Poland markedly improved.
[23]
Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored
Marshall Plan
in 1947 and to join the Soviet Union-dominated
Comecon
in 1949.
[24]
[25]
Warsaw and other ruined cities were cleared of rubble — mainly by hand — and rebuilt with great speed (one of the successes of the Three-Year Plan)
[26]
at the expense of former German cities like
Wrocław
, which often provided the needed construction material.
[27]
Wrocław,
Gdańsk
,
Szczecin
and other formerly German cities were also completely rebuilt.

Historian
Norman Davies
wrote that the new Polish frontiers, from the Polish interests point of view, entirely advantageous, but realized at the cost of enormous suffering and specious justifications. The radically new Eastern European borders constituted a "colossal feat of political engineering", but could not be derived from immemorial historical determinations, as claimed by the communist propaganda.
[28]
Consolidation of communist power
Already before the Red Army entered Poland, the Soviet Union was pursuing a strategy of eliminating pro-Western resistance as an organized force to ensure that Poland would fall under its sphere of influence.
[29]
In 1943, following the revelation of the
Katyn massacre
, Stalin suspended relations with the
Polish government-in-exile
in London.
[30]
At the February 1945
Yalta Conference
, the Soviet Union agreed to allow the formation of a coalition government composed of the communists, including the
Polish Workers' Party
(
Polska Partia Robotnicza
, PPR), as well as Polish pro-Western elements in exile and in Poland, and subsequently to arrange for free
elections
to be held.
[31]
The
PKWN Manifesto
, officially issued on 22 July 1944. In reality it was not finished until mid-August, after the Polish communist
Moscow group
was joined by the late-arriving
Warsaw group
, led by
Gomułka
and
Bierut
.
[32]
After the prewar
Communist Party of Poland
was eliminated in
Stalin's purges
in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought to
Russia
and killed), a group of survivors led by
Marceli Nowotko
,
Bolesław Mołojec
and
Paweł Finder
convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow of the need to reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there,
Władysław Gomułka
emerged as the PPR's first secretary by the end of 1943. Gomułka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish
leftist
movement. He loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and
Ukraine
in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938-39. Throughout the
German occupation
, Gomułka remained in Poland and was not a part of the circle organized in the Soviet Union around the
Union of Polish Patriots
by Stalin and
Wanda Wasilewska
. In Polish society of 1945, Gomułka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.
[33]
With the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the
Home Army
's
Operation Tempest
in 1944, control over what was to become post-war Poland passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to
Polish communists
, who formed the
Polish Committee of National Liberation
(
Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego
, PKWN), an early government, in existence from late July 1944 in
Lublin
. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland,
[34]
despite having initially minuscule popular support.
[35]
The PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the
March Constitution of Poland
, as opposed to the
April Constitution
.
[25]
[36]
On 6 September 1944, the PKWN issued its momentous
land reform
decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from parcellation of the
larger estates
.
[37]
The communists, favored by the Yalta decisions, enjoyed the advantages of Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe firmly under the influence of the Soviet Union; they exercised control over crucial government departments, such as the security services (security was in the hands of the Soviet
NKVD
until its Polish counterparts were developed).
[32]
[31]
Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the
populist
program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's
delegation
was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its
political-military organizations
became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the
PKWN Manifesto
and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support.
[38]
Beyond the land reform, the PKWN Manifesto foresaw no further radical ownership changes and
nationalization
of industry was not mentioned. On the contrary, business property was supposed to return to its owners as the economic relations become properly regulated.
[39]
From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established
workers' councils
, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.
[40]
The PKWN was reshaped into the
Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland
(
Rząd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej
, RTRP), which functioned from January 1945.
[34]
This government was headed by
Edward Osóbka-Morawski
, a
socialist
, but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees such as
Michał Rola-Żymierski
, held a majority of key posts.
[33]
In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or
émigré
impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland.
[25]
[41]
The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the
State National Council
(
Krajowa Rada Narodowa
, KRN), formed by Gomułka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the
Council of National Unity
(
Rada Jedności Narodowej
, RJN).

The Yalta agreement stipulated a governmental union in Poland of "all democratic and anti-Nazi elements". Prime Minister
Stanisław Mikołajczyk
of the Polish government-in-exile resigned his post in November 1944 and having accepted the Yalta terms went to Moscow, where he negotiated with
Bolesław Bierut
the shape of a "national unity" government". Mikołajczyk, along with several other exiled Polish leaders, returned to Poland in July 1945.
[42]
[43]
The new Polish
Provisional Government of National Unity
(
Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej
, TRJN) — as the Polish government was called until the
elections of 1947
— was established on 28 June 1945.
[34]
Osóbka-Morawski was kept as prime minister, Gomułka became first deputy prime minister and Mikołajczyk second deputy and minister of agriculture. The government was "provisional" and the
Potsdam Conference
soon declared that before a regular government is created, free elections must be held and a permanent constitutional system established.
[42]
The communists' principal rivals were
veteran activists
of the
Polish Underground State
, Mikołajczyk's
Polish People's Party
(
Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe
, PSL), and veterans of the
Polish Armed Forces in the West
. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party (originally a peasant formation), because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections.
[44]
Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, would be allowed to act as a bridge between the East and the West.
[43]
Soviet-oriented parties, backed by the Soviet Red Army and in control of the security forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Gomułka and Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated at the time of the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.
[26]
[33]
[45]
As a show of Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the
Polish anti-Nazi underground
were brought to
trial in Moscow
in June 1945.
[46]
Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility of a democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements.
[47]
The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief.
[42]
The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by
Tomasz Arciszewski
, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.
[48]
In the years 1945-47, about 500,000 Soviet soldiers were stationed in Poland. Between 1945 and 1948, some 150,000 Poles were imprisoned by the Soviet authorities. Many former Home Army members were apprehended and executed.
[49]
During the PPR
Central Committee
Plenum of May 1945, Gomułka complained that the Polish masses regard the Polish communists as the "NKVD's worst agency" and
Edward Ochab
declared the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Poland a high priority.
[41]
But in the meantime tens of thousands of Poles died in the postwar struggle and persecution and tens of thousands were sentenced by courts on fabricated and arbitrary charges or deported to the Soviet Union.
[47]
The status of Soviet troops in Poland was not legalized until late 1956, when the Polish-Soviet declaration "On the legal status of Soviet forces temporarily stationed in Poland" was signed.
[50]
The Soviet
Northern Group of Forces
would be permanently stationed in Poland.

, 9 June 1946, Warsaw
Stalin had promised at the Yalta Conference that free elections would be held in Poland. However, the Polish communists, led by Gomułka and Bierut, while having no intention of giving up power, were also aware of the limited support they enjoyed among the general population. To circumvent this difficulty, in 1946 a national plebiscite, known as the
"Three Times Yes" referendum
(
Trzy razy tak
), was held first, before the parliamentary elections.
[51]
The referendum comprised three fairly general, but politically charged questions about the Senate, national industries and western borders. It was meant to check and promote the popularity of communist initiatives in Poland. Since most of the important parties at the time were leftist or centrist - and could have easily approved all three options - Mikołajczyk's Polish People's Party (PSL) decided, not to be seen as merging into the government bloc, to ask its supporters to oppose the first one: the abolition of the Senate.
[52]
The communists voted "Three Times Yes". The partial results, reconstructed by the PSL, showed that the communist side was met with little support on the first question. However, after a campaign marked by electoral fraud and intimidation the communists claimed large majorities on all three questions,
[53]
[52]
which led to the
nationalization
of industry and state control of economic activity in general, and a unicameral national parliament (
Sejm
).
[26]
[31]
[54]
[55]
The communists consolidated power by gradually whittling away the rights of their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party - Mikołajczyk's PSL.
[44]
In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were sentenced to death on trumped up charges — among them
Witold Pilecki
, the organizer of the
Auschwitz
resistance. Leaders of the Home Army and of the Council of National Unity were persecuted. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially or forced to exile.
[56]
The opposition members were also harassed by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and
right-wing organizations
by state security kept
some partisans
in the forests, the actions of the
Ministry of Public Security
(known as the UB, Department of Security), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The
right-wing insurgency
radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945
[57]
and faded after the
amnesty of February 1947
.
[58]
[59]
By 1946, all rightist parties had been outlawed,
[31]
and a new pro-government
Democratic Bloc
was formed in 1947 which included only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the
first parliamentary elections
took place featuring primarily the PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party. However, the PSL's strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution.
[31]
Election results were adjusted by Stalin to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords.
[60]
The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics.
[25]
[26]
[31]
[54]
[55]
After the referendum dress rehearsal, this time the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, an NKVD colonel charged with election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new
Sejm
, out of 444 seats, 27 were given to the
Polish People's Party
of
Stanisław Mikołajczyk
.
[61]
He, having declared the results to be falsified, was threatened with arrest or worse and fled the country in October 1947, helped by the
US
Embassy; other opposition leaders also left.
[55]
[61]
In February, the new
Sejm
created the
Small Constitution of 1947
. Over the next two years, the communists monopolized political power in Poland.
[31]
Polish United Workers' Party and its rule
Logo of the
Polish United Workers' Party
Additional force in Polish politics, the long-established
Polish Socialist Party
(
Polska Partia Socjalistyczna
, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the
salami tactics
to dismember the opposition.
[62]
Communist politicians cooperated with the left-wing PPS faction led by
Józef Cyrankiewicz
, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The
socialists
' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise.
[44]
Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea of a party merger. The
Kremlin
, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972).
[63]
In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief,
[64]
the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the
Polish United Workers' Party
(
Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza
, PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a
de facto
one-party state
and a
satellite state
of the Soviet Union.
[26]
Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: the
United People's Party
(ZSL) that had split from Mikołajczyk's
PSL
and was meant to represent rural communities, and the
Alliance of Democrats
(SD), a token
intelligentsia
party (see also:
List of political parties in Poland
).
[31]
As the period of
Sovietization
and
Stalinism
began, the PZPR was anything but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with the PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction.
[64]
The PZPR became divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While
Marxism-Leninism
, the official ideology, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, including those of the
Sanation
, the
National Democracy
, and 19th century traditions of cooperation with the
partitioning powers
.
[33]
With Poland being a member of the
Soviet Bloc
, the party's pursuits of power and reform were permanently hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction).
[65]
Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.
[48]
The
nomenklatura
political elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling party structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds.
Nomenklatura
members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management, or education. For the party, the privileged
nomenklatura
layer was maintained to assure the proper placement of people who were ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the
revisionist
dissidents
Jacek Kuroń
and
Karol Modzelewski
later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political
bureaucracy
for its own sake.
[40]
The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted
nomenklatura
and the security services were resented.

Removal of Gomułka, Stalinist repressions
As in other
Eastern Bloc
countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of "nationalist" or other "
deviationist
" tendencies.
[67]
The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of
Marian Spychalski
from May 1950, and
Michał Rola-Żymierski
five months after Stalin's death.
[68]
In September 1948 Władysław Gomułka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like Gomułka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from
Leninism
, and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary.
[67]
[69]
Gomułka, accused of "right-wing nationalist deviations", had indeed emphasized the
Polish socialist
traditions and severely criticized
Rosa Luxemburg
's
Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania
(SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations.
[70]
More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomułka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy.
[71]
Following Bolesław Bierut's order, he was arrested by the
Ministry of Public Security
(MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by
Roman Romkowski
and
Anatol Fejgin
, as demanded by the Soviets.
[72]
Gomułka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut,
Jakub Berman
, and other Stalin's associates.
[73]
[74]
Under interrogation he defiantly conducted his defense, threatened to reveal "the whole truth" if put on a trial and remained unbroken. Gomułka was thus placed in prison without a typical
show trial
(he was released in December 1954).
[72]
[75]
Bierut replaced Gomułka as the PPR (and then the PZPR) leader.
[31]
Gomułka remained protected by his Polish comrades to the best of their ability and the record of his sometime defiance came in handy when in 1956 there was an opportunity for the Polish party to reassert itself.
[64]
The Stalinist government was controlled by Polish communists originating from wartime factions and organizations operating in the Soviet Union under Stalin, such as the
Union of Polish Patriots
. Their leaders at that time included
Wanda Wasilewska
and
Zygmunt Berling
.
[38]
[69]
Now in Poland, those who remained politically active and in favor ruled the country, aided by the MBP and Soviet "advisers", who were placed in every arm of the government and state security as a guarantee of pro-Soviet policy of the state. The most important of them was
Konstantin Rokossovsky
(
Konstanty Rokossowski
in Polish), defense minister of Poland from 1949 to 1956,
Marshal of the Soviet Union
and war hero.
[76]
[77]
Military conscription was introduced following a postwar hiatus and the army soon reached its permanent size of 400,000 men.
[78]
The
Palace of Culture and Science
in Warsaw, initially called the Stalin's Palace, was a controversial gift from Soviet leader
Joseph Stalin
The Soviet-style secret police including the Department of Security (UB) grew to around 32,000 agents as of 1953. At its Stalinist peak, there was one UB agent for every 800 Polish citizens.
[79]
The MBP was also in charge of the Internal Security Corps, the Civil Militia (
MO
), border guard, prison staff and paramilitary police
ORMO
used for special actions (with over 100,000 members). The ORMO originated from popular self-defense efforts, which were a spontaneous reaction to the explosion of crime in the power vacuum of 1944-45. In February 1946, the PPR channeled and formalized this citizen militia movement, creating its ostensibly crime control voluntary ORMO structure.
[80]
Primarily in Stalin's lifetime, public prosecutors and judges as well as functionaries of the Ministry of Public Security and the
Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army
engaged in acts recognized by international law as crimes against humanity and crimes against peace.
[74]
One example was the
1951 Mokotów Prison execution
in Warsaw of members of the
Freedom and Independence
(WiN) organization, former participants in anti-Nazi resistance, after the official amnesty and their voluntary disclosure.
[81]
The postwar Polish Army, intelligence and police were staffed with Soviet NKVD officers who stationed in Poland with the
Northern Group of Forces
until 1956.
[82]
Mass arrests continued during the early 1950s. In October 1950, 5,000 people were arrested in one night in the so-called "Operation K". In 1952, over 21,000 people were arrested. By the second half of 1952, according to official data, 49,500 political prisoners were being held.
[83]
Former Home Army commander
Emil August Fieldorf
was subjected to several years of brutal persecution in the Soviet Union and Poland before being executed in February 1953, just before Stalin's death.
[84]
Resistance to the Soviet and native Stalinists was widespread among not only the general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited the oppressive system's damage in Poland to well below that of other European communist-ruled countries. According to
Norman Davies
, political violence after 1947 was not widespread.
[85]
The Church, subjected to partial property confiscations,
[25]
remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained its potential to affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale collectivization and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the
Polish October
of 1956.
[85]
Nationalization and centrally planned economy
Avenue of the Roses,
Nowa Huta
In February 1948, Minister of Industry
Hilary Minc
, a Marxist economist, attacked the Central Planning Office of Poland as a "
bourgeois
" remnant, the office was abolished and the Polish Stalinist economy was born. The government, headed by President Bierut, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and Minc, embarked on a sweeping program of economic reform and national reconstruction.
[86]
Poland was brought into line with the Soviet model of a "
people's republic
" and
centrally planned
command economy
,
[31]
in place of the façade of democracy and partial
market economy
which the regime had maintained until 1948.
[26]
The relationships of ownership of the industry, the banking sector and rural property after the nationalization and the land reform were fundamentally altered. The changes, implemented in the name of
egalitarianism
, enjoyed broad societal approval and support.
[66]
The structure of Polish economy was established in the late 1940s and the early 1950s.
[40]
Soviet-style planning
begun in 1950 with the
Six-Year Plan
.
[31]
The plan focused on rapid development of
heavy industry
("accelerated industrialization", after the outbreak of the
Korean War
driven by Soviet military demands at the expense of many cancelled consumer-oriented investments)
[23]
[40]
and the (eventually futile)
collectivization of agriculture
. Among the main projects was the
Lenin Steelworks
and its supporting "socialist city" of
Nowa Huta
(New Steel Mill), both built from the scratch in the early 1950s near
Kraków
, of which Nowa Huta soon became a part.
[87]
The
land seized from prewar large landowners
was redistributed to the poorer peasants, but subsequent attempts at taking the land from farmers for collectivization met wide resentment. In what became known as the
battle for trade
, the private trade and industry were
nationalized
. Within few years most private shops disappeared.
[31]
The regime embarked on the
campaign of collectivization
(
State Agricultural Farms
were created),
[26]
although the paceA of this change was slower than in other Soviet satellites.
[31]
Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual peasants would continue to dominate agriculture. A Soviet-Polish trade treaty, initiated in January 1948, dictated the dominant direction of Poland's future foreign trade and economic cooperation.
[88]
In 1948, the United States announced the
Marshall Plan
initiative to help rebuild postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow.
[25]
Also, following the
Uprising of 1953 in East Germany
, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union to give up its claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens.
[89]
Poland received compensation in the form of land and property left behind by the German population of the
annexed western territories
.

Despite the lack of American aid, the East European "command economies", including Poland, made some progress in bridging the historically existing
wealth gap
with the market economy driven Western Europe.
[90]
Because of the
capital accumulation
, the Polish
national income
grew in real terms by over 76% and the agricultural and industrial production more than doubled between 1947 and 1950. The economic transition and industrialization were accompanied and made possible by massive social transformations, as peasants migrated and were converted into city dwelling
working class
(1.8 million between 1946 and 1955) and the country went through a period of rapid
urbanization
(total population of the cities increased by 3.1 million).
[91]
[c1]
The influx of cheap labor and the availability of the Soviet market facilitated an accumulation of resources, despite low productivity and insufficient investment in new technologies.
[40]
The centrally planned socialist economies of Eastern Europe in terms of growth during the postwar years did relatively better than the West, only to sustain economic damage later, especially after the
1973 oil crisis
.
[90]
However, the rise in living standards caused by the earlier industrial dynamics was not comparable to that in the West.

The
Constitution of the Polish People's Republic
was promulgated in July 1952 and the state officially became the
Polish People's Republic
(PRL).
[92]
Among the rights it guaranteed was universal free health care. The large
state-owned enterprises
provided to employees an extensive range of welfare and leisure activities, including housing, sports facilities and hospitals, which started to diminish in the 1970s.
[93]
In the early 1950s, the Stalinist regime also carried out
major changes to the education system
. The program of free and compulsory school education for all and the establishment of free institutions of higher learning received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by
ideological censorship
.
[31]
During 1951-53, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived by the regime as reactionary was dismissed from universities. Government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style
socialist realism
became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature represented
propaganda of the party
or had to be in line with its views. (See also:
Socialist realism in Poland

The reforms often brought relief for a significant part of the population. After World War II many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, latent popular discontent remained present and many Poles adopted the attitude of "resigned cooperation". Others, like the
Freedom and Independence
organization that originated from elements of the Home Army and especially the
National Armed Forces
actively opposed the communists, hoping for a
World War III
that would liberate Poland. Most
people who took up arms against the communist regime
had surrendered during the amnesties of 1945 and
1947
, but brutal repressions by the secret police continued and some fought well into the 1950s.

The PAX did not get very far in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press. In 1953

The constitution of 1952 guaranteed on paper all sorts of democratic rights and freedoms.

Stalin died in 1953, which was followed by a partial thaw in Poland.
[97]
Nikita Khrushchev
became
first secretary
of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
. The PZPR's Second Congress deliberated in March 1954. Cyrankiewicz, previously replaced as prime minister by Bierut, was returned to that post (to remain prime minister until December 1970). The Six-Year Plan was adjusted to increase production of items for popular consumption. Khrushchev, present at the Congress, asked Bierut for the reasons of the continuing detention of Gomułka, "a good communist"; Bierut denied having specific knowledge of Gomułka's imprisonment.
[98]
Following the defection to the West and revelations of its official
Józef Światło
, the
Ministry of Public Security
was abolished in December 1954. Gomułka and his associates were freed from confinement and censorship was slightly relaxed.
[90]
The two notable periodicals braving the prohibitions were
Po prostu
('Simply') and
Nowa Kultura
('The New Culture') (
Po prostu
was closed down and its defenders brutally pacified in October 1957, just one year after Gomułka's rise to power).
[99]
[100]
From early 1955, the Polish press engaged in criticizing the Stalinist recent past and praising the older
Polish socialist traditions
(
social democratic
Marxism
and national independence). Political discussion clubs were on the rise throughout the country. The party itself appeared to be moving in the social democratic direction. Leftist intellectuals, who had joined the party because of their commitment to
social justice
, were heading in the social democratic direction more decisively and they soon gave rise to the Polish
revisionism
movement.
[70]
In February 1956, Khrushchev denounced
Stalin's cult of personality
at the
20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
and embarked on a
reform course
.
[99]
The
de-Stalinization
of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a difficult position.
[55]
While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers were beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (he was attending the Soviet party's congress)
[101]
exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party.
[55]
In March Bierut was succeeded by
Edward Ochab
as first secretary.
[90]
As the 20th Congress inspired also partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.
[40]
The number of security agents was cut by 22%. By a widespread amnesty, 35,000 detainees across the entire country were released. 9,000 imprisoned for political reasons were freed in all. Hardline Stalinists, such as
Jakub Berman
,
Roman Romkowski
and
Anatol Fejgin
were removed from power, some arrested.
[102]
Berman, dismissed in May, by Gomułka's decision was never prosecuted.
[101]
[103]
A few perpetrators of Stalinist crimes were prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms. A much broader plan to charge the responsible and verify all of the security apparatus was formally presented by the prosecutors, but the action was not approved by Gomułka, who counted among the Stalinist persecution victims, as did his wife. Gomułka conducted some purges and reforms but did not want to destabilize the security system, now under his control, by wide-ranging formal prosecutions.
[104]
Gomułka's road to socialism (1956-1970)
Polish October
Władysław Gomułka
Beginning on 28 June 1956, workers in the industrial city of
Poznań
, who had repeatedly but in vain petitioned the authorities to intervene and improve their deteriorating situation,
[105]
went on strike and rioted
in response to a cut in wages and changed working conditions.
[90]
Demonstrations by
factory workers
turned into a huge citywide protest.
[105]
16 tanks, 2 armoured personnel carriers and 30 vehicles were brought to bear by a local military commander. Some of them were seized by the protesters, who also broke into the local government buildings.
[105]
57 people were killed and several hundred injured in two days of fighting.
[106]
Several major military formations entered the scene, but the army's role was mainly that of support of the
police
and
security forces
action.
[101]
[105]
[a]
At the Poznań radio station, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz warned and threatened the rioters in his widely publicized speech: he "...who will dare raise his hand against the people's rule may be sure that... the authorities will chop off his hand".
[90]
[105]
Of the 746 people officially detained during and in the aftermath of the disturbances, almost 80% were workers. The authorities launched an investigation, attempting to uncover a claimed premeditated instigation and involvement by Western or anticommunist underground centers. Such efforts were unsuccessful and the events were found to have been spontaneous and locally supported.
[105]
The Poznań revolt's lasting impact was that it caused a deeper and more
liberal
realignment within the Polish communist party and in its relationship to Moscow.
[90]
Deeply shaken by the protests and violence,
[90]
the 7th Plenum of the Central Committee, held in July 1956, split into two groups, the "hardliners"
Natolin
and the "reformist"
Puławy
factions, named after the locations where they held their meetings.
[107]
[108]
The
Natolin
faction consisted largely of communist officials from the army and state security, including
Franciszek Jóźwiak
,
Mieczysław Moczar
,
Zenon Kliszko
and
Zenon Nowak
, who advocated the removal of "Stalin's Jewish protégés", but were themselves of Stalinist sympathies.
[109]
Many in the
Puławy
faction were former Stalinist fanatics and past enemies of Gomułka's. Now become liberal reformers and supporters of Gomułka's return to power.
[69]
[110]
In response to the recent disturbances, the regime turned to conciliation: wage rises and other reforms for the Poznań workers were announced. In the party and among the intellectuals, demands for wider reforms of the Stalinist system were becoming more widespread and intense.
[107]
Realizing the need for new leadership, in what became known as the
Polish October
, the
Politburo
chose Gomułka, who had been released from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR.
[25]
[90]
Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland.
[31]
[55]
Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was reinforced by pressure from communist
China
, which demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone.
[111]
On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland.
[109]
Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous
social democratic
-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing
revisionists
and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable.
[70]
The revisionists aspired to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. Their main goals were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises.
[112]
However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the
Warsaw Pact
was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of
NATO
.
[78]
Many Soviet officers serving in the
Polish Armed Forces
were dismissed,
[55]
[77]
but very few Stalinist officials were put on trial for the repressions of the Bierut period. The
Puławy
faction argued that mass trials of Stalinist officials, many of them Jewish, would incite animosity toward the Jews.
Konstantin Rokossovsky
and other Soviet advisers were sent home, and the Polish communist establishment and system took on a more independent orientation.
[26]
[31]
Gomułka, conscious of geopolitical realities, agreed that
Soviet troops would remain in Poland
and no overt anti-Soviet outbursts would be allowed. However, he formalized the Polish-Soviet relations and the unprecedented for a Soviet-allied state military cooperation treaty, signed in December 1956, stated that the stationing of the Soviet forces in Poland "can in no way violate the sovereignty of the Polish state and cannot lead to their interference in internal matters of the Polish People's Republic".
[113]
Poland thus avoided the risk of Soviet armed intervention of the kind that crushed the
Hungarian Revolution of 1956
. On his part, Gomułka rewarded the Soviets for his internal leeway with loyal support for the duration of his career. In one act of defiance, the Polish delegation at the
United Nations
abstained in November 1956 from the vote condemning the Soviet intervention in Hungary.
[114]
There were repeated attempts by some
Polish academics and philosophers
, many related to the prewar
Lwów-Warsaw school
- such as
Leszek Kołakowski
,
Stanisław Ossowski
and
Adam Schaff
- to create a bridge between Poland's history and
Marxist
ideology and develop a specific form of
Polish Marxism
. Such efforts were stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk the wrath of the Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet
party line
. Kołakowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomułka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and had to emigrate in 1968.
[104]
[115]
[116]
Among other noted revisionists were
Włodzimierz Brus
,
Bronisław Baczko
,
Zygmunt Bauman
, and
Krzysztof Pomian
. The PZPR establishment saw them as true supporters of capitalist social democracy, pretending to be socialists.
[117]
Scaling back of campaign promises
The Fourth Congress of the
Polish United Workers' Party
, held in 1963
Poland welcomed Gomułka's rise to power with relief.
[55]
Gomułka promised an end to police terror, greater intellectual and religious freedom, higher wages, and the reversal of collectivization; and to some degree he fulfilled these promises.
[25]
[26]
[31]
Production of consumer goods was somewhat increased. The party elite as well as academic and literary
intelligentsia
experienced greater freedom and significant gains, felt as "a certain diversity and revitalization of elite public life".
[70]
The dissident discussion group
Club of the Crooked Circle
[
pl
]
survived until 1962.
[118]
Other forms of collective community expression and a legally guaranteed academic autonomy (based on the 1958 statute of higher learning)
[119]
lasted until the
1968 Polish political crisis
.
[70]
[120]
The permitted academic discourse was in marked contrast to the treatment afforded workers, whose self-management councils that had spontaneously formed in 1956 were neutralized and brought under control of the party by 1958.
[40]
[70]
In the communist era, because of their
class
role in the official ideology and leadership's sensibilities, workers enjoyed some clout and a degree of protection of their economic interests, on the condition that they refrained from engaging in independent politics or publicly exerting pressure.
[112]
Economic reform was attempted when the
Sejm
created the Economic Council in 1957. The council included the prominent economists
Oskar R. Lange
,
Czesław Bobrowski
,
Michał Kalecki
, and
Edward Lipiński
. They proposed a
market
reform, beginning with the granting of greater self-rule and more independent decision-making capability to enterprises, to facilitate their "realization of plan goals". But the recommended economic improvements, despite the self-restraint of the authors, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.
[121]
In October 1957, Poland's Foreign Minister
Adam Rapacki
proposed a European
nuclear-free zone
that would include the territories of Poland,
West Germany
,
East Germany
and
Czechoslovakia
.
[114]
In August 1961, the new
Berlin Wall
cemented the division of Europe.
During 1948-71, the Polish government signed
indemnification
agreements with a number of
West European
countries (excluding those considered allies of
Nazi Germany
),
Canada
and the
United States
. The agreements dealt with compensation for the losses incurred by citizens and firms of the countries involved as a result of war events and the subsequent
nationalization
. The agreement with the U.S. followed the visit to Poland of
Vice President
Richard Nixon
in August 1959 and his talks with Gomułka. It was signed in 1960 and the agreed amount had been paid by the Polish government in twenty installments. The U.S. government thereby assumed responsibility for indemnities resulting from claims filed by U.S. citizens.
[122]
After the first wave of reform, Gomułka's regime started to move back on their promises. Control over mass media and universities was gradually tightened, and many of the younger and more reformist members of the party were forced out (over 200,000 purged already in 1958, when the PZPR undertook a "verification" of its membership).
[117]
The reform-promising Gomułka of 1956 turned into the authoritarian Gomułka of the 1960s. Although Poland enjoyed a period of relative stability in that decade, the idealism of the "Polish October" faded away.
[25]
[26]
[31]
The decisions made at the XIII Plenum of the Central Committee, held in 1963, meant a definite end of the post-October liberalization period. The demise of Gomułka's tactical allies, the
Puławy
faction, gradually replaced by Gomułka's own people, was apparent when
Roman Zambrowski
, the leading Jewish politician, was removed from the Politburo.
[123]
Poland under Gomułka's rule was generally considered one of the more liberal
communist states
. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing
political satire
about the party leader, as
Janusz Szpotański
did,
[124]
or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 "Letter of the 34", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the constitution.
[125]
Jacek Kuroń
and
Karol Modzelewski
were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (an "Open Letter to the Party") of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state.
[126]
Kuroń and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from
leftist positions
and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.
[127]
As the regime was getting less liberal and more repressive, Gomułka's popularity declined as his initial vision lost its impetus.
[31]
Many Poles found Gomułka's self-righteous attitude irritating and his demeanor provincial. He reacted to increasing criticism by refusing to budge and insulating himself with the help of cronies, of whom
Zenon Kliszko
was the most influential. Within the party, Minister of the Interior
Mieczysław Moczar
and his nationalist-communist faction known as "the Partisans" (together with
Moczarowcy
, the much broader system of Moczar's political clientele) were looking for an opportunity to assert their dominance.
[69]
[123]
[128]
The
Polski Fiat 125p
, produced in Poland from the late 1960s, was based on technology purchased from
Fiat
By the mid-1960s, Poland was starting to experience economic difficulties and the appreciable thus far standard of living improvements were showing signs of stagnation (during 1960-70 real wages for workers grew only by an average of 1.8% per year). The postwar
economic boom
was ending and the increasingly
globalized
and integrated
world economy
was becoming inhospitable to national developments operating behind trade barriers.
[40]
[129]
Like the other communist states, Poland was spending too much on heavy industry, armaments and prestige projects and too little on consumer production. The failure of Soviet-style collectivization returned the collectivized land to the peasants,
[31]
but most of their farms were too small to be prosperous and productivity in agriculture remained low. Economic relations with West Germany were frozen due to East German interference and resistance to economic integration. Gomułka attributed the signs of economic decline to faulty implementation of the fundamentally correct directions issued by central organs of the party. He failed to appreciate the corrective role of the
market
, whose
feedback
could not be replaced by theoretical computations, planning and administrative decisions.
[130]
On the other hand, pursuing conservative investment rather than consumption oriented economic policies, his government generated no foreign debt.
[131]
From 1960, the regime increasingly implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult.
[132]
Gomułka, according to
Andrzej Leder
, was the last Polish politician who seriously tried to realize an
anti-clerical
program, a staple leftist undertaking.
[133]
In 1965, the
Conference of Polish Bishops
issued the
Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops
.
[134]
In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the
Christianization of Poland
led by the
primate
, Cardinal
Stefan Wyszyński
and other bishops who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the
Catholic Church in Poland
.
[135]
In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing the origin of Polish statehood,
[135]
but the display of the Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic
prelates
in the
Vatican
and elsewhere. The state-church dialogue, symbolized by the presence of the few
Znak
independent Catholic deputies in parliament, was rapidly deteriorating.
[25]
1968 events
Standard-bearers of the 27 Tank Regiment, mid-1960s
By the 1960s, rival regime officials and their followers, generally from the younger generation of party activists, had begun to plot against the rule of Gomułka and his associates. Poland's security chief Mieczysław Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger.
[25]
The party leader in
Upper Silesia
,
Edward Gierek
, who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France,
[136]
also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the
nomenklatura
.
[137]
From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the
Prague Spring
.
[138]
In March 1968, student demonstrations at the
University of Warsaw
broke out in the wake of the government's ban on further performance of the play
Dziady
by
Adam Mickiewicz
(written in 1824) at the
National Theatre in Warsaw
,
[139]
because of its alleged "anti-Soviet references". Subsequently, the
ORMO
and other security formations attacked protesting university students in several major cities.
[140]
[u]
In what became known as the
March 1968 events
, Moczar used the prior spontaneous and informal celebrations of the outcome of the Arab-Israeli
Six-Day War
of 1967 and now the Warsaw theatre affair as pretexts to launch an anti-intellectual and anti-Semitic (officially designated as "
anti-Zionist
") press campaign, whose real goal was to weaken the pro-reform liberal party faction and attack other circles.
[25]
[26]
[140]
Thousands of generally secular and integrated people of Jewish origin lost their employment and some 15,000 Jews emigrated between 1967 and 1971.
[141]
Of what used to be the prewar Europe's largest Jewish community, only several thousand people remained in Poland.
[142]
Dziady
, a theatrical event that spawned
nationwide protests
Other victims were college students, many of whom were expelled from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students and the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved.
[k]
Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred.
[143]
The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power early in his term.
[144]
The revisionist dissident prominence in the 1968 events overshadowed the equally significant awakening taking place among the working class of Poland.
Gdańsk
, where thousands of students and workers fought the police on March 15, had the highest in the country rate of administrative detentions and court cases.
[145]
The greatest proportion of people arrested and imprisoned in March and April 1968 in Poland were classified by the authorities as "workers".
[146]
An internal attempt was made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and tolerated. In the meantime, irreversible damage to society had been wrecked by the Moczar movement. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by
Leonid Brezhnev
, was preoccupied with the
crisis in Czechoslovakia
and not inclined to support personnel changes in the Polish leadership.
[140]
In August 1968, the
Polish People's Army
took part in the
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
.
[25]
[55]
Some Polish intellectuals protested, and
Ryszard Siwiec
burned himself alive during celebrations of an official holiday. The Polish participation in the crushing of the
Czech liberalization movement
(the crowning achievement of
Marxist revisionism
, according to David Ost) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters.
[55]
[143]
But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR reconfirmed his rule in November. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his
Brezhnev Doctrine
, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the "fraternal course".
[140]
Treaty with West Germany, food riots and the ousting of Gomułka
Demonstrators in
Gdynia
carry the body of
Zbigniew Godlewski
, who was shot and killed during the
protests of 1970
In December 1970, Gomułka's government scored a major political success when Poland obtained recognition by
West Germany
of
post-World War II borders
.
[26]
[55]
In the negotiations leading to the
Treaty of Warsaw
, the German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for residents of Poland of German identity and the ability to help financially those who stayed in Poland by granting pensions. Hundreds of thousands eventually became affected.
[147]
German Chancellor
Willy Brandt
, who signed the agreement, used the occasion to ask on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (
Kniefall von Warschau
). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was made at the site of the
Warsaw Ghetto
and thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church leaders issued the
Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops
, criticized then by the Polish government.
[26]
Gomułka felt proud and secure after the treaty with West Germany, his milestone political achievement. It signified a lasting trend in Poland's international policy: extricating the country from the disproportional dependence on Russia and compensating the security vulnerability by building good relations with Germany.
[147]
[148]
But the event could not mask the economic crisis into which Poland was drifting. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 the regime unexpectedly announced substantial increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs.
[31]
The new measures were incomprehensible to many workers, and their unfortunate timing (before Christmas, the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.
[

On 14-19 December 1970,
mass demonstrations
against the price rises broke out in the northern (
Baltic
coast) cities of
Gdańsk
,
Gdynia
,
Elbląg
and
Szczecin
.
[25]
[31]
[55]
In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including headquarters of the party in Gdańsk and Szczecin.
[147]
The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomułka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property.
[149]
Gomułka, however, was determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict.
[150]
Among the party leaders who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gdańsk, were
Zenon Kliszko
and
Stanisław Kociołek
. In Gdynia, soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. Possibly about fifty people were killed in the coastal region in December.
[149]
[151]
The protest movement spread to other cities, leading to more strikes and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for 21 December 1970.
[150]
The party leadership meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized the danger that the working class revolt presented to their system. In consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, they proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomułka, who was by then stressed out and ill.
[150]
Several of his collaborators were also removed.
Edward Gierek
was drafted as the new first secretary.
Mieczysław Moczar
, another strong contender, was not trusted and even blamed for the current debacle by the Soviets.
[149]
Another strike in Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. Gierek gambled that his personal appearances would resolve the crisis. He went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day, met the workers, apologized for the past mistakes and assured them that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Participants of the Szczecin strike demanded freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek consented, but in reality the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing labor structures and their places of employment. The February
1971 Łódź strikes
followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes promised.
[152]
[153]
[154]
The Polish opposition movement, traditionally led by the intelligentsia, after the two heavy blows of 1968 and 1970 was in disarray and silent. The revisionists' tenuous connection with the communist party was permanently broken, but a new strategy had not yet emerged.
[143]
However, already in 1971
Leszek Kołakowski
published in the émigré
Kultura
journal a seminal article entitled
Theses on Hope and Hopelessness
. It put forward a concept of civil democratizing resistance movement that would be valid even in the repressed and seemingly deadlocked
state socialist
society.
[155]
Gierek decade (1970-1980)
Catching up with the West
Edward Gierek
Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came to power on a raft of promises that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and those responsible for the violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He proceeded to create a new economic program, based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West, to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek years, was intended to be used for equipment and modernization of Polish industry, and for import of
consumer goods
to give the workers more incentive to work.
[31]
[154]
For the next few years, the regime optimistically engaged in reform and experimentation and for the first time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other luxury items. Attention was paid to the wages workers received. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. Censorship was eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were improved. The relative cultural and political relaxation resulted in a better
freedom of speech
environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly
Polityka
. The massive investments and purchases of Western technology were expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture.
[153]
The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.
[156]
This "New Development Strategy", based on import-led growth,
[156]
depended on the global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices.
[55]
[157]
The effects of the
1973-74 oil crisis
produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, which resulted in a sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly
coal
. Poland's
foreign debt
, absent at the time of Gomułka's departure,
[158]
rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from Polish shops. The new factories built by Gierek's regime proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market
demand
and
cost effectiveness
were often ignored.
[26]
[55]
The significant internal economic reform, promised by the Gierek team, had not materialized.
[159]
The Western credits thus helped spur industrial growth and helped Gierek's policy of
consumerism
, but just for a few years. The industrial production grew by an average of 10% per year between 1971 and 1975 (the years remembered later by many older Poles as most prosperous, considering not only the communist period in Poland), only to dwindle to less than 2% in 1979.
Debt servicing
that took 12% of export earnings in 1971, rose to 75% in 1979.
[156]
[160]
In 1975, like other European countries, Poland became a signatory of the
Helsinki Accords
and member of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE); such developments were possible because of the period of "
détente
" between the Soviet Union and the United States. Despite the regime's promises that the freedoms listed in the agreement would be implemented in Poland, there was little change. However, the Poles were becoming more aware of the rights they were being denied and emboldened by the knowledge of their government's treaty obligations.
[31]
Gierek government's growing difficulties led also to increased dependence on the Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The
constitution
, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after
protests by intellectuals
and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.
[31]
[153]
[161]
Nevertheless, the regime of Gierek deemphasized the Marxist ideology and from his time the "communist" governments of Poland concentrated on pragmatic issues and current concerns.
[162]
In Polish economic politics new lasting trends were initiated, such as the emphasis on individual initiative, personal aspirations and competition, which some interpreted as an attack on
egalitarianism
(social inequalities were indeed increasing). Sections of the
intelligentsia
,
nomenklatura
and
small business
gave rise to the emerging
middle class
. The new "socialist" ways were less totalitarian, stressed innovation, modern management methods and engaged workers, all seen as necessary to push the outdated economy past the constant crisis stage. Poland of the 1970s became more open to the world and entered the
global economy
, which permanently changed society, creating at the same time a new type of crisis vulnerability. The opposition thinking, its promotion of society formed by active individuals, developed along complementary concepts.
[163]
[164]
Renewal of social unrest and the rise of organized opposition
Queue line
, a frequent scene at times of
shortages
of
consumer goods
in the 1970s and 1980s
As a result of the 1970 worker rebellion food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already in the first two years of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s.
[165]
In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption,
[156]
the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomułka'a increases from six years before. The compensatory wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population.
[153]
[w]
The result was an immediate
nationwide wave of strikes
, with violent demonstrations, looting and other labor unrest at the
Ursus Factory
near Warsaw, in
Radom
,
Płock
and other places.
[166]
The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial.
[156]
A series of "spontaneous" large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the "anger of the people" at the "trouble-makers" was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with
Leonid Brezhnev
were now seriously damaged. Food
ration cards
, introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic.
[167]
The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power) nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments. The government was in a quandary, the population suffered from the lack of necessities, and organized opposition found room to expand and consolidate.
[153]
Because of the 1976 disturbances and the subsequent arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by
Jacek Kuroń
,
Antoni Macierewicz
,
Jan Józef Lipski
and
Adam Michnik
founded and operated the
Workers' Defence Committee
(
Komitet Obrony Robotników
; KOR).
[168]
The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression.
[25]
[157]
Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role of the working class in resisting the abuses of the regime. Accordingly, the newly formed opposition was increasingly characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers.
[112]
[169]
The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered
political pluralism
.
[170]
More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the
Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights
(ROPCiO),
Free Trade Unions of the Coast
(WZZW) and the
Confederation of Independent Poland
(KPN).
[25]
The periodical
Robotnik
('The Worker') was distributed in factories from September 1977.
[170]
The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970-71. Now it was developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of
Solidarity
. The KPN represented the minority
right-wing
of the Polish opposition scene at that time.
[143]
[171]
The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the
Constitution of the Polish People's Republic
, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. They fit within the post-
Helsinki
Soviet Bloc human rights movements and for the most part had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.
[153]
[x]
For the rest of the 1970s, resistance to the regime grew, assuming also the forms of student groups,
clandestine newspapers and publishers
, importing books and newspapers, and even a "
Flying University
".
[31]
The regime practiced various forms of repression against the budding reform movements.
[172]
Polish Pope John Paul II
Millions cheer
Pope John Paul II
in his first visit to Poland as pontiff in 1979
On 16 October 1978, Poland experienced what many Poles literally believed to be a miracle. Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, the
archbishop of Kraków
, was elected
pope
at the Vatican, taking the name
John Paul II
. The election of a Polish pope had an electrifying effect on what was at that time one of the last idiosyncratically Catholic countries in Europe.
[25]
When John Paul toured Poland in June 1979, half a million people came to welcome him in Warsaw; in the next eight days, about ten million Poles attended the many outdoor
masses
he celebrated.
[173]
John Paul clearly became the most important person in Poland, leaving the regime not so much opposed as ignored. Rather than calling for rebellion, John Paul encouraged the creation of an "alternative Poland" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front.
[174]
[175]
Polish emigration
The
Polish government-in-exile
in
London
, unrecognized since the end of World War II, ridiculed by the communists
[
]
, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance. Under President
Edward Bernard Raczyński
it overcame years of internal squabbles, and after the election of the Polish pope, at the time of the increasingly assertive Polish opposition, improved its image and standing.
[176]
The large Polish emigrant communities in North America, Western Europe and elsewhere were politically active and lent significant support to those struggling in the country. The staunchly anti-communist American
Polonia
and other Poles felt grateful for the leadership of President
Ronald Reagan
. Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the
Radio Free Europe
, whose Polish section was run by
Jan Nowak-Jeziorański
, and the monthly literary
Kultura
magazine in
Paris
, led by
Jerzy Giedroyc
and
Juliusz Mieroszewski
.
[176]
Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980-1989)
Failing economy and labor unrest
By 1980, the authorities had no choice but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic level, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western
financial companies and institutions
providing loans to the regime at a meeting at the
Bank Handlowy
in Warsaw on 24 April 1980
[177]
The bankers made it clear that the state could no longer subsidize artificially low prices of consumer goods. The government gave in after two months and, on 1 July, announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and
factory occupations
began at once, with the biggest ones
taking place in Lublin
in July.
[157]
[178]
[179]
Lech Wałęsa
speaks during the strike at the
Gdańsk Shipyard
, August 1980
The strikes reached the politically sensitive
Baltic Sea
coast, with a sit-down strike at the
Lenin Shipyard
in
Gdańsk
beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of the strike were
Anna Walentynowicz
and
Lech Wałęsa
, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of
21 demands
was formulated by the
Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee
on 17 August.
[180]
The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With the assistance of activists from the
KOR
and support of many other intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations),
[181]
the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of
trade unions
independent of government control.
[157]
[178]
Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.
[179]
The party leadership was faced with a choice between repressions on a massive scale and an amicable agreement that would give the workers what they wanted and thus quieten the aroused population.
[182]
[183]
They chose the latter. On 31 August Wałęsa signed the
Gdańsk Agreement
with
Mieczysław Jagielski
, a member of the party
Politburo
.
[157]
The agreement acknowledged the right of employees to associate in free trade unions, obliged the government to take steps to eliminate censorship, abolished weekend work, increased the
minimum wage
, improved and extended welfare and pensions and increased autonomy of industrial enterprises, where a meaningful role was to be played by
workers' self-management
councils. The rule of the party was significantly weakened (to a "leading role in the state", not society) but nonetheless explicitly recognized, together with Poland's international alliances.
[182]
[183]
It was seen by the more moderate forces, including leading intelligentsia advisers and the Catholic hierarchy, as necessary to prevent a Soviet intervention.
[157]
The opposition negotiators did not concern themselves with the issue of affordability of the economic concessions they obtained and a wave of national euphoria swept the country. In addition to the Gdańsk Agreement, similar documents were signed at other centers of strike activity: in Szczecin (the
Szczecin Agreement
),
Jastrzębie-Zdrój
, and at
Katowice Steelworks
.
[184]
Solidarity
25th anniversary of
Solidarity
, summer 2005 in
Gdańsk
The Gdańsk Agreement, an aftermath of the August 1980 strike, was an important milestone. It led to a national gathering of independent union representatives (Interfactory Organizing Committees, MKZ) on 17 September in Gdańsk and the formation of the trade union "
Solidarity
" (Polish
Solidarność
), founded on that day and led by Lech Wałęsa.
[25]
[179]
[184]
[185]
[j]
The ideas of the independent union movement spread rapidly throughout Poland; Solidarity structures were formed in most places of employment and in all regions.
[186]
Having been able to overcome the regime's efforts to thwart or derail its activities and status, Solidarity was finally registered in court as a national labor union in November.
[187]
Early in 1981, a network of union organizations at the enterprise-level was established; it included the country's main industrial complexes, such as the
Lenin Steelworks
in Kraków and the
Silesian
mines.
[179]
Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political movement aiming at reconstruction of
civil society
.
[127]
Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments.
[188]
In 1981, Solidarity accepted the necessity of assuming a political role and helped form a broad anti-
ruling system
social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from
people associated with the Catholic Church
to non-communist leftists.
[179]
[189]
The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of
nonviolent resistance
.
[190]
According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980-81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers.
[166]
In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.
[112]
[p]
The activity of Solidarity, although concerned with trade union matters (such as replacing the
nomenklatura
-run system with worker self-management in enterprise-level decision making),
[h]
was widely regarded as the first step towards dismantling the regime's dominance over social institutions, professional organizations and community associations.
[191]
Because of conditions specific to
state socialist
society, Solidarity soon lost its labor focus and became a
universalist
movement that emphasized
civic rights
and
open society
.
[112]
Removing the ruling formation or breaking the dependence on the Soviet Union was not on the agenda.
[192]
Using strikes and other tactics, the union sought to block government policies.
[157]
The aims of the original, so-called First Solidarity (1980-81), were to reform socialism, not to introduce industrial private ownership or promote
capitalism
in general.
[186]
[193]
Solidarity was an egalitarian and collectivist movement. It did not postulate any re-privatization of property taken over by the state after World War II or of rural possessions generated by the
land reform
, as such concepts were beyond the
axiological
horizon of Polish society.
[66]
[194]
Solidarity was socialist and
social justice
was its goal.
[186]
[195]
The First Solidarity upheaval could be viewed also as working people revolting against the emerging capitalist features of the economic order that diminished their role in Gierek-led society, combined with the "anti-politics" approach (building civil society "without reference to both state and market") embraced at that time by their allied intellectual leaders.
[164]
[196]
People of decidedly anticommunist or anti-PZPR orientations constituted a relatively small minority within the First Solidarity organization, which accommodated one million communist party members among its ranks.
[197]
Apart from workers, both individual farmers and students created their own independent organizations:
Rural Solidarity
and
Independent Students' Union
. They were formally recognized by the authorities only after strike actions conducted by activists of both movements in January 1981.
[198]
In September 1980, in the aftermath of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by
Stanisław Kania
.
[25]
Like his predecessors, Kania made promises that the regime could not fulfill because the authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. The
gross national income
fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8%, and in 1981 by 15-20%.
[157]
At the communist summit in December 1980 in
Moscow
, Kania argued with
Leonid Brezhnev
and other
Warsaw Pact
leaders, who pressed for an immediate military intervention in Poland. Kania and Minister of Defense
Wojciech Jaruzelski
declared their determination to fight the "counterrevolution" in Poland on their own. In regard to Solidarity, as they saw it, there was still a chance for its healthy, working class current to prevail, not the KOR-instigated anti-socialist, troublemaking elements. President
Jimmy Carter
and President-elect
Ronald Reagan
made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed.
[191]
[199]
In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its
revolutionary
work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways.
[200]
The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to "recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party". On 16 December 1980, the
Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970
was officially unveiled in Gdańsk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.
[201]
Among the mass protests that occurred at that time were the winter
1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała
, the
nationwide warning strike
in the spring of that year and
hunger demonstrations
in summer. The warning strike took place in the aftermath of the
Bydgoszcz events
(March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention.
[199]
Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, but at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.
[202]
Minister Jaruzelski became also prime minister in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.
[191]
[199]
As the economic situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the ruling party of some of its burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.
[203]
The existence of Solidarity and the political liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the
nomenklatura
toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.
[199]
At the State Defense Committee meeting on 13 September (the time of the Soviet
Exercise Zapad-81
maneuvers and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of
martial law
. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.
[191]
[199]
In September and October, the
First Congress of Solidarity
deliberated in Gdańsk. Wałęsa faced activist opposition and was barely elected chairman of the organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the word "social" or "socialized" was repeated 150 times. The congress issued a provocative call for workers in other East European countries, urging them to follow in Solidarity's footsteps.
[191]
[204]
[205]
Locally authorized, increasingly "political" strikes continued. They were characterized as "
wildcats
" by Wałęsa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center. He attempted to reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate
Józef Glemp
on 4 November. At the time of the regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the union had nearly ten million members — almost four times as many as the ruling party.
[206]
Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who then broadcast the (previously manipulated to their advantage) recordings.
[207]
[208]
The government, not consulting Solidarity, adopted a plan of economic measures that could be implemented only by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority.
[208]
In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.
[191]
[199]
[209]
Imposition of martial law
General
Wojciech Jaruzelski
led the
People's Republic
during its final decade and became one of the key players in the systemic transition of 1989-90
On 13 December 1981, claiming that the country was on the verge of economic and civil breakdown and
alleging a danger of Soviet intervention
,
[210]
General
Wojciech Jaruzelski
began a crack-down on Solidarity.
Martial law was declared
, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained.
[25]
Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment.
[209]
Polish state militia (
Milicja Obywatelska
, the police) and paramilitary riot police
ZOMO
suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement.
[211]
A series of violent attacks included the
pacification of Wujek Coal Mine
during which 9 people were killed.
[157]
The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their union; the workers, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment.
[202]
The authorities ultimately succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover.
[195]
The Catholic Church strove to exert a moderating influence on Solidarity before and after the martial law.
[212]
Initially, the regime leadership intended to remold Solidarity into a compliant union, stripped of its intelligentsia advisers and compatible with the state socialist system. The failure to incite most ranking Solidarity leaders to collaborate, especially Wałęsa's refusal to extend any such cooperation, resulted in the government adopting the goal of total liquidation of the union movement.
[213]
Strikes and protests followed, but were not nearly as widespread as those of August 1980.
[202]
The
last mass street demonstrations
that Solidarity was able to muster occurred on 31 August 1982, the second anniversary of the Gdańsk agreements.
[214]
The "
Military Council of National Salvation
" banned Solidarity officially on 8 October.
[215]
Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place throughout the mid-to-late 1980s.
[216]
With all the restrictions, however, "the official cultural realm remained far more open than it was prior to 1980" and "cultural policy continued to be the most open in all of Eastern Europe".
[217]
Among the concessions in the
civil and political rights
area granted by the troubled regime were the establishment of the
Constitutional Tribunal
in 1982 and of the
Polish Ombudsman
office in 1987.
[218]
In the mid-1980s and even as late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, including most of its activists, as likely a thing of the past.
[219]
[220]
It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the
Central Intelligence Agency
.
[221]
[222]
When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities,
Zbigniew Bujak
, head of the union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986.
[171]
But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.
[163]
[d1]
"Market socialism" and systemic implosion
During the chaotic years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered a decade of economic crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years.
[209]
Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market.
[223]
Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.
[220]
Throughout their existence, the governments functioning under General Jaruzelski's leadership (1981-1989) engaged in
market economy
reforms aimed at improving economic performance by eliminating central planning, reducing central bureaucracy, introducing self-management and self-financing of state enterprises and allowing self-government by employee councils. The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy and some of its accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime.
[121]
The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy. Ideological considerations were abandoned and priority was given to pragmatic issues and moves.
[224]
Searching for ways to improve the economy and conscious of its alienation from the industrial working class, the regime turned toward
market
reforms with an increasingly significant from the mid-1980s elite-oriented
liberal
component.
[225]
Marketization
, formalized by a 1988 statute on economic activity, was a process that would continue past the mid-1990s.
[163]
Neoliberal
processes may have been initiated by Deputy Prime Minister Zdzisław Sadowski and the government of
Zbigniew Messner
, then developed further under Minister
Mieczysław Wilczek
(author of the statute) and the government of
Mieczysław Rakowski
.
[225]
"
Market socialism
" was introduced as the regime leaders lost their faith in the socialist system and even
nomenklatura
managers were threatened by the declining economy.
[163]
[223]
The enterprises were to be made independent, self-financing and self-managed, which included workers' councils that were resistant to restructuring.
[223]
[226]
Owners of private businesses did well in the final years of the People's Republic and the number of such entities increased.
[163]
[223]
Foreign investment was also encouraged, but limited marketization failed to deliver an economic turnaround.
[223]
[227]
The practice of centralized economic decision making had not been overcome, while the newly autonomous enterprises moved toward a rather spontaneous and chaotic partial
privatization
of dubious legality; it included elements of
kleptocracy
and had a significant middle-level
nomenklatura
component. On a more basic level, countless ordinary Poles took advantage of the changing attitudes and became involved in a great variety of income-producing activities.
[163]
[223]
[226]
The deepening economic crisis caused a marked deterioration in quality of life of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability.
[220]
Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with
ration cards
(
kartki
) necessary to buy consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest.
[121]
As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit to the
de facto
bankrupt Polish government, access to goods that the Poles needed became even more restricted.
[209]
Most of the scarce resources of Western currency available had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and US$45 billion in 1989.
[121]
[209]
[216]
The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by maintaining a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing
black market
and the development of
shortage economy
.
[228]
The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by such phenomena as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration of biological environment and physical and mental health; mortality rates kept increasing. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration.
[220]
The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.
[163]
Last years of the People's Republic and the transition period
Toward Round Table and semi-free elections
In September 1986, the government declared a general amnesty and began work on a number of meaningful reforms.
[217]
Given the liberalized political environment, Wałęsa was urged to reconvene the National Commission from the time of the First Solidarity, but he refused, preferring to deal with the circle of Solidarity's Expert Commission advisers.
[229]
A National Executive Commission, led by Wałęsa, was openly established in October 1987.
[230]
Other opposition structures such as the
Fighting Solidarity
, the
Federation of Fighting Youth
, the Freedom and Peace Movement (
Ruch Wolność i Pokój
) and the
Orange Alternative
"dwarf" movement founded by
Major Waldemar Fydrych
began organizing street protests in form of colorful happenings that assembled thousands of participants. The liberal periodical
Res Publica
negotiated with the authorities its officially published release.
[163]
In the
1987 Polish political and economic reforms referendum
, 67% of the eligible voters participated and most of them approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically stringent passage requirements self-imposed by the regime.
[231]
The referendum debacle dealt a blow to the process of market-oriented economic reforms, which had been sought by Polish governments since the early 1980s.
[121]
The ruling communist/military establishment slowly and gradually came to realize that a deal of some sort with the opposition would eventually be necessary and would have to include the leading Solidarity figures. Solidarity as such, a labor union representing workers' interests, was unable to reassert itself after the martial law and later in the 1980s was practically destroyed, but preserved in the national consciousness as a myth that facilitated social acceptance of systemic changes previously deemed unthinkable.
[e]
The Solidarity organization as a mass movement, and with it its dominant
social democratic
element (supporters of
democratic socialism
), had been defeated. Solidarity's name had continuously been used, but the opposition movement split to form rival groups of different political orientations. According to a new intellectual consensus, "democracy was grounded not in an active citizenry, as had been argued from the mid-1970s through 1981, but in private property and a free market". The current view no longer entailed broad political participation, emphasizing instead elite leadership and a capitalist economy. Solidarity became a symbolic entity, its activists openly assumed ideological "anti-communist" positions and its leadership moved to the
right
.
[232]
[233]
[234]
[235]
[236]
The historic mass movement was now represented by a small number of individuals, of whom
Lech Wałęsa
,
Tadeusz Mazowiecki
and
Leszek Balcerowicz
were about to assume particularly decisive roles. They were proponents of unfettered
free market
, strongly influenced by the American and West European financial and other interests.
[163]
[212]
[225]
[237]
[n]
[g]
Jaruzelski's Poland depended on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during the rule of the last three conservative Soviet
general secretaries
.
[238]
The
perestroika
and
glasnost
policies of the Soviet Union's new leader,
Mikhail Gorbachev
, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland.
[25]
Gorbachev essentially repudiated the
Brezhnev Doctrine
, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European
satellite states
to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force.
[239]
The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historic opportunity for independent reforms in Poland.
[163]
The hardline stance of US President
Ronald Reagan
was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the
World Bank
and the
International Monetary Fund
and for the Eastern European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed the region toward the West.
[240]
Nationwide strikes
broke out in the spring and summer of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were discontinued after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition.
[166]
[224]
The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring that was in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.
[163]
[232]
[241]
[q]
[o]
Both sides having been prompted by the new international situation and the recent strike wave in Poland,
[166]
[240]
in September 1988 preliminary talks between government representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in
Magdalenka
. Numerous meetings took place involving Wałęsa and the minister of internal affairs, General
Czesław Kiszczak
among others, at that time and in the following year, behind the scenes of the official negotiations conducted then.
[240]
[242]
In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV
Alfred Miodowicz
, chief of the
official trade unions
.
[r]
The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.
[224]
[241]
Apartment block
residences built in People's Poland loom over the urban landscape of the entire country. In the past administratively distributed for permanent use, after 1989 most were sold to residents at discounted prices.
During the PZPR's plenary session of 16-18 January 1989, General Jaruzelski and his ruling formation overcame the Central Committee's resistance by threatening to resign and the party decided to allow re-legalization of Solidarity and to approach its leaders for formal talks.
[230]
[240]
From 6 February to 4 April, 94 sessions of negotiations between 13 working groups, which became known as the "
Round Table Talks
" (Polish:
Rozmowy Okrągłego Stołu
), resulted in political and economic compromise reforms.
[25]
Jaruzelski, Prime Minister
Mieczysław Rakowski
and Wałęsa did not directly participate in the negotiations. The government side was represented by Czesław Kiszczak,
Aleksander Kwaśniewski
, Janusz Reykowski, Stanisław Ciosek, Romuald Sosnowski, Władysław Baka, Andrzej Gdula and
Ireneusz Sekuła
; the Solidarity opposition by
Adam Michnik
, Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
Bronisław Geremek
,
Jacek Kuroń
,
Zbigniew Bujak
,
Władysław Frasyniuk
,
Jarosław Kaczyński
and Witold Trzeciakowski, among others. The talks resulted in the
Round Table Agreement
, by which political power was to be vested in a newly created
bicameral legislature
and in a
president
, who would be the chief executive.
[239]
[243]
By 4 April 1989, numerous reforms and freedoms for the opposition were agreed. Solidarity, now in existence as the
Solidarity Citizens' Committee
, was to be legalized again as a trade union and allowed to participate in
semi-free elections
.
[25]
[239]
This election had restrictions imposed, designed to keep the PZPR in power, since only 35% of the seats in the
Sejm
, the key lower chamber of parliament, would be open to Solidarity candidates. The remaining 65% were to be reserved for candidates from the PZPR and its allies (the
United People's Party
, the
Alliance of Democrats
and the
PAX Association
). Since the Round Table Agreement mandated only reform (not replacement) of "
real socialism
" in Poland, the party thought of the election as a way of neutralizing political conflict and staying in power, while gaining some legitimacy to carry out economic reforms.
[240]
[244]
[245]
However, the negotiated social policies, arrived at by economists and trade unionists during the Round Table talks, were quickly tossed out by both the party and the opposition.
[246]
A systemic transformation happening sooner rather than later was made possible by the
Polish legislative elections
of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the
Tiananmen Square protests
in
China
. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity (caused in part by the
electoral system
that favored the opposition as far as the contested seats were concerned, but was permitted by the government nevertheless)
[247]
surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the
Sejm
, while in the newly established
Senate
they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats. At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The PZPR-led coalition suffered a catastrophic blow to its legitimacy.
[244]
Political transformation
The next few months were spent on political maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. On 19 July 1989 Jaruzelski barely won the vote in the
National Assembly
presidential election
, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.
[245]
Adam Michnik
, an influential leader in the transformation of Poland
The Round Table deal basically allowed the PZPR to remain in power regardless of the election results, and the party's reshuffled leadership continued to rule. On 1 August, prices were freed because of the ongoing market reforms and
hyperinflation
resulted. The instantly increased economic hardship caused a new wave of strikes. The strikes were spontaneous, but the Solidarity leaders, no longer in agreement with the strikers' economic demands, were able to emphasize the secondary political aspect of the strikes (anger at the party's obstinacy) and use them to pressure the regime for an expedited transfer of power.
[248]
The new prime minister, General Kiszczak, who was appointed on 2 August 1989, failed to gain enough support in the
Sejm
to form a government and resigned on 19 August. He was the last communist head of government in Poland. Although Jaruzelski tried to persuade Solidarity to join the PZPR in a "grand coalition", Wałęsa refused. The two formerly subservient parties allied with the PZPR, prompted by the current strike pressure, were moving toward adopting independent courses and their added votes would give the opposition control of parliament.
[239]
[248]
Under the circumstances, Jaruzelski had to come to terms with the prospect of the new government being formed by political opposition. Solidarity elected representative Tadeusz Mazowiecki was appointed prime minister and confirmed by the assembly on 24 August 1989.
[239]
The new government led by a non-communist, the first of its kind in the Soviet Bloc,
[26]
was sworn into office on 13 September.
[v]
The PZPR did not immediately relinquish all power, remaining in the coalition and retaining control of the ministries of foreign trade, defense, interior and transport.
[249]
Mazowiecki's government, forced to deal quickly with galloping hyperinflation, soon adopted
radical economic policies
, proposed by Leszek Balcerowicz, which transformed Poland into a functioning
market economy
under an accelerated schedule. Many Polish
state-owned enterprises
, undergoing
privatization
, turned out to be woefully unprepared for capitalist competition and the pace of their accommodation (or attrition) was rapid.
[239]
[250]
The economic reform, a
shock therapy
accompanied by comprehensive
neoliberal
restructuring,
[251]
was, in reality, an extension of the previous incremental "communist" policies of the 1970s and 1980s, which were now followed by a leap to greatly expanded integration with the
global economy
with little protection.
[s]
Among the reform's negative immediate effects were the economic
recession
and near-paralysis of foreign trade. On longer-term bases, the country experienced quickly rising unemployment and social inequities, as enterprises were liquidated and income was redistributed away from workers and farmers, in favor of the establishment and the entrepreneurial class.
[m]
A
collapse of Polish industry
was among the detrimental consequences of fundamental and lasting importance.
[252]
[l]
[y]
Labor unions underwent further marginalization; Solidarity activity as a labor union, prioritized in the past, was now suppressed.
[253]
[z]
On the positive side, the market price-income reform balanced the economy and brought inflation under control, the currency stabilized, shortages were eliminated and significant foreign investment began.
[252]
The shock therapy solutions were often dictated by Western consultants, of whom
Jeffrey Sachs
was best known but also most criticized.
[225]
[227]
[237]
[239]
[254]
[c]
[f]
The striking electoral victory of Solidarity candidates in the limited elections, and the subsequent formation of the first non-communist government in the region in decades, encouraged many similar peaceful transitions from communist party rule in
Central
and
Eastern Europe
in the second half of 1989.
[255]
In December 1989, changes to the
Polish constitution
were made, officially eliminating the "socialist" order: Marxist references were removed and the name of the country was changed back to the Polish Republic.
[239]
Wałęsa, president of the Solidarity trade union, demanded early presidential elections. He was acting against the advice of his traditional Solidarity allies, intellectuals who were now running the government. Under pressure from the continuing worker unrest, Wałęsa declared himself a supporter of workers' interests, allegedly threatened by those whom he identified as communists (such as President Jaruzelski), or elitist political liberals (such as Prime Minister Mazowiecki). Wałęsa presented himself as a person of good conservative, Christian and nationalist credentials.
[256]
[t]
In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned as Poland's president and was succeeded by Wałęsa, who won the
1990 presidential election
. Lech Wałęsa's inauguration as president took place on 22 December 1990. He distanced himself from Wojciech Jaruzelski by accepting the
prewar
presidential insignia from President-in-Exile
Ryszard Kaczorowski
, who was stepping down.
[239]
Wałęsa defeated Mazowiecki and in the second round
Stanisław Tymiński
, but under his presidency economic policy remained unchanged.
[256]
The historically communist
Polish United Workers' Party
dissolved itself in 1990 and transformed into the
Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland
.
[25]
The
German-Polish Border Treaty
, signed in November 1990, resolved the sensitive for Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his government issue of recognition of Poland's western border by
Germany
, after the country's
unification
.
[257]
The
Warsaw Pact
was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991 and the last
post-Soviet troops
left Poland in September 1993.
[258]
On 27 October 1991, the first (since the 1920s) entirely free
Polish parliamentary election
took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style
liberal democratic political system
.

Notes
a.
The troops were brought in by Minister of Defense
Konstantin Rokossovsky
. Rokossovsky obtained permission from First Secretary
Edward Ochab
, who shared his assessment of the situation: a widespread counterrevolutionary activity that the
militia
and the security forces might be unable to contain.
[259]
b.
As characterized by Jane Hardy, (1956 events were) "...the first cycle of a pattern that would re-emerge with increasing severity over the following decades. A slowdown in the ability of the economy to deliver rising standards of living, followed by revolts triggered by price increases, led to reforms based on decentralisation and worker self-management. Recentralisation, repression and reform followed in its wake." To "...a decline in the rate of economic growth and...a fall in real average wages...the ruling class would react by introducing more control in enterprises, a higher turnover of managerial and political cadres, intensified propaganda against ideological revisionism, the suspension of certain investment projects and the reallocation of investment favouring the consumption goods sector and services." But from the late 1960s, "a policy of extensive growth could no longer deliver positive rates of growth and increasing standards of living."
[40]
c.
Mazowiecki and Balcerowicz had vastly greater freedom of economic action than their predecessors because neither Gierek nor Jaruzelski could consider triggering high unemployment (it would violate the symbolic legitimation of workers as the ruling class). The Western economies responded to crisis situations from the 1970s onward by utilizing the existing free-market flexibilities (deregulation, downsizing, anti-trade union legislation, moving cheap manufacturing to the
Third World
countries etc.) ever more easily under the newly dominant
neoliberal
policies. Such remedies were not available before 1989 for the ruling establishments in Central and Eastern Europe.
[163]
[226]
[260]
d.
Karol Modzelewski
wrote the following on the controversial issue of popular support for communist reforms in Stalinist Poland:
"...the extent of social support for the communist power and its undertakings was considerable. Especially as it regards the rebuilding and industrialization of the country, which before the war belonged to the European underdeveloped zone, widespread dissemination of education and the availability of higher education for the youth from peasant and worker families. The mass social advancement related to such transformations naturally affected the attitudes of millions of people, especially the young, for whom People's Poland opened the previously unavailable opportunities."
Modzelewski qualified this view by stressing the greatly limited access to impartial information. Society was intensely indoctrinated at the official level, while families at home, to protect their youth, refrained from criticizing the regime or discussing issues that were deemed not safe.
[261]
e.
Maciej Gdula summarized Solidarity's demise and its subsequent mythologizing as follows:
"Solidarity was put in a golden sarcophagus and turned into a myth, which was supposed to legitimize the change of 1989. But the movement at that time was dead: it was falling apart already in 1981 and it was finished off by the martial law. However, it was precisely this external termination that opened the possibility of its rebirth as a myth."
[163]
"...the new order was legitimized to a great extent by the myth of Solidarity. The time between the martial law and the
Round Table
had to be compressed to make an impression of continuity. There was a moment of lapse, the story went, but then society woke up again and reclaimed power."
[163]
f.
The Balcerowicz Plan enjoyed a consensus of opinion of Polish legislators, who supported it across the political spectrum, together with President Jaruzelski. However,
Michael Bruno
, chief of advisers of the
International Monetary Fund
, was surprised when Mazowiecki's government chose the harshest of the transformation plans presented by the fund. Jane Hardy argued that "a particularly pernicious ideologically reactionary variant of neoliberalism" had been produced in Poland.
Czechoslovakia
and
Hungary
did not opt for a radical liberal changeover and their systemic conversions resulted in lower than in Poland levels of social inequalities.
[225]
[262]
[263]
According to the economist Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric about the end of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.
[252]
According to Rafał Woś, "...Poland was a
peripheral country
, it moved from one relationship of dependence to another, was in a very weak position. The international financial institutions treated our elites like children, not partners. ... But even then, there was some room for maneuver."
[225]
g.
Among the critics of the prevailing
right wing
ideology and practice of the Polish transformation were
Karol Modzelewski
and
Tadeusz Kowalik
. Other "prescient voices" listed by David Ost were
Ryszard Bugaj
,
Barbara Labuda
, Włodzimierz Pankow and
Józef Pinior
.
[236]
[263]
The Solidarity Working Group, led by
Andrzej Gwiazda
,
Marian Jurczyk
and
Jan Rulewski
, was opposed in 1989 to the course adopted by the PZPR-Solidarity negotiators.
[240]
h.
Employee councils that Solidarity managed to push through survived the martial law and the 1980s, only to be eliminated by
Leszek Balcerowicz
.
[194]
i.
The historian Andrzej Leon Sowa characterized the outcome of the Polish transition as follows: "Part of the
nomenklatura
, combined with the elites originating from the opposition (intelligentsia and middle bureaucracy, forming the new but engendered by the previous system urban class),
[264]
became the beneficiaries of the system that developed over the ruins of People's Poland. As a whole, however, both the PZPR and the worker in its bulk Solidarity lost. The only organization ... strengthened in every respect is the institutional Roman Catholic Church."
[265]
[266]
According to the journalist Kaja Puto, the
2015 Polish parliamentary election
marked Poland's rejection of the myth of successful transformation and the end of the Polish post-communist period.
[267]
Karol Modzelewski sees the 2015 elections and their outcome as a path to collapse of Polish democracy and direct consequence of the faulty systemic transformation, beginning with the destruction of
socialist
industry. The transformation's victims and their descendants have experienced lasting social degradation and became disheartened adversaries of the post-1989 liberal democracy, which failed them and which (in 2015) may have ended.
[268]
[269]
j.
The name
Solidarność
(Solidarity) was proposed by Karol Modzelewski, who also insisted on and pushed through the formation of a single countrywide union. The Expert Commission of the
Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee
thought the idea was unrealistic and planned only to register a number of regional unions.
[185]
The movement remained significantly decentralized though, with local branches enjoying considerable autonomy.
[201]
k.
Uniquely in the Soviet camp, from 1956 Polish institutions of higher learning enjoyed considerable autonomy. Statutory elimination of academic self-rule and existing protections in the area of intellectual freedom was carried out by the authorities following the 1968 unrest.
[194]
[270]
l.
The processes of the Polish transformation resulted in a considerable loss of economic potential and people who depended on such potential were deprived of means to support their existence.
[195]
Gross national income
dropped by over 18% within two years, which in Poland amounted to a deepest
recession
since the
Great Depression
crisis of 1929-33. The ideologically motivated, frenetic
privatization
, a sell-out of best state enterprises for a fraction of their worth, was called by Aleksander Małachowski a "reform by ruin". According to Karol Modzelewski (2013), the psychological, cultural and political consequences of the social degradation experienced still burden everyday life of the Poles and threaten the regained freedom. The trauma of the great transformation has been exploited by right-wing
populists
.
[271]
[272]
David Ost wrote the following (2016), referring to the "post-communist"
Democratic Left Alliance
, its ascent to power and its decline in 1993-1997 and 2001-2005: "Twice before
PiS
first came to power, parties aligned with the liberal left secured strong labor support. But by insisting on marketization, privatization and participation (as a
peripheral
player) in the global capitalist economy, and disparaging demands for more security, they soon squandered that support and ended up driving regular workers into the arms of PiS." Then in 2007-2015, "market liberals of
Civic Platform
... pursued a pragmatic politics of adapting to the
European Union
... while suicidally pursuing a hard agenda against workers." Economic insecurity having fueled the rise of the Right as elsewhere in Europe, "
Kaczyński
won in 2015 by focusing on economic issues" and because of PiS' "promise of economic security".
[273]
m.
Drastic cuts were implemented in
progressive taxation
and public spending, including on
welfare
. Income and wealth were massively redistributed toward a small number of people at the top at the price of impoverishment of a large number at the bottom.
[274]
The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the
European Union
membership came to the rescue.
[275]
As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent economic migration out of the country.
[276]
The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character. Their socially detrimental consequences included the lasting political polarization over the practically limited range of choices: economic liberalism lacking any communal concerns on the one hand, and the conservative, patriarchal and parochial backwaters of Polish nationalism on the other.
[277]
n.
Polish intellectuals and leaders of the 1980s were affected by the shifted economic and political thinking in the West, now dominated by the
neoliberal
and
neoconservative
policies of
Friedrich Hayek
,
Milton Friedman
,
Margaret Thatcher
and
Ronald Reagan
.
[234]
o.
Sixty percent of the Polish workforce were manual laborers (skilled and unskilled) or farmworkers. They had become passive objects in the systemic transition processes, but provided the votes needed by the Solidarity intelligentsia elite in order to achieve its domination and implement the changes that the leaders intended.
[278]
p.
In 1980, according to David Ost, "intellectuals first proclaimed an inseparable
connection
of labor and democracy, thus establishing the claim they would spend most of the rest of the decade trying to dismantle". Later in the 1980s and in the 1990s workers will be defined by intellectuals as irrational, misguided and even dangerous, because of their "illegitimate" opposition to the "necessary", "correct" and "rational" economic policies, pursued especially by the new post-1989 liberal establishment and couched by it in the absolute language of science, not in relative terms of a political debate. Ost concludes that the liberals "got it wrong" and made "their fatal error": they drove the critics of their reform toward an ideological and intolerant
Right
. The abandonment, rejection and exclusion would thus push many workers, labor activists and others into right-wing
populism
and religious nationalism (the marginalized in 1989 but later resurgent illiberal camp), while the liberal elite would pay with a steady erosion of its authority.
[236]
[279]
[280]
The liberals' approach revealed "a fundamental misunderstanding of what democracy is and how best to consolidate it". In the end the liberals, misguided in their belief that "liberal democracy could be grounded solely in private property", ignored in the post-1989 discourse not only the material but also the symbolic and emotional levels. They adopted a hostile attitude toward their labor base and had thus "squandered their moral and political authority", making it possible for the politically illiberal populist Right to fill the resulting societal vacuum. The illiberal Right had been able to flourish by proffering only fictitious enemies and symbolic appeasement.
[196]
q.
David Ost described the situation as follows:
"As democratic reform became a real possibility, intellectuals sought to legitimate their emerging class interests. Political liberalism they shared with labor, but not economic liberalism, which is what they emphasized now. In doing so, they spoke the language that the party was now speaking, which eventually made them attractive partners for the party elite."
[235]
r.
The
All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions
(OPZZ) was established by the government in 1984, following the martial law ban on all trade union activity. It was shunned by underground Solidarity activists, who pressured past Solidarity members and its present sympathizers not to get involved with this initiative.
[248]
s.
Neoliberalism
and
shock therapy
were presented to the Polish public as a rational (scientific, based on
mathematical economics
) and merit-based, nonpolitical and objective system. The supposedly natural (biological) character of the systemic changes was stressed. The Central European myth of the West was used as a justification for the radical economic transformations, but at the same time the Poles were fed the already discredited in Western social sciences argumentation evoking
social Darwinism
.
[272]
t.
Wałęsa'a election campaign and its approach, worked out together with
Jarosław Kaczyński
, according to David Ost amounted to the beginning of Poland's era of "
neoliberal
populism": a practice of transforming social anger provoked by deprivation and economic difficulties through redirecting it to issues and targets that were non-economic, political and unrelated to the causes of that anger.
[256]
While Wałęsa declared a "war at the top" in order to unseat the liberal leaders (his former protégés), his current allies the
Kaczyński
brothers in a related move established a new party, the
Center Alliance
(May 1990). The Alliance combined extreme anti-communism with a pursuit of accelerated neoliberal economic reforms.
[196]
u.
Following the current enforcement activity and in the wake of
citizen discontent
in the following years, a massive expansion of the ORMO force was undertaken; at its peak in 1979 it reached over 450,000 members.
[80]
v.
David Ost identified
Tadeusz Mazowiecki
,
Bronisław Geremek
,
Jacek Kuroń
and
Adam Michnik
as the most influential members of the (formerly opposition) intellectual elite during the early post-communist period. He characterized them as
liberals
in the political, but especially in the economic sense. They "sponsored
Leszek Balcerowicz
and persuaded Wałęsa to approve. ... Their aim was to ... allow painful economic changes and unpopular capitalist class formation to occur".
[281]
"The very language that in 1980 both underpinned and promoted an engaged civil society, providing the theoretical foundation for the struggle against communism, was used after 1989 to legitimate policies aimed at creating and empowering a new dominant class."
[282]
w.
The party leaders, conscious of the 1970 Gomułka's precedent and fearful of its repeat, tried to forestall the price rises but eventually accepted the harsh package forced by Prime Minister
Piotr Jaroszewicz
.
Leonid Brezhnev
and other Soviet leaders applied strong pressure in an attempt to prevent the fateful move by the Polish regime.
[167]
x.
The leftist in the 1960s democratic opposition regrouped in the 1970s in a different form, giving up in process much of its leftist moral affiliation.
Defeated in 1968
by the regime which took advantage of the opposition's social isolation, the opposition activists opted for an alliance with the Polish Catholic Church. The alliance ended the opposition's isolation and legitimated the movement in popular perception. However, the cost for the Left was a surrender of its fundamental value system (the mainstream opposition could thus no longer be considered leftist), and in the long run granting the Right the upper hand in the ability to mobilize mass political support. The opposition's alliance with the Church (before 1989 and after, when it became the ruling establishment) is also responsible, according to the cultural philosopher Andrzej Leder, for the marginalization of the Left and its social concept in the political spectrum of democratic Poland.
[283]
In 1977
Adam Michnik
published his pivotal book
Kościół, lewica, dialog
('The Church, the Left, the dialogue'). It marks the ideological transformation (capitulation in the political and cultural sense) of the opposition movement that soon resulted in the formation and domination in Poland of the
liberal
-
conservative
consensus.
[133]
y.
The old industry left behind well-qualified
workforce
. Its existence turned out to be valuable for a
peripheral economy
resource because Poland became a major (for
international capital
) source of
inexpensive labor
, both inside and outside the country.
[284]
In Poland however, the availability of low-cost labor was used by entrepreneurs as a tool for competitiveness and discouraged investing in technical improvements, creativity and innovation.
[276]
z.
Unlike labor union members in the West, the Polish post-transformation unionist could not conceive of an adversarial or competitive relationship between themselves and the new capitalist owners of their places of employment. In a survey conducted in 1994, most Polish unionists, in both the Solidarity and
OPZZ
main unions, saw their proper role as promoters and facilitators of the market reform and
privatization
processes, not in protecting themselves from the
shock therapy
effects. Such attitude, conditioned by their historical experience and current government propaganda, rendered the workers unable to defend their
class interests
under the new system.
[285]
a1.
The philosopher Andrzej Leder wrote of the post-war "departure from the mentality defined by the
village
and
folwark
toward one determined by the city and urban lifestyle", which facilitated the later expansion of the
middle class
in Poland.
[286]
Between 1956 and 1968 the modern urban culture was established, and the entire 1944-1989 period meant irreversible destruction of the previously existing social and
class
barriers, including the realms of culture and customs.
[287]
b1.
Andrzej Leder gives the following figures, quoting
Andrzej Paczkowski
and Henryk Słabek. Of the 4.7 million people who populated the
Recovered Territories
in 1945-1950, 2.9 million came from central and south-eastern provinces of the new Polish territory and over 1.5 million from what had become the Soviet Union; smaller numbers of settlers arrived from France, Germany and other countries. From February 1946 to the end of 1948, 2.2 million Germans had to leave Poland (Paczkowski). 2.8 million Poles returned to Poland after the war from Germany and other parts of Western Europe (out of the total of 3.0-3.5 million war-displaced who were present there) and many of them settled in the Recovered Territories. (Słabek).
[288]
c1.
Andrzej Leder wrote (2014) of the mass migration from rural areas to urban centers: "The consequence ... of the extermination during the German occupation of Jewish urban people and the destruction by Stalinist communism of the dominant position of state functionary, military and intellectual elites originating from
szlachta
, was the creation of an enormous and multi-dimensional sphere for advancement. Cities became widely open and were rapidly overtaken by all those who bothered to make the move. Such people, actually their children and grandchildren, today make-up the basic skeleton of social structure.
[91]
d1.
According to Andrzej Leder, Jaruzelski's martial law (supported at the time of its imposition by about 50% of Poles) and its aftermath have had strongly deleterious long-term effects on social and political developments in Poland. The trauma caused by the deprivation of the collective sense of self-determination (acquired during the Solidarity period) atomized society and prevented future politically moderate and socially responsible undertakings and movements, creating a social vacuum, which was eventually filled by individualistic
neoliberalism
and right-wing
nationalism
.

Cross country running competition in Japan
Fukuoka International Cross Country
Date
Late February or
early March
Location
Fukuoka
,
Japan
Event type
Cross country
Distance
10 km for men
4 km for women
8 km junior men
6 km junior women
Established
1987
The
Fukuoka International Cross Country
is an annual
cross country running
competition which takes place in
Fukuoka
,
Japan
in either late February or Early March. It is one of the
IAAF
permit meetings which serve as qualifying events for the
IAAF World Cross Country Championships
.
[1]
First held in 1987, the Fukuoka Cross Country is held at the National Cross Country Course near the
Uminonakamichi Seaside Park
in
Higashi-ku, Fukuoka
.
[2]
The course is a purpose-built cross country venue that was created as the host course for the
2006 IAAF World Cross Country Championships
.
[3]
The meet features a competition schedule of eight races.
[4]
These include a senior men's course (10 km) and a senior women's course (6 km). A total of four junior races take place, with long courses of 8 km for men and 6 km for women, as well as 4 km short course for both junior sexes. Furthermore, there are two
relay races
for
high school
athletes which have legs of 2 km per runner.
[2]
Four of the races act as qualifiers for the World Cross Country Championship: the men's 10 km and the women's 6 km allow athletes to enter the senior world competition while the junior men's 8 km and junior women's 6 km enable runners to qualify for the junior section of the championships.
[4]
The competition is one of three in which Japanese athletes can qualify for the World Championships; the others being the annual
Chiba International Cross Country
and the biennial
Asian Cross Country Championships
.
[5]
A small contingent of foreign athletes are invited each year, but the fields of each race largely comprise Japanese runners.
[6]
Previous winners include Olympic gold medallist
Samuel Wanjiru
, who first won at the age of 16,
[7]
and won three times consecutively between 2003 and 2005.
[8]
World and Olympic gold medallist
Meseret Defar
has also competed, winning the 2005 women's race.
The competition is televised on local
Japan News Network
channels by the
Tokyo Broadcasting System
.
[2]
The Fukuoka Cross Country meeting is one of the prefecture's top annual
athletics
events, along with the
Fukuoka International Open Marathon Championship
.

old-time radio
. Her last name was also sometimes transcribed as
Delys
.
[4]
Early years
[
edit
]
Born in
Edmonton
, Alberta, Canada, DeLys performed in a talent show while she was a law student at
USC
. A talent scout saw her and turned her career plans from law to singing.
[5]
Career
[
edit
]
Dubbed "the Canadian Canary" by newspaper columnist
Walter Winchell
, DeLys was active professionally from the 1920s into the 1940s.
[5]
In 1928, she performed in vaudeville shows headed by
Eddie Peabody
[4]
and
Paul Ash
.
[6]
Prior to January 1931, DeLys had moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles, singing on radio station

[7]
By June 1931, DeLys had become the female vocalist with
Georgie Stoll

A German personalised stamp
A
personalised
(or
personalized
)
stamp
is a
postage stamp
on which, for a fee, an image and/or text of the purchaser's choosing may be placed. The stamps vary from country to country, and while some are normal stamps with a personalised label on the left attached by perforations, elsewhere the stamps are more properly regarded as one-piece personalised
meter stamps
with a colourful design next to the
indicia
. Stamps produced by Zazzle.com for the United States, for instance, are one-piece, self-adhesive with die cut margins to emulate perforations, and visually very similar to normal United States postage stamps, except for the addition of an information-based indicia (IBI) encoded by little black and white squares along one edge. A serial number appears next to the IBI.
Usage
[
edit
]
Examples given by
postal authorities
who offer this service usually depict family members, pets or other uncontroversial
[1]
subjects but users quickly realised that they could place almost any image in its space. For instance, there have been attempts to publicise missing persons,
[2]
promote political causes such as
Tamil independence
, or to place the image of criminals or other controversial individuals on its stamps. The rules of most countries generally prohibit such things, however, stamp producers may not spot every attempt to circumvent their rules, particularly when it is not obvious who or what is being depicted, or that the image has some political or other significance.
Austria
[
edit
]
The Austrian Postal Service
[3]
has permitted personalisation of postage stamps. In Austria the
denomination
of personalised stamps can now be changed as well.
Bhutan
[
edit
]
Bhutan Post
issued the first personalised stamps in 2008.
[4]
The stamps are issued in mini-sheets of 12 stamps with a large illustration at the left highlighting a Bhutan issue. Each stamp is framed, providing a blank space in the middle for a personal picture or company logo. In 2019 the tenth different personalised stamp sheet has been issued. Personalised stamps are especially popular with tourists.
[5]
India
[
edit
]
My Stamp
is the brand name for personalised stamps of
India Post
.
Indonesia
[
edit
]
An example of Prisma stamp
Personalised stamps or
Prisma
(PRangko IdentitaS Milik Anda - "your identity stamp", but also Indonesian for a
prism
) were launched in Indonesia in 2003.
[6]
The guidelines allow the stamps to show portraits of one or more people, writing or signatures, logos, symbols, and slogans,  and advertisements of products and services.
[6]
Malta
[
edit
]
MaltaPost introduced personalised stamps in 2005.
[7]
These consist of personalised labels adjoining a stamp, and MaltaPost continues to offer this service as of 2020.
[8]
The Netherlands
[
edit
]
PostNL
provides the possibility to make personalised stamps. A blank space in the middle of the stamp can be used for a personal picture, drawing, company logo, etc. The customer can choose from a number of different denominations (domestic rate, international rate or the special December rate).
[9]
The United Kingdom
[
edit
]
Royal Mail
has permitted personalisation of labels adjoining their stamps.
[1]
The stamps are produced in small sheets known as
smilers sheets
.
The United States
[
edit
]
A personalised stamp provided by Zazzle.com
In the United States, personalised stamps - also known as customized postage - are technically a form of meter labels and are governed by the
United States Postal Service
. As "a form of meter labels", they are not supposed ("they are not required") to be cancelled for postal purposes. Instead, a scanning machine at the post office is supposed to scan and void the postal value of that personalised stamp. For philatelic purposes, the postmarking of a personalised stamp is permitted, and it is harmless to USPS. In fact, a visible postmark is a further protection of revenue for USPS, since a postmarked personalised stamp is far less likely to be re-affixed on a mail piece for another mailing. While consumers may find that customized postage is available in a number of retail and online outlets, the USPS has authorized different companies to handle selected aspects of the program.
Providers,
including
Pitney Bowes
, Endicia and
Stamps.com
, are authorized to generate, transmit and print the indicia barcodes, ensure that images conform to USPS standards, market and sell customized postage and fulfill customer orders.
Partners
such as Zazzle can approve imagery, market, sell and fulfill orders, but they must be associated with an authorized provider who creates the indicia using an approved postage evidencing system.
Affiliates
like
Fuji
can market, sell and fulfill orders, but are not authorized to approve imagery or print postage and must be associated with an authorized provider who creates the indicia using an approved postage evidencing system.

Stamps.com,

Zazzle.com
and Fuji offer USPS-approved personalised postage via Stamp Expressions,

PhotoStamps
[13]
and ZazzleStamps and Yourstamps.com respectively.
Consumers and businesses may also print their own postage using a small, specialized, printer, such as the Pitney Bowes Stamp Expressions Printer.

Recent innovations include postal kiosks, where consumers can download an image at their local convenience store.
In June 2020, USPS has terminated the program for customized postage (personalised stamps) from all its officially-licensed vendors.
Whoever wants to design personalised stamps can do so in about 60 other countries. Not in USA or UK, anymore.
Choice of images
[
edit
]
Although most postal regulations permit the exclusion of "objectionable" pictures on the stamps, in 2004
The Smoking Gun
managed to create personalised stamps featuring the
Rosenbergs
,
Jimmy Hoffa
,
Ted Kaczynski
,
Monica Lewinsky's dress
,
Slobodan Milošević
and
Nicolae Ceauşescu
using the service offered by stamps.com.
[15]
The firm subsequently revised its policies.
Stamps for hunters
[
edit
]
In 2006 Ed Owens of REACT Consulting Group, a lobbyist for the Hunters Heritage Council,  complained to the
U.S. Postmaster General
when Zazzle.com refused to create a personalised stamp that promoted hunters as conservationists. The stamp would have borne the legends "$1.7 Billion for Conservation Annually" and "Sportsmen... America's First Conservationists". The creation of the stamp was refused because, Zazzle said, it "Incorporates material that is primarily partisan, or political, in nature." REACT Consulting cited stamps created for the
Humane Society of the United States
(HSUS) which it said were also partisan and political but which had been accepted for production.
[16]
Zazzle eventually withdrew the HSUS stamps.

activist
Emma Hart Willard
(February 23, 1787 - April 15, 1870) was an American
female education
activist who dedicated her life to education. She worked in several schools and founded the first school for women's higher education in the
United States
, the
Troy Female Seminary
in
Troy, New York
. With the success of her school, Willard was able to travel across the country and abroad, to promote education for women. The seminary was renamed the
Emma Willard School
in 1895 in her honor.
Early life
[
edit
]
Emma Willard was born on February 23, 1787, in
Berlin, Connecticut
.
[1]
She was the sixteenth of seventeen children from her father, Samuel Hart, and his second wife Lydia Hinsdale Hart.
[2]
Her father was a farmer who encouraged his children to read and think for themselves. At a young age, Willard's father recognized her passion for learning. At that time women were only provided basic education, but Willard was included in family discussions such as politics, philosophy, world politics and mathematics that were primarily male subjects.
[3]
At age 15, Willard was enrolled in her first school in 1802 in her hometown of Berlin. She progressed so quickly that just two years later at the age of 17 she was teaching there.  Willard eventually took charge of the academy for a term in 1806.
[4]
Career
[
edit
]
In 1807, Willard left Berlin and briefly worked in
Westfield, Massachusetts
, before accepting a job offer at a female academy in
Middlebury, Vermont
. She held the position of principal at the academy  from 1807 to 1809. She was unimpressed by the material taught there and opened a boarding school for women, the
Middlebury Female Seminary
in 1814, in her own home.
[5]
She was inspired by the subjects her nephew, John Willard, was learning at
Middlebury College
and strove to improve the curriculum that was taught at girls' schools.
[4]
Willard believed that women could master topics like mathematics and philosophy rather than just subjects taught at
finishing schools
. This passion for women's education led her to fight for the first women's school for higher education.
Emma Willard
Her success inspired her to share her ideas on education and to write
A Plan for Improving Female Education
in 1819, a pamphlet that she presented to the members of the
New York Legislature
. Her plan included a proposal for a women's seminary to be publicly funded just as men's schools were.
[3]
Willard did not receive a response from the legislators, several of whom believed women's education to be contrary to God's will. Willard finally received support from New York Governor
DeWitt Clinton
, who invited her to open a school there.
[4]
Originally Willard opened an institution in
Waterford, New York
but she did not receive the promised financial support and therefore moved her school to
Troy, New York
, where she received more support and funding.
[6]
The
Troy Female Seminary
opened in September 1821, for boarding and day students.
[1]
This was the first school in the United States to offer higher education for women. The curriculum consisted of the subjects she had longed to include in women's education: mathematics, philosophy, geography, history, and science.
[3]
Willard led the school to success, and in 1831, the school had enrolled over 300 students.
[2]
The school attracted students from wealthy families or families of high position. Although most of the students would still end up as housewives, Willard never hindered her students' pursuit towards women's education and continued to fight for their rights. Despite her reputation today in women's history, Willard was not a supporter of the
women's suffrage
movement during the mid-19th century. Willard believed that women's education was a much more important matter.
[2]
When Emma Willard addressed the
New York State Legislature
in 1819, the year before, for example,
Thomas Jefferson
wrote a letter in which he suggested women should not read novels "as a mass of trash" with few exceptions. "For like reason, too, much poetry should not be indulged." Emma Willard told the legislature that the education of women "has been too exclusively directed to fit them for displaying to advantage the charms of youth and beauty". The problem, she said, was that "the taste of men, whatever it might happen to be, has been made into a standard for the formation of the female character." Reason and religion teach us, she said, that "we too are primary existences... not the satellites of men."
Marriage and family
[
edit
]
The
Emma Willard House
in Middlebury
While working at the academy in Middlebury, Willard met her future husband
John Willard
.
[7]
He was a physician and 28 years her senior.
[2]
John Willard brought four children to the marriage from his previous marriages. His nephew, also named John Willard, lived with them while attending Middlebury College, which gave Emma Willard much inspiration in forming her educational views.
[8]
Emma Willard's younger sister,
Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps
, joined Emma in 1823, after the death of her first husband, Simeon Lincoln, and taught at Troy Female Seminary for eight years.
[9]
Emma and John Willard had one son together, named John Willard Hart, who received the management of the Troy Female Seminary when Willard left it in 1838.  Emma's first husband died in 1825, and in 1838, she married Christopher C. Yates but was divorced from him in 1843.
[8]
Works
[
edit
]
Along with the profits made from the Troy Female Seminary, Willard also made a living from her writing. She wrote several textbooks throughout her lifetime, including books on history and geography. Some of her works are
History of the United States, or Republic of America
(1828),
A System of Fulfillment of a Promise
(1831),
A Treatise on the Motive Powers which Produce the Circulation of the Blood
(1846),
Guide to the Temple of Time and Universal History for Schools
(1849),
Last Leaves of American History
(1849),
Astronography; or Astronomical Geography
(1854), and
Morals for the Young
(1857).
[2]
Willard's history and geography texts included women as well as men and emphasized the status of women as the primary determinant in whether a society could be described as civilized.
[10]
Her map-drawing geographic pedagogy became popular in the United States
[11]
and also influential in American missionary schools in South Asia during the nineteenth century.
[12]
Willard also published a book of poetry,
The Fulfilment of a Promise
(1831) with her most popular poem entitled "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep," which she reportedly wrote while on an ocean voyage in 1839.
[4]
[13]
In 1830, she made a tour of Europe. Three years later, she donated the proceeds from her book about her travels
[14]
to a school for women that she helped to found in
Athens, Greece
. This book
Letters from France & Britain
was reviewed alongside
Abby Jane Morrell's
account of her travels in the sub Antarctic and they were described as "the productions of our self-taught countrywomen who [are] ... creditable to their sex".
[15]
Atlas and geography textbooks
[
edit
]
Willard cowrote
The Woodbridge and Willard Geographies and Atlases
(1823), with American geographer
William Channing Woodbridge
;
[16]
Also with Woodbridge she co-authored
A System of Universal Geography on the Principles of Comparison and Classification
.
[17]
Willard and Woodbridge created the first widely used historical atlas of the U.S. The maps, graphs, and pictures integrated the details of the nation's geography into the broad popular image of the country as a large, powerful complex nation.
[18]
She has been the subject of several biographies.
[19]
Her geographies are discussed by Calhoun
[20]
and her histories by Baym.
[21]
Later life and death
[
edit
]
undated photo
Emma Willard Memorial
John Willard, Emma's husband, died in 1825. She headed the Troy Female Seminary until she remarried in 1838, and left the school in the hands of her son and daughter-in-law. She married Dr. Christopher Yates and moved to Boston with him.
[1]
He gave up his career, and after nine months of marriage they separated and a
Decree nisi
was granted in 1843. She spent her later years traveling across America and throughout Europe to promote women's education. In support of her efforts, she published a number of articles and presented lectures across the country to promote the cause. Her personal assistant was
Celia M. Burleigh
. Willard's efforts helped to establish a school for women in
Athens, Greece
.
[3]
Emma Willard died on April 15, 1870, in Troy, New York and was interred at
Oakwood Cemetery
.
Legacy and honors
[
edit
]
The Troy Female Seminary was renamed the
Emma Willard School
in 1892, in her honor and today is still promoting her strong belief in women's education.
[1]
A statue honoring her services to the cause of higher education was erected in Troy in 1895.
A marble
memorial
was erected in Middlebury in 1941. In 1905, Willard was inducted into the
Hall of Fame for Great Americans
in the
Bronx, New York
. In 2013, Willard was inducted into the
National Women's Hall of Fame
.

On June 21, 2011, John Cooper posted that the band rehearsed new music for the first time and that they were getting ready for a new album,
[13]
recording a new record in January/February 2012. However, the band was then scheduled to headline the WinterJam Tour.
In an Interview on January 26, 2013 in Beaumont TX, John announced that the new album would be titled
Rise
and would be coming out in May 2013,
[14]
[15]
but was later scheduled for a June 25, 2013 release.
[7]
[16]
"Sick of It" was released via the
iTunes Store
on April 9, 2013.
[17]
The lead Christian radio single, "American Noise", was released on April 16, 2013.

According to Howard Benson, the album was not meant to be a concept album at first, but suggested making it one after reading Pete Townsend's book on
Tommy
and
Quadrophenia
. John Cooper was hesitant because the focus on the concept can result in inferior songs. But as the band fine-tuned the songs, a story began to take shape.

[32]
USA Today
[33]
The album has received mostly positive reviews. At
CCM Magazine
, Matt Conner told that "fans might not appreciate some of the newer flavors", however he evoked that "Skillet refuses to rest on their laurels."
[22]
Mary Nikkel of New Release Tuesday called this "an achievement well worth the wait, and it promises to set the bar high in the rock and roll genre for years to come."
[31]
In addition, Jonathan Francesco of New Release Tuesday wrote that "
Rise
is the quintessential album of the year and one destined to go down in the history books", which he called "the music is epic and memorable, with every song a classic in the making."
[32]
At Jesus Freak Hideout, Roger Gelwics wrote that the album is a "set to frustrate, enthrall, and polarize".
[27]
Lee Brown of Indie Vision Music said that the release is "boldly devoted from start to finish."
[26]
Mike Rimmer at
Cross Rhythms
felt that "For those who have ears to hear, there's enough here to radically change lives."
[23]
At
HM
, Sarah Brehm stated that "as a whole,
Rise
is a decent rock album that helps revive the band after the mediocre
Awake
, yet it's still unable to rise above the impressively unique sound Skillet perfected during their classic years."
[25]
Chad Bowar of
Loudwire
wrote that this album is "a better album" than their previous offering
Awake
, when he said that the album "songwriting has more depth, there's added diversity, the concept and lyrics are interesting and uplifting without being preachy", and that "current Skillet fans will find plenty to like, and new fans will be attracted to the album as well."
[29]
At
USA Today
,
Brian Mansfield
highlighted that "the band pushes its musical limits with a coming-of-age tale that begins in a world that appears irreparably broken."
[33]
Tim Ferrar of
Music Is My Oxygen
rated the album four-and-a-half-out-of-five-stars, and told that this is "incredible music", yet "as a band, Skillet have floundered a bit in recent years, but with
Rise
, they have found fresh footing, producing an album that is likely to stand as a hallmark for their career."
[34]
At
About.com
, Kim Jones rated the album a perfect five stars, and wrote that "Skillet really did rise above the norm and their previous projects with
Rise
", and that "each and every song is a masterpiece in its own right."
[35]
Johan Wippsson of
Melodic.net
felt this was a "very stable release that [he's] pretty sure that most fans will receive in a positive way!"
[30]
At Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies affirmed that their "momentum is set to continue."
[36]
However,
Allmusic
's James Christopher Monger wrote that the album has "such a vague story, despite numerous evocative, yet largely unnecessary between-song interludes, yields little in the way of any kind of investable, individual emotional arc, but the more general themes of self-discovery, faith, love, and loss resonate enough to pull at least one of the listeners feet into the story."
[21]
At
Daily News
, Jim Farber told that the album is "pure exploitation, milking today’s headlines as crassly as their sound does radio’s most cynical demands."
[24]
Ryan Barbee of Jesus Freak Hideout said that "Skillet can do better" because "lyrically, the album feels lacking and musically redundant", yet "the truth is, there are some listeners who will absolutely love this album: they'll relate to the lyrical content and they'll feel the music", however "unfortunately, for many others, they will be left wanting; and honestly they will be vindicated in their thought."

The song is a mid-tempo ballad in
triple meter
. In it, the male narrator is talking to the man who is about to marry his daughter, telling him that he is having difficulty giving her away because he "loved her first." The song is a signature Father-Daughter song to dance to at wedding receptions for numerous brides and their fathers.
Critical reception
[
edit
]
Deborah Evans Price, of
Billboard
magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling it a "beautifully written tearjerker that will hit home with dads everywhere who can't believe their little girls have grown up so soon." She calls Albert's performance "wonderful" and says that it "wrings every drop of emotion from the tender lyric."

Music video
[

Chart performance

"I Loved Her First" debuted at number 57 on the U.S.
Billboard

viral video

When Mickey reads something in a jokebook stating that one out of every four children born is Chinese, he begins to worry that his new baby brother or sister will be Chinese as well. The Gang put Mickey at ease by telling him that it will not be so bad to have a Chinese sibling. The gang then introduce Mickey to Spanky's friend Lee Wong. Once he has learned that people are people no matter what their ethnic background, Mickey is happy—until he discovers that his much-anticipated "kid brother" is not only a girl, but twins to boot.

St. John's United Church of Christ
is a church in
Douglas Township
in
Bremer County, Iowa
.  Founded in 1874 by
German
settlers in the area of the now-defunct town of
Siegel
.  The church has been in continuous operation and remains active, although the membership has declined from its high in the 1920s.
History of the church
[
edit
]
German settlers in the area of Siegel formed
St. Paul's Lutheran Church of Siegel
, in 1872.  When differences arose either over a conflict concerning the burial of one of the members of that church or due to dogmatic differences between adherents of the
Lutheran church
and those of the
German Evangelical Synod of North America
, 18 members under the leadership of Reverend P. Hagemann broke away to form St. John's Church of Siegel on February 22, 1874. The first pastor was Rev. David Kurz.
[1]
The founding members secured a 5-acre (20,000 m
2
) plot in Douglas Township in Bremer County on which they proceeded to build a church with living quarters for the minister in the rear and cemetery. In 1889, during the tenure of Rev. John Reinecke, the church built a separate parsonage.
[1]
In 1897, a schoolhouse was built to the south of the church and parsonage.  In 1922, the current church building was dedicated and in 1924, the church celebrated its 50th anniversary.  The current parsonage was built in 1925.
The church was originally affiliated with the German Evangelical Synod of North America, which joined with another denomination of German background, the
Reformed Church in the United States
, to form the
Evangelical and Reformed Church
in 1934. This church united in 1957 with the General Council of
Congregational Christian Churches
to form the
United Church of Christ
.
At its largest, the church had a membership of almost 400 members in the 1920s.
Today
[
edit
]
St. John's Church has about 80 members and an active
Christian
education program.  The pastor is the Rev. Eugene Walther, a native of the area, who was called to the church in 1973.

He was one of the leading members of the
Association for Yugoslav Democratic Initiative
, and after that he was the leader of the League of Social Democrats and head of the Social Democrat Alliance of Croatia - Social Democrat Alliance of Yugoslavia.
[6]
He was the founder of the
Serb Democratic Forum
and its first president until 1995.
[7]
At the beginning of 1995, he participated in the founding of the Independent Serb Party and of the
Action of Social Democrats of Croatia
.
[7]
He was involved in the activity of that party and as their representative, he entered the
Sabor
after elections held in 1995.
[7]
He cast the decisive vote needed to achieve the two-thirds majority necessary to amend the Croatian Constitution on 12 December 1997. It was the first amending of the Constitution since its adoption on 22 December 1990, and the major amendments included the investiture of the
Croatian War of Independence
into the Constitution's text, as well as the adoption of articles prohibiting the beginning of negotiations on
Croatia
's entrance into associations with any former
Yugoslav
republics and articles defining the national minorities of Croatia. After that, he founded the
Independent Democratic Serb Party
, led by
Vojislav Stanimirović
who was the mayor of Vukovar during the Croatian War of Independence.  On the list of that party, he was a candidate for the
Croatian Parliament
several times. He succeeded Stanimirović as the president of the party in July 2017.

Chemical process
Dehydrogenation of amine-boranes
or
dehydrocoupling of amine-boranes
is a
chemical process
in
main group
and
organometallic chemistry
wherein
dihydrogen
is released by the coupling of two or more amine-borane
adducts
. This process is of due to the potential of using
amine-boranes
for
hydrogen storage
.
Catalysis
[
edit
]
Many metal complexes catalyze the dehydrogenation of amine-borane (AB). Catalysis in the absence of metals has also been observed.
[1]
Pathways
[
edit
]
The dehydrogenation of AB would in principle afford (H
2
BNH
2
)
n
and (HBNH)
n
. The monomers (n = 1) are highly unstable with respect to oligomerization.
Metal carbonyl catalysts
[
edit
]
Group 6
metal carbonyls
upon photolytic activation catalyze dehydrogenation of AB.
[2]
Secondary
amine-boranes
dehydrogenate to form cyclic dimers, or monomeric aminoboranes in the case of more bulky groups on the amine. Similarly, primary
amine-boranes
dehydrogenate through a two step intramolecular process to give aminoborane polymers, which further dehydrogenate to form borazines.
[2]
[CpFe(CO)
2
]
2
is also an effective precatalyst, requiring photolytic activation. The two step process is proposed to occur first by dehydrogenation of the amine-borane coordinated to the metal, followed by cyclodimerization in an off-metal step.
[1]
Rhodium and iridium catalysts
[
edit
]
The first catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ABs were derived from reduction of Rh(I) complexes to form the active colloidal
heterogeneous catalyst
.
[1]
As in the case with the metal carbonyl catalysts, bulky secondary amine-boranes form monomeric aminoboranes. For RhL
2
- and Rh(H)
2
L
2
-derived catalysts, the active species is a homogeneous catalyst, with the phosphine ligands interacting directly with the dehydrocoupling process.
[3]
Changing the phosphine ligands from P
i
Pr
3
to P
i
Bu
3
significantly increases the turnover rate of the catalyst.
[3]
Unlike other Rh(I) catalysts, the rhodium analogue of
Wilkinson's catalyst
RhCl(PHCy
2
)
3
(Cy=cyclohexyl) behaves like the RhL
2
and Rh(H)
2
L
2
catalysts as a homogeneous species.
[1]
In comparison to RhCl(PHCy
2
)
3
, the iridium analogue has reduced catalytic activity on the dehydrogenation of non sterically hindered
amine-boranes
, and increased activity on more sterically hindered substrates.
[1]
Dehydrocoupling of primary diborazanes NH
2
R—BH
2
—NHR—BH
3
can be catalyzed by
Brookhart's catalyst
via conversion to the metal-bound species MeNH—BH
2
and subsequent polymerization/oligomerization. This same reaction has been found to occur in the absence of the iridium metal, upon heating of the reaction mixture.
[1]
Dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane with Brookhart's catalyst results in quantitative formation of the cyclic pentamer [NH
2
BH
2
]
5
rather than the typically seen cyclic dimers from other amine-borane dehydrogenations.
[4]
When catalyzing ammonia-borane dehydrogenation, the catalyst acts homogeneously at a 0.5 mol% catalyst loading.
[4]
Rather than the typical high temperatures needed for this dehydrogenation, the reaction proceeds cleanly at room temperature, with complete substrate conversion in 14min.
[4]
Metallocenes
[
edit
]
Group 4
metallocenes
also catalyze dehydrogenation of ABs.  Activity is affected by metal (Ti > Zr > Hf) and inhibited by bulk. Unlike other catalytic processes, the reaction proceeds via a linear aminoborane [NR
2
BH
2
]
2
, which then cyclodimerizes through a dehydrocoupling process on the metal.
[1]
Most of the zirconocene complexes contain the zirconium in the +4 oxidation state, and the systems are not very active catalysts for amine-borane dehydrogenation.
[5]
In contrast to these systems, the cationic zirconocene complex [Cp
2
ZrOC
6
H
4
P(
t
Bu)
2
]
+
effectively catalyzes the reaction, with the most notable example being the dehydrogenation of dimethylamineborane in 10min at room temperature.
[5]
Potential applications
[
edit
]
Hydrogen storage
[
edit
]
Main article:
Hydrogen Storage
Dehydrogenation of amine-boranes is thermodynamically favourable, making the process attractive for hydrogen storage systems.
Ammonia borane
has attracted particular interest due to its high weight percent of hydrogen (19.6%).
[6]
[7]
Dehydrogenation occurs in three steps, creating polyamino-boranes and
borazines
as insoluble side products.
[6]
[7]
The dehydrogenation reactions are irreversible, which limits the utility of this process for hydrogen storage.
Hydrogen transfer
[
edit
]
Amine-borane dehydrogenation can be coupled with hydride transfer to unsaturated functional groups, usually
olefins
in an
anti-Markovnikov
fashion.
[8]
[9]
Hydroboration of the olefin and release of H
2
from the amine-borane occur in parallel reactions, reducing the percent of olefin reduced.

Lore of American TV series
The television series
Lost
includes a number of mysterious elements that have been ascribed to
science fiction
or
supernatural
phenomena, usually concerning
coincidences
,
synchronicity
,
déjà vu
, temporal and
spatial anomalies
,
paradoxes
, and other puzzling phenomena. The creators of the series refer to these as part of the
mythology
of the series.
[1]
The Island
[
edit
]
As the main setting of the series, the island boasts a number of unusual properties. Its location changes at times and it cannot be reached by ordinary means. The island is surrounded by some sort of barrier which causes
disruptions in the normal flow of time
for those who cross it.
Electromagnetic
phenomena are common on the island, and it seems to bestow unusual
healing
properties to its residents.
Structures
[
edit
]
The
Black Rock
[
edit
]
Located deep inside the jungle is the
Black Rock
, a
sailing ship
from the mid-19th century. In "
Ab Aeterno
", the
Black Rock
set sail in 1867 and was captained by
Magnus Hanso
and had
Richard Alpert
, a Spaniard by the name of Ricardo, as a prisoner.
Jacob
, the protector of the island, does not deny when asked by
his fraternal twin brother
if he brought the ship to the island, as the two watch it approaching. Eventually, it is swept inland by a colossal
rogue wave
, destroying all but one foot of the coastal statue of
Taweret
on its way, but a mystery remains as to how the
Black Rock
had landed on almost the other side of the Island from where the statue of Taweret was. In "
The Constant
", it is explained that the
Black Rock
set sail from
Portsmouth
,
England
, on March 22, 1845 on a trading mission to the
Kingdom of Siam
, when she was tragically lost at sea. The only known artifact of this journey is the journal of the ship's
First Mate
, which was discovered seven years later among the artifacts of
pirates
on
Île Sainte-Marie
,
Madagascar
. The contents of this journal have never been made public nor known to anyone outside the family of the seller Tovard Hanso. This journal is later bought at auction by
Charles Widmore
.
In "
Exodus
",
John Locke
mentions that this ship must have been en route to a mining colony, probably set-off from the Eastern Coast of Africa,
Mozambique
. The ship contains dynamite, mining equipment and several chained skeletons, which are revealed to be enslaved people carried by the ship. Dr. Leslie Arzt (
Daniel Roebuck
) mentions that a
tsunami
could have swept it a couple of miles inland as seen later in the episode.
The Swan
's
blast door
map has a revision marking "Known Final Resting Place of Magnus Hanso /
Black Rock
" as seen in "
Live Together, Die Alone
".
The cabin
[
edit
]
The cabin was built by
the Dharma Initiative
mathematician
Horace Goodspeed
as a sort of
retreat
for himself and his wife. It is surrounded by a broken ash circle. While at first it is believed that Jacob resides there, it is actually the
Man in Black
[
citation needed
]
in the cabin, falsely giving orders on behalf of Jacob. The cabin has appeared in three separate locations.
The lighthouse
[
edit
]
In "
Lighthouse
", Jacob instructs
Hurley
to take
Jack
to a heretofore-unseen lighthouse on the Island's coast. At the top of the lighthouse's stone tower is a set of mirrors which can rotate via a large stone dial, labeled with numbers and in some cases the names of the "candidates". Jack is able to see an image of his childhood home reflected in the mirrors when they are turned to his number, 23; whether this is due to some property of the lighthouse mirrors and structure or simply to Jacob's influence is unclear.
The ruins
[
edit
]
There are ruins on the Island, many with hieroglyphs. In "
Live Together, Die Alone
", while at sea,
Sayid
,
Jin
, and
Sun
sight the remnants of a massive statue standing upon a rock in the surf. All that is left is a large, four-toed marble foot broken off at the ankle. Sayid remarks that he does not know which is more disquieting: the fact that the rest of the statue is missing, or that the foot has only four toes. It has been compared to the
Colossus of Rhodes
.
[2]
The full statue, viewed from the back, appears from a distance in the fifth-season episode "
LaFleur
". The statue seen from behind has lion-like ears, a crown on the head, long hair, an
ankh
in each hand, and
ancient Egyptian
dress. The statue is named
Taweret
,
[3]
the Egyptian god of
fertility
and life.
At the base of the statue is a
secret chamber
in which
Jacob
resides. All
four elements
of earth, water, fire, and air are represented in this chamber. "The fire pit in the middle of the room consisted of flames rising from black sand with a ring of water surrounding all of it."
[3]
The room also housed a weaving loom in which Jacob is shown creating a tapestry. In addition, painted on the ceiling was "an ancient Egyptian astronomical chart which refers to the stars and planets, time, and the goddess Taweret."
[3]
Further ruins are revealed in "
The Brig
" when the Others tie
Locke's father
to the broken base of a large, stone column. Toward the end of the third season, Ben tells Richard to continue leading the rest of the Others to the Temple, and in "
Meet Kevin Johnson
" he sends Alex, Karl, and Rousseau to the same location. His map marks it with a Dharma Initiative symbol, but the Temple has also been mentioned as something the Monster is in place to protect
[
clarification needed
]
. In addition, in "
The Shape of Things to Come
", after Alex is killed, Ben summons the Smoke Monster in a secret chamber hidden in his closet whose stone door contains hieroglyphics. In "
There's No Place Like Home
Pt 3", when Ben enters the Orchid Station, behind the official Dharma built station, he finds what appear to be ancient tombstones covered with unknown hieroglyphs on his way to the final room, where an ancient man-made wheel rests that is used to "move the island". The fifth-season episode "
This Place is Death
" shows a better view of what appears to be the Temple that Ben will one day order Richard to lead his people to. In this episode the temple is directly guarded by the Monster. In "
Whatever Happened, Happened
", Richard Alpert is seen taking a young Benjamin Linus inside the temple, as a means of healing a fatal gunshot wound. Alpert notes beforehand that Ben will emerge a fundamentally different person. It is revealed in "
Dead is Dead
" that the structure the viewers see is merely a wall concealing the temple and the actual temple itself is a mile away on the other side of the wall.
There is also a labyrinth of tunnels beneath the surface of the Island. The lair of the Monster lies in these tunnels, beneath the site of the Temple wall, and another chamber was used by the Others to isolate a
hydrogen bomb
with a breach in its casing, which lies beneath the Dharma Initiative barracks. Some of these tunnels are marked on the blast door map in the Swan Station.
In the sixth-season episode "
Across the Sea
", young
Jacob
and his
unnamed fraternal twin brother
are shown a cave with a waterfall; in "
The End
,"
Desmond
descends into the cave and discovers an ancient chamber.  In the chamber there is a pool of electromagnetic energy with a large hieroglyphic stone that sits at the center covering a mysterious hole. When it is removed by Desmond, the water and energy drain from the pool, an infernal red glow infuses the chamber, and the island begins to violently react. When Jack returns the stone, the water begins to flow into the pool again and the electromagnetic energy returns.
Health-related properties
[
edit
]
The Island has extraordinary healing properties. The Island can heal normally untreatable conditions, such as spinal damage (Locke), cancer (Rose), and infertility (
Jin
). Injuries heal much faster than they normally would, though by no means are people incapable of dying. Disease is also possible, though rare. Since "the Incident", increased electromagnetic immersion caused women who conceive children on the Island to die of an
auto-immune
condition during the second trimester of
pregnancy
. They can otherwise give birth as long as conception occurs off the island or if they leave before the second trimester.
Healing
[
edit
]
Some castaways express the belief that they have been miraculously healed since the crash. Prior to his arrival, Locke was paralyzed, but he regains the use of his legs immediately after the crash.
Richard Alpert
says in "
The Brig
" that Locke's spine healing itself is not a normal event, even by the Island's standards. It is a sign of Locke being somehow "special". The effects of this specialness seem to extend to other people. After his spinal surgery, Ben is paralyzed for over a week, but regains the feeling in his legs immediately after coming into contact with Locke. He is able to walk (with the aid of a cane) only days later.
The Others appear to operate on the assumption that cancer is impossible on the Island ("
One of Us
"). Ben Linus appears deeply shocked when told he has a tumor on his spine, and Juliet notes the coincidence that Jack, a spinal surgeon, arrived on the island two days after Ben's condition was diagnosed. Similarly, Rose had been dying of cancer before crashing on the island. After the crash, she feels as if the cancer has "left her body" and, in "
S.O.S.
", credits her cure to the island. Jack contracts appendicitis while on the Island, which Rose observes is suspicious given that they expect their imminent rescue and the fact that she strongly believes that it is impossible to get sick on the Island.
Locke also makes a miraculously fast recovery in the episode "
Through the Looking Glass
", after being shot and left for dead by Ben in the episode "
The Man Behind the Curtain
". Locke also comments that he would have died from being shot, had the kidney Ben was aiming for not been removed earlier in his life. In the episode "
Lockdown
", his legs are crushed by the Swan station's blast doors. Rose teases Locke later when he is depressed about possibly being immobile, saying that he will recover sooner than he should. In "
Because You Left
", Locke gets shot in the leg by Ethan when he is flashed to the past. After Locke gets flashed to the present day, Richard briefly treats his wound and tells him "the island will do the rest."
Other characters like
Mikhail Bakunin
and Naomi also recover from injuries very fast. Shannon suffers an asthma attack and is in a panic, having lost her inhaler, until Sun recommends herbs from her garden.
In "
The Variable
", Daniel Faraday is shown to have suffered severe mental damage as a result of his experiments in temporal displacement, impairing his long-term memory. Charles Widmore promises Faraday that he will be healed if he goes on the freighter mission he was recruiting him for. Upon his arrival on the island, Daniel is cured of these problems, although he did suffer a temporary relapse after the death of Charlotte.
Pregnancy
[
edit
]
The third season reveals that any woman who conceives on the island dies before the baby is born. Specifically, the pregnancy goes well until about midway through the second trimester, where complications arise. The mother's body rejects the fetus as a viral infection, resulting in both the mother and child's death. Juliet states that in her research, no one made it to their third trimester. Animals such as the wild boars do not die during pregnancy. Women who went through their second trimester off the island are able to give birth without incident (Rousseau, Claire). The Others have enlisted the help of Juliet, a fertility researcher, to help find out why this happens, but she never finds an answer. Several women among the Others volunteer to get pregnant for Juliet's research, all with uniformly fatal results.
In the episode "
LaFleur
" Amy gives birth to a healthy baby Ethan and there was no mention of her being off the island during conception or pregnancy. It is revealed that during Dharma time women would leave the island to give birth, though Amy is clearly in the third trimester of her pregnancy. This implies that the pregnancy problems were caused by the electromagnetism released during the Incident.
In "The New Man In Charge" it is revealed that pregnant polar bears who were transported to the Island from the Hydra station would suffer dire consequences due to the high levels of electromagnetism.
The Island also affects fertility in men. Jin-Soo Kwon was sterile before coming to the Island, but impregnates his wife while there. In the episode "
D.O.C.
", Juliet reveals that men on the island have five times the normal
sperm count
.
"Sickness"
[
edit
]
Contrary to the lack of disease on the Island, Rousseau claims to have killed her team because they had caught a mysterious disease, which necessitated their executions. She also claims that the Others are the carriers of disease. It is later shown that Rousseau's crew was "infected" after entering the tunnels beneath the Temple in order to rescue a member of her team from the Monster. Upon their return, the three crew members show no physical symptoms of anything being wrong with them, but act strangely, even attempting to kill Rousseau. She executed them, believing that they were no longer "themselves" (although she was on the verge of insanity herself after suffering this ordeal). The Temple master, Dogen, refers to both Sayid and Claire as being "infected". This infection is akin to being "claimed" by the Man in Black, and results in a complete loss of emotion and altered personality, a state which both Sayid and Claire were eventually able to overcome.
When Locke is being held captive by Desmond, Desmond asks Locke if any of his people are sick or dying. When Desmond first came to the Island, Kelvin Inman also asked Desmond about his physical health and implied that he was out long enough to have been exposed. A mysterious vaccine is provided by Dharma food drops. It is taken regularly by Kelvin and Desmond in the Swan Station. This vaccine likely exists as a means of enforcing isolation and is of no medical value. It's also highly likely it's for counteracting electromagnetic radiation exposure that's surrounding the Swan Station since 1977.
[
further explanation needed
]
Additional vaccine is administered to Claire's unborn child by Ethan after her kidnapping. During this encounter, Ethan confides in Claire that the Others don't have enough vaccine, implying that either they or their recent abductees required it as well. This vaccine either serves an alternate purpose that Ethan was unwilling to divulge or represents a dramatic misinterpretation of a sickness' true cause.
Other physical properties
[
edit
]
Location
[
edit
]
The Others transmit a signal that they use to locate the Island. The Island is surrounded by a shield of electromagnetic energy, which causes temporal displacement and death when trying to enter or leave the Island, unless the person is traveling from a certain angle and bearing (which changes when the Island moves). The DHARMA Initiative located the Island, after learning about it through the United States Army, by building The Lamp Post, an off-Island station underneath a church, over a pocket of electromagnetic energy that uses the energy and a complex mathematical equation to locate where and when the Island will be. The Island can be physically moved in space, while many of its occupants have been seen to move through time and space, to wherever the island is located at that moment in time. This phenomenon is achieved by tapping into the Island's energy source, as the frozen wheel does.
Electromagnetism
[
edit
]
An
unusual form
of naturally occurring
electromagnetism
is present on the island. While physical objects seem to be affected by the time passage, electromagnetism, such as
radio waves
are not affected. People are able to communicate directly to the outside world without a time lapse. A station was built to study the unique form of electromagnetism found there. Radzinski was very vocal in manipulating electromagnetism "in ways we have never dreamed before". At the end of "
Live Together, Die Alone
", when Desmond has used the fail-safe device in the Swan station to destroy it, a monitoring station in the Antarctic detects the electromagnetic event. It is the same energy as that in the heart of the Island that's been hinted by the Dharma Initiative.
[

]
Jacob's brother tried to use the energy to transport himself off of the Island by building the frozen wheel underground.
Time travel
[
edit
]
The Island is surrounded by an invisible electromagnetic barrier in which the normal rules of time do not apply. In "
The Economist
", a missile fired from a freighter outside the barrier to the Island, carrying a timer in its payload, is shown to take roughly 31 minutes longer to arrive at its designated target area. In the same episode, a helicopter leaves the Island late in the afternoon. Even though the flight only takes about 30 minutes, it arrives at the freighter the next morning.
Doc Ray
's body washes ashore in "
The Shape of Things to Come
", but when the freighter is contacted via radio for an explanation, he is alive and well from their perspective. Two episodes later, in "
Cabin Fever
", the doctor is murdered and thrown overboard.
The barrier poses a threat to those entering or leaving it, particularly if they have been exposed to a high amount of electromagnetism. Doing so under these circumstances can lead to one's consciousness traveling through time (called "temporal displacement" on the show), eventually resulting in death unless a "
constant
" can be found between the present and the destination time period.
After Benjamin Linus turns the frozen wheel beneath the Orchid station, he finds himself in the Tunisian Desert 10 months later. After the wheel is turned, several characters remaining on the Island are intermittently transported back and forward through time, with each shift being accompanied by a blinding purple flash and health deterioration effects (including headaches and nosebleeds) until Locke puts the wheel back on its axis.
Walt's becoming so tall, so quickly was a natural event, and not a result of the temporal displacement, although it was likely the inspiration of this device. Malcolm David Kelley's sudden growth spurt had caused a problem for Abrams and Lindelof who were seeking ways to explain it. In the end, the characters were stuck on the island for 108 days, the same as off the island.
[
clarification needed
]
Temporal displacement
[
edit
]
In the fourth-season episode "
The Constant
", it is revealed that freighter communications officer Minkowski and a crew member named Brandon tried to sneak off the boat to get a closer look at the Island. According to Minkowski, as they approached "something happened" to Brandon that caused them to turn back. Brandon died as a result of this attempt to approach the Island, and Minkowski suffered from temporal displacement (jumping between past and present in his mind) and, lacking a "constant" (some aspect of his life present in both times and to which he would have a strong emotional connection), died soon after.
One crew member, Regina, speaks with Faraday over a radio regarding a rocket payload experiment. At the time, she sounds normal. By the time Sayid and Desmond have reached the freighter, Regina is suffering from some sort of psychosis. She is pretending to be reading a book, even though it is held upside down and she generally appears as "mentally out of it". Later, Regina commits suicide by wrapping herself in heavy chains and jumping into the ocean. No move is made by the crew to dissuade her, with Captain Gault claiming that "she is too far gone." How Regina, having never gotten close to the Island as Minkowski and Brandon had, became ill is never revealed. In "
Cabin Fever
", Captain Gault informs
Martin Keamy
that he may be suffering from some sort of dementia connected with the Island.
Unlike time flashes, during a temporal displacement, time is actually being changed. For example, the events of Desmond's displacement are different from that of the original events before he got to the Island. During the displacement, the person can either have their consciousness from the past in both times, or the present in both times (Desmond's experienced his 1996 consciousness, while Minkowski experienced his present consciousness).

The Man in Black/Smoke Monster
[
edit
]
Main article:
Man in Black (Lost)
The Island is home to a mysterious entity, consisting of a black mass accompanied by mechanical-like sounds and electrical activity within, dubbed the "Smoke Monster" or just the "Monster" by the survivors. The monster has been described by
Lost
producer Damon Lindelof as "one of the biggest secrets" of the mythology.
[4]
The producers have often hinted that the black cloud of smoke is not a monster in the traditional sense, nor is it a cloud of
nanobots
(as some fans have speculated).
[5]
[6]
The smoke monster is established as an antagonist in
Lost
from the very first episode, "
Pilot
".
[7]
The producers' initial plan was for the monster to represent the
id
, in a manner similar to the "
id monster
" from the 1956 film
Forbidden Planet
.
[8]
This idea was changed by the end of
season one
, when the character Danielle Rousseau describes the monster as a "security system" for the Island, specifically the ruins of the temple on the Island.
[8]
[9]
This plan was continued into
season five
, when Rousseau's husband, Robert, describes the monster as a security system that guards the island's temple.
[10]
It has been repeatedly described as a "security system." It emerges from vents in the ground to attack people, though it does not always attack those it encounters. The Monster is capable of lifting a grown man, and in one instance tosses a man nearly fifty feet into the air. In another it wraps a tendril of smoke around a man's arm, severing it.
In the first episode of season 6, "
LA X
", it is revealed that the "Locke", with whom Ben is traveling back to the island, has become The Monster, an incarnation of Jacob's nemesis. It appears in the remains of the statue of Taweret and kills five people. One of the people manages to create a ring of ash around himself, temporarily hindering the smoke monster. The monster throws a rock at the man, knocking him out of the circle and making it possible for it to kill him. After the men are all dead, the smoke monster exits, and Jacob's nemesis, in the form of John Locke, immediately appears, stating that he is sorry that Ben had to see him "like that". It is later revealed that The Monster used to be a man whose only goal has been leaving the Island and "going home".
[11]
[12]
After claiming Sayid to his side, and giving the Others the chance to join him, he stormed the temple and massacred all those who did not comply.
[13]
In "
Recon
", he gave Sawyer a mission to investigate Hydra Island to see if the coast was clear for him and the Others to travel over there so they could take the Ajira plane and fly off the Island. Later in the episode, it tells Kate that he is sorry about Claire. He tells her that his own mother was crazy, just like Aaron's mother, Claire. In the final episode, he is rendered mortal again, along with Jack, the new protector of the island, when the electromagnetic source at the center of the island is disabled. Trapped in the form of John Locke, the Man in Black fights Jack on the cliffs, stabs him and almost kills him. Kate shoots the Man in Black in the back, and Jack kicks him off the cliff, killing the darkness before it could cross over on a boat to Hydra Island in order to escape the Island using the plane.
The Numbers
[
edit
]
The numbers
4
,
8
,
15
,
16
,
23
, and
42
appear throughout the series, both in sequence and individually. The numbers add up to
108
, another common number in the series.
[14]
For example, it is said that the Oceanic Six left the island after 108 days. Also, the button in the hatch had to be pushed every 108 minutes.
The numbers were first explicitly mentioned in the season one episode "
Numbers
", which also happens to be the 18th episode of the series, 18 being the average of the numbers. They were chosen by Lindelof,
J. J. Abrams
and
David Fury
, one of the writers of that episode.
[8]
Speaking in 2008, Fury remarked that "your guesses are as good as mine" as to what the numbers mean.
[8]
They are placed throughout the series for a kind of "Easter egg hunt". Sometimes DHARMA test rabbits can be seen that have identification numbers on them; at least twice, the 23rd rabbit has been seen. They can also be seen on items such as sports shirts and on the DHARMA interrogation room door, which is also designated "23". The plane that brought the castaways to the island for the first time was Oceanic 815. During the season 2 episode "
Man of Science, Man of Faith
", Jack is giving care to two people who have been in a car crash. After one of them dies, a voice is heard in the background saying, "Time of death, 8:15 AM".
According to the DHARMA Orientation video in the
Lost Experience
, the numbers represent the factors of the
Valenzetti Equation
, which claims to accurately predict when humanity will be extinguished. A part of the plot is based on certain characters using the numbers to constitute a code that must be entered in a terminal. The writers originally introduced the numbers solely to engineer a meeting between two characters,
Hurley
and
Rousseau
, not because they had a plan for them. Due to viewer feedback, however, they were eventually implemented into a greater part of the story.
[15]
The numbers are introduced early in season 1: they were
broadcast
from the island's
radio transmitter
as a message that drew
Rousseau
's expedition there. Rousseau changed the message after the deaths of her teammates. The transmission was also heard by military personnel stationed off the island, eventually making their way to
Hurley
.
[
clarification needed
]
Some time before the crash, Hurley uses the numbers for a lottery, and wins a huge amount of money, but this seems to bring those around him nothing but misfortune. Because of this, Hurley believes the numbers are cursed. In the "flash-sideways" in season 6, Hurley has again won the lottery, but with different numbers, and appears to have great fortune afterwards.
In the season five episode "
Some Like It Hoth
", members of the DHARMA Initiative are shown as they are building the hatch which the survivors would later live in. As they are preparing to place the door on the hatch, a worker asks for the serial number to put on the door. Another worker responds by telling him the numbers, which are inscribed on the hatch door. These numbers are later seen by some of the survivors, including Hurley.
The numbers are seen in various occasions in different places during the series. A flashback in season one that shows Jack and Ana meeting at the airport bar mentions their seats on flight 815; Jack sits in row 23 and Ana Lucia in row 42. In season 6 a part of the plot associates each number with a different character, each of them being a "candidate", according to the
Man in Black
, destined to become the new 'protector of the Island' in
Jacob
's place. Jack Shephard was number 23, as in
Psalm 23
, The Lord is my Shepherd (but 42 is associated with Jin Kwon at that point).
When the wreckage is found at the bottom of an ocean trench, the TV reporter announces that there were 324 passengers on the plane, which is three times the sum of the numbers (108 × 3 = 324).
In his last talk to the survivors of the crash, Jacob reveals they are "just numbers".
In an interview with Lostpedia, producer David Fury confirmed that the number 42 was a reference to
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
in which it is “
the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?
".
Lindelof has professed to be a fan of
The Illuminatus! Trilogy
, which details the
23 enigma
, another one of the numbers.
[16]
He also mentioned the movie
The Number 23
and revealed that
Jim Carrey
was the initial choice for the role of
Jack Shepard
before being recast with Fox.
[17]
The number 108 is of great significance in
Hindu
and
Buddhist
mythology.
[18]
At the 2005
San Diego Comic-Con International
, Lindelof stated that "we may never know what the Numbers mean". In a 2010 interview with
USA Today
, Lindelof also remarked that the show “wasn't about the answer to what the numbers meant, it was really about: 'How did I feel while I was watching
Lost
?
'
"
[19]
Character timelines
[

The DHARMA Initiative
[
edit
]
Main article:
Dharma Initiative
From the 1970s to the 1990s, a group known as The DHARMA Initiative operated through numerous stations scattered across the Island, studying its unique properties. They came into conflict with the Others, known to them as the Hostiles, as a result. They formed a tentative truce with them with strict territorial boundaries set for each side.
The DHARMA Initiative began to decline around the 1980s (most likely following the "Incident"), and was virtually destroyed in 1992 when Benjamin Linus facilitated a massacre of the group, named "the Purge", orchestrated by Richard Alpert and the leader of the Others at the time (probably Charles Widmore, who is shown interacting with Benjamin Linus before the Purge, and is generally known for his ruthlessness). Its facilities were left behind, some of which the Others claimed as their own. As a result of time travel, some of the survivors of Flight 815 become directly involved with The DHARMA Initiative, joining the program in the mid-1970s during the height of its power.
The Others
[
edit
]
Main article:
Others (Lost)
The Others are a group of inhabitants that have been on the island for an unknown number of years. It is known that their occupation precedes both the Dharma Initiative and the
U.S. Army
's exploration of the island, as well as the survivors of Flight 815. Early flashbacks show they have been on the island since at least the mid-19th century, and both Jacob and his rival existing on the Island for time preceding even that (definitely hundreds, possibly thousands of years). The Others used to reside in the barracks first built by the Dharma Initiative to house their employees, after the Purge, but have left the Barracks during season 3 and have not returned.
[20]
Oceanic Six
[
edit
]
The
Oceanic Six
is a group that consists of characters who have safely gotten off the
Island
and are given
flashforward
episodes showing them coping with life after a rescue, as opposed to the regular style of
flashbacks
. The characters are revealed in the first seven episodes of
Season 4
:
Jack Shephard
, who was the central character in "Through the Looking Glass", and appeared in two flashforwards in "
The Beginning of the End
"
Kate Austen
, who appeared in the final flashforward of "Through the Looking Glass"
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes
, who was the main character in "The Beginning of the End"
Sayid Jarrah
, who was the central character in "
The Economist
"
Aaron Littleton,
Claire Littleton
's son, born on the island, and raised by Kate as her own son ("
Eggtown
")
Sun-Hwa Kwon
, featured in "
Ji Yeon
" as giving birth to a girl
Show runners
Damon Lindelof
and
Carlton Cuse
revealed the six characters at the
Television Critics Association Summer Press
Tour in July 2008.
[21]
Crossovers
[
edit
]
Prior to their arrival on the Island, both major and minor characters have crossed paths, often unknowingly, sometimes affecting each other's lives. These crossovers are revealed through characters' flashbacks, and are typically obvious only to viewers. Some intersections are quite noticeable, with different characters conversing with each other, but most often the characters are oblivious to these crossovers, which take the form of other characters' appearances on televisions or as glimpses in the background. The crossovers become more frequent in the final episodes of the first season, as all the characters approach each other before arriving at the airport, and finally board the airplane.
In "The Incident" it is revealed that Jacob, the mysterious leader of the Others, has visited the survivors in different periods of time, indicating that his influence may have had a direct connection to those crossovers.
The show's producers have always said that there was a reason characters appeared in each other's flashbacks. Damon Lindelof has stated that these are not "
Easter eggs
", but rather a larger part of the mythology of the series.
[22]
Sensory phenomena
[
edit
]
Whispers
[
edit
]
Whispers can be heard on the Island. They first appear at the end of the episode "
Solitary
",
[23]
and were originally intended to be the sound of the
Others
in the jungle.
[8]
This idea was changed, and, by the end of
season six
, it was established that they were the whispers of spirits of deceased people who had not yet "moved on" (or existed in a state of
purgatory
). Boone's whispers are heard on the Island after his death, talking about Shannon. Some characters to hear the Whispers were Juliet, Jack, Rousseau, Sawyer, Sayid, Hurley, Shannon and Michael on the freighter before he dies.
Visions
[
edit
]
While at first it seems like there are numerous "visions" on
Lost
, most of those involving a person who is supposed to be dead are in fact not visions, but are either the spirit of a dead person, or the Man in Black taking on the physical form and memories of a dead person. Some visions are left unexplained, for instance the horse which appears to both Kate and Sawyer. Visions have helped several characters achieve certain tasks.
[
clarification needed
]
Many spirits have appeared on and off the Island, such as Michael Dawson, Jacob, Emily Linus, Claudia, Ana Lucia, Charlie Pace. Some spirits communicate with the living in their dreams, such as Horace Goodspeed and Boone Carlyle, who each appear to John Locke on separate occasions.
Walt has made appearances on the Island in places he could not have been (most notably to Shannon Rutherford in early episodes of season 2 and to John Locke in season 3); since Jacob's brother is unable to take on the form of the living, and since Walt isn't dead, the origin of this vision is unclear, although it may be related to Walt's special powers, which have been hinted at but never fully explained. Also, while Jacob's spirit was on the Island, Jacob as a child appeared before Hurley and physically took a bag from Hurley's hand, thus showing that he was actually physically present, and not just a spirit.

A Soldier's Story
is a 1984 American
mystery
drama film
[2]
directed and produced by
Norman Jewison
, adapted by
Charles Fuller
from his
Pulitzer Prize
-winning
A Soldier's Play
.  Fuller had said
Herman Melville
's novella
Billy Budd
inspired the play.
[3]
It is a story about racism in a
segregated
regiment of the
U.S Army
commanded by White officers and training in the
Jim Crow South
, in a time and place where a Black officer is unprecedented and bitterly resented by nearly everyone, and follows an African-American
JAG
officer sent to investigate the murder of an African-American sergeant in
Louisiana
near the end of
World War II
.
The cast is led by
Howard E. Rollins Jr.
and
Adolph Caesar
(whose performance was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Other actors include
Art Evans
,
David Alan Grier
,
Larry Riley
,
David Harris
,
Robert Townsend
, Bob Swanson, and
Patti LaBelle
.
Denzel Washington
, still at the beginning of his career, appears in a supporting role. Several actors reprise their roles from the stage version.
The film was first shown at the
Toronto International Film Festival
. It won the New York Drama Critics Award, the
Outer Critics Circle Award
, the Theater Club Award, and three
Village Voice
Obie Awards

Plot
[
edit
]
In 1944 during
World War II
, Vernon Waters, a
master sergeant
in a company of Black soldiers, is shot to death with a
.45 caliber pistol
outside Fort Neal, a segregated
Army
base in
Louisiana
.  Captain Richard Davenport, a Black officer from the
Judge Advocate General's Corps
, is sent to investigate, against the wishes of commanding officer Colonel Nivens. Most assume Waters was killed by the local
Ku Klux Klan
, but others are doubtful.
Nivens gives Davenport three days to conduct his investigation. Even Captain Taylor, the only White officer in favor of a full investigation, is uncooperative and patronizing, fearing a Black officer will have little success. While some Black soldiers are proud to see one of their own wearing captain's bars, others are distrustful and evasive.
Davenport learns that Waters' company was officially part of the 221st Chemical Smoke Generator Battalion.  Though eager to serve their country, they are assigned menial jobs in deference to their white counterparts. Most are former players from the
Negro baseball league
, grouped as a unit to play ball with Waters as manager. Their success against white soldiers gives them a good deal of popularity, with talk of an exhibition game against the
New York Yankees
.
James Wilkie, a fellow sergeant Waters demoted for being drunk on duty, initially describes Waters as a strict disciplinarian, but also a fair, good-natured NCO who got on well with the men, especially the jovial and well-liked C.J. Memphis. Davenport uncovers Waters' true tyrannical nature and his disgust with fellow Black soldiers, particularly those from the rural South.
Private Peterson reveals he stood up to Waters when he berated the men after a winning game. Waters challenged Peterson to a fight and beat him badly. Interviewing other soldiers, Davenport learns that Waters charged C.J. with the murder of a white MP, after a search conducted by Wilkie turned up a recently discharged pistol under C.J.'s bunk. Waters provoked C.J. into striking him, whereupon the weapons charge was dismissed and C.J. was charged with striking a superior officer.
When C.J.'s best friend Corporal Cobb visits him in jail, C.J. is suffering from intense
claustrophobia
and tells Cobb of a visit from Waters, who admitted it was a set-up Waters had done to others. Davenport learns from Cobb that C.J., awaiting trial, hanged himself. In protest, the platoon deliberately lost the season's last game, and Waters was shaken by the suicide. Taylor disbanded the team, and the players were assigned to the 221st.
Davenport learns that white officers Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant Byrd had an altercation with Waters shortly before his death. Both officers admit to assaulting Waters when he confronted them in a drunken tirade, but deny killing him as they had not been issued .45 ammunition. Though Taylor is convinced Wilcox and Byrd are lying, Davenport releases them.
Privates Peterson and Smalls go
AWOL
, and Davenport forces Wilkie to admit he planted the gun under C.J.'s bunk on Waters' orders. Waters had divulged his
internalized racism
to Wilkie, revealing that during World War I, he helped lynch a Black soldier who humiliated them in front of French civilians. Before the lynching victims antics some of the white French women had been willing to go with them on dates.  Davenport asks why Waters did not target Peterson because of their fight, and Wilkie explains that Waters liked and respected Peterson, because Peterson stood up for himself. Davenport has Wilkie arrested just as an impromptu celebration begins, as the platoon is to be shipped out to join the fight overseas.
Realizing Peterson and Smalls were on guard duty the night of Waters' murder, and thus had been issued .45 ammunition for their pistols, Davenport interrogates Smalls, found by the MPs. Smalls confesses Peterson killed Sergeant Waters, as revenge for C.J.'s death. Captured and brought to the interrogation room, Peterson confesses to the murder, saying "I didn't kill much. Some things need getting rid of”, to which Davenport retorts “Who gave you the right to judge who is fit to be a Negro?”
Taylor congratulates Davenport, admitting that he will have to get used to Negroes being in charge. Davenport assures Taylor that he will get used to it - "You can bet your ass on that," he adds, as the platoon marches in preparation for their deployment to the
European theatre
.

Production
[
edit

Jewison and many of the cast members worked for scale or less under a tight budget with
Columbia Pictures
. "No one really wanted to make this movie... a black story, it was based on
World War II
, and those themes were not popular at the box office", according to Jewison.
Warner Bros.
turned it down, as did
Universal
and
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
. Columbia's
Frank Price
read the screenplay and was deeply interested, but the studio was hesitant about its commercial value, so Jewison offered to do the film for a $5 million budget and no salary. When the
Directors Guild of America
insisted he must have a fee, he agreed to take the lowest possible amount. The film ended up grossing $22.1 million.
[6]
Howard E. Rollins, Jr.
had just received an Oscar nomination for his role in
Ragtime
and was cast as the lead. Most of the cast came from
Broadway
careers, but only
Adolph Caesar
,
Denzel Washington
,
Larry Riley
and
William Allen Young
appeared in both the movie and the original off-Broadway play with the
Negro Ensemble Company
in the
New York City
version.
A Soldier's Story
was shot entirely in
Arkansas
. The "Tynin" exterior scenes were shot in three days in
Clarendon
. The baseball sequence was filmed in
Little Rock
at the historic
Lamar Porter Field
.
[7]
Bill Clinton
(then Governor of
Arkansas
) dropped by during the shooting. He became very enthused about the project and later helped by providing the
Arkansas Army National Guard
in full regalia for a grand scene, since Jewison could not afford to pay an army of extras. Production was completed with their help at
Fort Chaffee
United States Army Ready
Reserve
base at
Fort Smith
.
Reception
[
edit
]
The film holds a 92% rating on
Rotten Tomatoes
from a sample of 20 critics. The site's consensus reads, "A meticulously crafted murder mystery with incisive observations about race in America,
A Soldier's Story
benefits from a roundly excellent ensemble and Charles Fuller's politically urgent screenplay".

Plot
[
edit

Lou and Betty Hopke, who own a gas station in California, feel that they owe help to Burt, an ex-Marine who has been confined to a veteran's hospital since the war. Lou is indebted for Burt's having saved his life in combat, and Burt is also Betty's brother.
Whenever it rains, Burt is stricken with terrible memories and panic attacks. Although they want to let Burt live in their home, Lou and Betty worry about his volatile behavior around their two young children.
Stella Murphy has met Burt at a hospital dance and urges him to find a home of his own. She wants him to move to Oregon with her and work on her grandfather's farm, but that region's rainy climate discourages him. Burt decides to invest in the Hopkes' gas station, causing an angry Stella to leave him.
Burt uses his savings to buy a small boat, which he fixes up. Lou and Betty's young son Chris keeps pleading with Burt to take him sailing. The boy stows away when Burt launches the boat, but Burt sends him safely home. Later, the boy sneaks out of his bedroom at the family's home and returns to Burt's boat, docked at a marina. It is dark and it is raining, and Burt is asleep inside the small boat, traumatized by the rain. The boy falls overboard, but his cries of help remind Burt of how he saved Lou's life in another torrential downpour. He rescues the boy, after which everyone is assured that Burt is going to be all right.

Orcas Village
(sometimes just called
Orcas
or
Orcas Landing
) is an
unincorporated community
located at southeastern corner of the West Sound watershed
[1]
on
Orcas Island
in
San Juan County
,
Washington
, United States. It is where the
Washington State Ferry
lands on the island,
[2]
and consequently handles all vehicular traffic to and from the island.
[1]
While the island can also be accessed by
Orcas Island Airport
or by private boats, the ferry connection means that most people enter and leave the island through this small village, which consequently has restaurants, small grocery, and gift shops.
[2]
It is home to the Orcas Hotel—built 1904 and listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
since 1982
[3]
—and also has a small public dock, a private marina, and parking for islanders who commute off-island by ferry. It is designated as an activity center under San Juan County's comprehensive plan.

Le Guignolo
is a 1980 French-Italian comedy film directed by

. The title is Italian prison slang for a "third-rate crook."
[2]
Plot
[
edit
]
The swindler Alexander Dupre (
Jean-Paul Belmondo
) is released from prison ahead of schedule for good behavior, and immediately rushes to make up for lost time during his incarceration. Posing as an Indian prince, he goes on a cruise ship with the jet set, during which he meets with dazzling beauty Pamela George Eagleton (
Mirella D'Angelo
), a rich lady, the wife of a diamond mines owner, who has ended up in a difficult financial situation. As an honorable man the "Prince" could not refuse to offer his assistance to the lady in need and agrees to buy her diamonds. After paying in fake bills, Alexander prepares to remove the stones from the frame and discovers that they are also fakes. "Pamela" turns out to be Sophie - a fraud, exactly like himself. The couple leaves together from the ship. The next victim of their collaboration was to become the Duke of Helmuth von Nassau (
Pierre Vernier
). Sophie was supposed to seduce him, and then Alexander who was to be introduced as her brother, was going to fake a suicide attempt for the reason of bankruptcy. The Duke would simply have to provide financial support for the brother of his beloved. But unexpectedly to Sophie, the Duke proposes to her and writes a check for 500,000, and the criminal plan immediately flies out of her head, and the unfortunate "suicide trier" almost loses his life. Seizing the check from Sophie and wishing all the best for the future spouses, Alexander sends out to implement a different plan. His way is to Venice.
In the plane one of the passengers requests him to carry his bag, given to him by his mistress through customs to avoid explanations to his wife. Alexander agrees to do this favor to him, but upon his arrival witnesses a murder of the owner of the suitcase. It came to light that the victim was a brilliant physicist and mathematician who has developed a new kind of fuel that can replace oil, which has naturally angered the Arab oil tycoons. After unsuccessful attempts to buy the invention, they decided to get rid of the inventor. But the microfilm with the description of the secret technology was in the suitcase given to Alexander unbeknownst to him. The hunt begins for him, and he unsuspectingly under the name of viscount de Valombreza goes to the hotel where he has an appointment with the Japanese, where he intends to sell a fake painting by
Canaletto
.

The second
Rudd government
was the federal executive
Government of Australia
led by Prime Minister
Kevin Rudd
of the
Australian Labor Party
. It commenced on 27 June 2013 and ceased on 18 September 2013.
[1]
Rudd had previously served a
term as Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010
and been replaced by his deputy
Julia Gillard
, following an
internal party spill
. Rudd regained the Labor Party leadership by successfully re-challenging Gillard in a June 2013
party spill
. On 5 August, Rudd called an election for 7 September 2013, which resulted in the defeat of his government by the Liberal/National Coalition led by Opposition Leader
Tony Abbott
.
Background
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Rudd government (2007-10)
and
Gillard government
First Rudd government
[
edit
]
Julia Gillard
with then opposition leader
Kevin Rudd
in 2006. Gillard became prime minister by challenging Kevin Rudd's leadership of the
Australian Labor Party
in 2010. Rudd replaced Gillard in 2013 following another internal leadership ballot.
Kevin Rudd
, born in rural Queensland in 1957, a former diplomat and senior advisor to Queensland Premier
Wayne Goss
, entered the Australian parliament in 1998 as Member for Griffith and was appointed Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister in 2001.
[2]
Rudd teamed successfully with
Julia Gillard
to challenge Opposition Leader
Kim Beazley
and Deputy Leader
Jenny Macklin
respectively for leadership and deputy leadership of the Australian Labor Party and became Leader of the Opposition in 2006.
[3]
Rudd went on to lead Labor to victory at the
2007 federal election
, defeating the incumbent
Coalition
government led by
John Howard
.
[4]
Labor had been in opposition for eleven years,
[2]
and despite an initial period of popularity, Rudd served just two-and-a-half years in office, becoming the first in a line of Australian leaders to be removed by their own party during their first term as prime minister.
[5]
In office, Rudd ratified the
Kyoto Protocol
, offered a Parliamentary apology to indigenous children removed from their parents by the state up to the mid-20th century, and organised the
Australia 2020 Summit
. In economic policy, his government re-regulated the labour market by rescinding the
Howard government
's
Workchoices
reforms and responded to the
Global Financial Crisis
with a large stimulus spending program.
[5]
Rudd also dismantled the three pillars of the Howard government's asylum seeker processing system - offshore processing, temporary protection visas, and turning back unauthorised boats at sea - dubbing them "ineffectual and wasteful".
[6]
By 2010, Rudd's premiership faced difficulties. Following the failure of the government's
insulation program
and amidst controversy regarding the implementation of a
tax on mining
, the failure of the government to secure passage of its Carbon Trading Scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy, significant disaffection had arisen within Labor as to Rudd's leadership style and direction.
[7]
A series of published and private opinion polls indicated that the Rudd government's popularity had declined to a potentially election-losing position.
[8]
[9]
Rudd was challenged by Deputy Prime Minister Gillard to a party leadership ballot, which was held on the morning of 24 June 2010. Rudd did not stand for re-election, and Gillard was elected unopposed as Labor leader and sought her commission to be appointed as Prime Minister, thus ending the first Rudd government.
[10]
The
Gillard government
narrowly survived the
2010 federal election
, forming a
minority government
with the support of four
crossbench
MPs after the election produced a
hung parliament
.
[11]
Gillard government
[
edit
]
Leadership rivalry remained between Rudd and Gillard. Rudd announced his resignation as foreign minister on 22 February, citing a lack of support from Gillard and character attacks launched by
Simon Crean
and "a number of other faceless men" as the catalyst for his resignation.
[12]
Gillard called a leadership ballot for 27 February.
[13]
[14]
She also expanded upon the reasons for her original challenge of Rudd's leadership, saying that his government had entered a period of "paralysis" and that Rudd was operating along "difficult and chaotic work patterns".
[13]
senior ministers launched stinging attacks on Rudd's legacy as Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan lambasted Rudd as "dysfunctional".
[15]
[16]
Gillard portrayed Rudd as a "chaotic" manager and would-be celebrity who led a "paralysed" government.
[17]
Rudd portrayed Gillard as untrustworthy and unable to win an election.
[18]
Rudd nominated Gillard's actions in relation to her promise not to implement a carbon tax; her East Timor and Malaysia Solution plans for asylum seekers; her written agreement with
Andrew Wilkie
on poker reforms and twelve months of low polling as key failings of Gillard's time in office.
[19]
In an emotional address,
Anthony Albanese
announced that he had offered his resignation as Leader of the House of Representatives and would be supporting Rudd because he believed the manner in which he had been replaced in 2010 was wrong. Gillard refused to accept Albanese's resignation.
[20]
Gillard won the ballot by 71 votes to 31.
[21]
Anthony Albanese
supported Rudd's bids to be re-elected as Labor leader. Albanese became Deputy Prime Minister in the second Rudd government.
In March 2013, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals - called "shambolic" by a key crossbencher
[22]
- Chief Whip
Joel Fitzgibbon
confirmed that Labor Party members were "looking at the polls and expressing concerns".
[23]
On 21 March, Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from Cabinet and called a
leadership spill
for 4.30 pm that afternoon.
[24]
Just 10 minutes prior to the scheduled ballot, Rudd announced that he would not stand in the ballot, saying:
[24]
[25]
"
I have said that the only circumstances under which I would consider a return to leadership would be if there was an overwhelming majority of the parliamentary party requesting such a return, drafting me to return and the position was vacant...I am here to inform you that those circumstances do not exist.
"
—
Kevin Rudd
on 14 March 2013, ten minutes prior to the scheduled ballot for the
leadership spill
.
Return of Rudd to leadership
[
edit
]
Amid ongoing poor polling results for Labor, and continuing leadership rivalry, ABC journalist
Barrie Cassidy
triggered renewed leadership speculation on 9 June 2013 by expressing on the
Insiders
television programme a belief that Gillard would not lead Labor into the election.
[26]
On 10 June 2013, one Labor backbencher compared the Labor Party to the
Titanic
.
[27]
ABC News
reported that "some former staunch supporters" held the view that Gillard could not win the election, and on 14 June
Western Sydney
Labor MP
John Murphy
called on Gillard to step down in favour of Rudd;
[28]
On 22 June,
The Age
called upon Gillard to resign for the good of Labor, the nation and the democratic process, "so that vigorous, policy-driven democratic debate can flourish once again".
[29]
On 26 June 2013, with polls predicting a landslide defeat for the Gillard government in the upcoming federal election,
[30]
Gillard announced
another leadership spill
to be held that evening, invited Rudd to challenge and proposed that the loser of the ballot retire from politics at the next election.
[31]
Rudd agreed to this condition and contested the ballot, and was elected leader by 57 votes to 45.
[32]
Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister by Governor-General Dame
Quentin Bryce
on 27 June 2013.
[33]
Seven senior ministers resigned their positions, refusing to serve under Rudd, and Gillard announced her intention not to re-contest her seat at the forthcoming election. Albanese was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, and
Chris Bowen
was appointed Treasurer, replacing
Wayne Swan
.
[34]
Labor initially enjoyed a brief resurgence in opinion polls following Rudd's return to the leadership.
[35]
On 26 July, the Queensland Coroner brought down his report in relation to deaths brought about by the implementation of the first Rudd government's
insulation scheme economic stimulus package
. The coroner found that the deaths of three men were the result of inadequate training for the installation of the roofing insulation, and criticised the Rudd government for rushing through the pink batts program in a bid to stimulate the economy, noting "process failings" by federal agencies that led to "inadequate safeguards".
[36]
The parents of a victim criticised Rudd for never apologising for his role in the scheme.
[37]
Policy
[
edit

Environment
[
edit
]
Greg Combet
, the Gillard government's
Minister for Climate Change
, resigned following the return of Rudd to the leadership, saying that as he had been a strong Gillard supporter, "It is now important that Mr Rudd has a clear opportunity to argue Labor's case and to appoint his own team to take up the fight to Tony Abbott".
[38]
Soon after, he announced an intention to quit politics.
[39]
Mark Butler
became the new Minister for Climate Change.
Carbon pricing

Carbon pricing in Australia
In July 2013, the Rudd government announced its intention to bring forward, to July 2014, the replacement of the Gillard government's controversial
carbon tax
with the proposed
emissions trading scheme
, if re-elected.
[40]
Rudd told
ABC News
in August that the government under his predecessor had "got it wrong" on introducing carbon tax "without mandate", saying: "I don't think our actions on the carbon tax were right. That's why I changed it and moved towards a floating price."
[41]
Rudd pledged prior at the time to "terminate" the "Carbon Tax", stating it would save the average family approximately $380 annually.
[42]
Economy
[
edit
]
Chris Bowen
became Treasurer in the second Rudd government
Wayne Swan had served as Treasurer in the first Rudd government, but resigned the post in view of the acrimonious relationship which had developed between him and Rudd over the intervening period, as did Trade Minister
Craig Emerson
.
[38]
Rudd appointed
Chris Bowen
to serve as
Treasurer of Australia
and retained
Penny Wong
as
Minister for Finance
. Wong also assumed the position of leader of the government in the Senate, following the resignation of Gillard backer
Stephen Conroy
from that post.
Indigenous affairs
[
edit
]
At the commencement of the 2007 election campaign and following John Howard's promise to call a referendum for recognition of indigenous Australians in the
Australian Constitution
, Rudd and Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs
Jenny Macklin
offered "bipartisan support to a commitment for constitutional recognition, regardless of the outcomes of the federal election".
[43]
Two days prior to the election, Rudd told
The Australian
that Labor would not be proceeding with the policy "...in the first term of a Rudd Labor government, if at all".
[44]
In office, the Rudd government did not pursue the issue further. The Gillard government considered, and then shelved the plan.
[45]
Following his return to the prime ministership, Rudd indicated that he had returned to supporting the initiative, in an address marking the 50th anniversary of the
Yirrkala bark petitions
, saying "I want this done in the next term of the Australian Parliament..." but said that the ball for this was in Opposition Leader Abbott's court, who had had to "get his act together". In response, Abbott said that Rudd was politicising the issue, as the opposition had already pledged to put forward a draft constitutional amendment for public consultation within the first 12 months, if elected.
[45]

Asylum seekers

Mandatory detention in Australia
In his second term as Prime Minister, Rudd renounced his opposition to offshore processing of
asylum seekers
in Papua New Guinea and
Nauru
. The flow of asylum seeker boat arrivals to Australia had re-emerged following the first Rudd government's relaxation of border controls. Following an extended period of increasing boat arrivals and deaths at sea, Gillard announced a resumption of offshore processing in August 2012.
[46]
The restored Rudd shifted Labor's policy further, announcing that asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat are not allowed to be settled in Australia.
[47]
Following talks with the
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea
,
Peter O'Neill
, Rudd announced in July 2013 that all asylum seekers arriving to Australia by boat would be sent to Papua New Guinea for processing, to tackle
people smuggling
and refugees that seek asylum without a
visa
. The announcement was made by the Prime Minister, alongside
Tony Burke
and O'Neill. A new Regional Resettlement Arrangement was also signed to implement the policy.
[48]
[49]
Following the announcement, detainees at the processing centre at Nauru rioted.
[50]
On 5 August, Rudd announced that asylum seekers would also be processed and "resettled" on Nauru. The leader of the
Australian Greens
,
Christine Milne
, called the announcement "absurd" on the basis that the island of only 21 square kilometres (8.1 sq mi) produced virtually no food, struggles to provide fresh water and could not absorb more people.
[47]
Social policy
[
edit
]
Marriage
[
edit
]
Five weeks before his final challenge for the Labor leadership, Rudd reversed his previous opposition to extending the definition of marriage under Australian law to include same-sex relationships. Rudd used a blogpost on his website on 20 May 2013 to announce: "I have come to the conclusion that church and state can have different positions and practices on the question of same sex marriage. I believe the secular Australian state should be able to recognise same sex marriage."
[51]
As Prime Minister during the 2013 Election Campaign, Rudd pledged to put a conscience vote on the issue to the Parliament within his first 100 days of office, if re-elected.
[52]
He was the first serving Australian Prime Minister to indicate support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Asked by a New Hope Church pastor on the
ABC TV
program
Q&A
why, "as a Christian", he didn't accept the Biblical notion of marriage, Rudd replied that "Well mate if I was going to have that view, the Bible also says that slavery is a natural condition", and that his change of position on marriage was based on a good, informed Christian conscience.
[53]
[54]
Rudd said that "people don't choose their sexuality" and implied that if the Bible were taken literally, slavery would still be legal.
[54]
The remarks were criticised by the
Glenn Davies
, the
Anglican Archbishop of Sydney
, who said that Rudd had "misquoted the Bible and attributed to the Bible something that Aristotle said... The Bible sees slavery as the result of fallen and broken relationships in society and it is crystal clear in its condemnation of the slave trade...".
[55]
Education
[
edit
]
Former education minister and Gillard supporter
Peter Garrett
resigned from Cabinet following the return of Rudd to the prime ministership, having promised prior to successive ballots that he could not serve under Rudd.
[56]
Bill Shorten
switched his support from Gillard to Rudd in the 2013 leadership spill and was appointed as the new Education Minister, while retaining his Workplace Relations portfolio.
[57]
In July 2013 the Rudd government enacted the $15.2 billion
Better Schools Plan
, devised by the Gillard government in response to the Gonski Report.

Approval ratings of Kevin Rudd in 2013.
On 4 August 2013, Rudd announced that he had asked the Governor-General to dissolve parliament and that an election would take place on 7 September. Kevin Rudd and Opposition Leader
Tony Abbott
met for three debates during the campaign: appearing at the
National Press Club
in Canberra on 11 August, and addressing people's forums at the Broncos Leagues Club in Brisbane on 21 August, and the Rooty Hill RSL Club in Western Sydney on 28 August.
[59]
[60]
[61]
The government criticised the Liberal Opposition's costings of policies. On 30 August, Treasury Secretary Martin Parkinson and Finance Department Secretary David Tune issued a rare public statement challenging the government's claim that Treasury had found a $10 billion hole in the Opposition's policy costings, saying that any modelling used for costing policies submitted by the government before the election could not credibly be applied to opposition policies.
[62]
[63]
On 15 August, Rudd announced a plan to give consideration to creating a special company tax regime and economic zone in the Northern Territory, if re-elected.
[64]
On 27 August, Rudd pledged $52 million towards a High Speed Rail Authority and other steps towards planning the construction of a $114 billion high speed rail project linking Brisbane to Melbourne by 2035.
[65]
On 28 August, Rudd announced a plan to give consideration to possibly relocating the
Garden Island Naval Base
from Sydney to Queensland. The proposal was met with a lukewarm reception, and defence officials did not support the plan.
[66]
[67]
On the evening of the election, Rudd conceded defeat by means of a triumphal speech with a "beaming smile". Rudd spoke to a jubilant crowd for over 20 minutes, said "
Bill Glasson
eat your heart out" (in reference to his local opponent in the seat of Griffith) and declared "I'm proud that despite all the prophets of doom, that we have preserved our federal parliamentary Labor Party as a viable fighting force for the future".
[68]
[69]
Abbott's Liberals and their coalition partner, the Nationals, led by
Warren Truss
, achieved a 3.65 percent
two-party
swing, winning 90 of the seats in the
House of Representatives
to Labor's 55.
[70]
Aftermath
[
edit
]
On the night of the election, Rudd announced that he would remain in Parliament as the Member for Griffith, but not seek to be elected Labor's next leader.
[71]
Outgoing ministers
Craig Emerson
and
Nicola Roxon
called on Rudd to resign from Parliament for the good of the Labor Party, predicting that his ongoing presence would be destabilising. Emerson predicted that Rudd would stand for the leadership again, and said that he had sabotaged Labor's 2010 election campaign with leaks and that "Anyone who does that, who is so hellbent on revenge, who is so destructive as to depress the Labor vote in the 2010 election shouldn't be rewarded for that sort of behaviour".
[71]
In a scathing address in Parliament on 16 October, Roxon said that Rudd's replacement in 2010 had been an "act of political bastardry", but one which was justified because Rudd had been "a bastard himself to so many people".
[72]
Under new leadership election rules instigated during the Second Rudd government, Labor allowed its parliamentary caucus, and - in a new initiative - its general membership to share a 50/50 split of the vote for parliamentary leader. On 13 October
Bill Shorten
was elected to lead the opposition, with 64% of the caucus vote, defeating
Anthony Albanese
who obtained 60% of the general membership vote.
[73]
On 22 November Rudd formally tendered his resignation to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Fake Accounts
is the 2021 debut novel by American author and critic
Lauren Oyler
. It was published on February 2, 2021, by Catapult, and on February 4, 2021, by
Fourth Estate
.
[1]
[2]
The novel follows a young woman who discovers that her boyfriend is behind a popular
Instagram
account which promotes conspiracy theories. It was shortlisted for the 2021
Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction
.
[3]
Plot
[
edit
]
In late 2016 the narrator, a blogger, has feelings of ambivalence towards her boyfriend, Felix. She decides to go through his phone where she discovers a secret
Instagram
account where he espouses conspiracy theories, theories which he does not appear to believe in real life. She decides to break up with him.
The narrator recounts how she met Felix while on a pub crawl in
Berlin
and the two began a long-distance relationship with Felix eventually joining her in
Brooklyn
.
Feeling excited about the prospect of ending her relationship with Felix, she nevertheless decides to delay breaking up with him until after the
2017 Women's March
, which she attends reluctantly. Felix does not text her during the March which angers her. She later receives a call from his mother that reveals Felix was killed while biking.
The narrator decides to quit her job and move to
Berlin
on a whim. Knowing no German (and with no plans to learn) she survives in the English language ex-pat community, taking an under-the-table job babysitting children. Bored, she also begins to aggressively date, making connections through online dating apps and coming up with different personas to try out on the men she is dating.
The narrator eventually receives a call from a former friend that reveals that several hours earlier Felix reappeared at a work event with his former colleagues, revealing he faked his death as a piece of performance art and is now living in
Berlin
. The narrator sends Felix an angry email to which he responds that he assumed she knew he faked his own death.
A short while later the narrator runs into Felix on the streets of Berlin. She mentions that in his new
Instagram
page he quoted something she once tweeted. He tells her that was the point.
Form and style
[
edit
]
A section in the middle of the book is written in a fragmented narrative style popular in contemporary fiction, which the narrator scorns—she asks, "Why, would I want to make my book like Twitter?" Critics were divided on the merit of this parody—some found it effective and comedic,
[4]
[5]
[6]
while others disagreed.
[7]
The narrator of
Fake Accounts
bears obvious resemblances to Oyler, leading several critics to remark on the difficulty of establishing the extent to which the narrator is based on, or parodies, the author.
[8]
[4]
Some critics argued that this was a way for Oyler to push her readers to reflect on the ways they regularly package themselves for consumption—from dating apps to social media, we all engage in reinventions of ourselves.
[9]
Fake Accounts
employs other
metafictional
devices:
[8]
the narrator addresses the reader and an imagined audience of her ex-boyfriends, and the novel is divided into four sections, titled
Beginning
,
Middle (Something Happens)
,
Middle (Nothing Happens)
, and
Climax
.
Writing and development
[
edit
]
Oyler enjoyed the freedom involved in writing a novel. In the past, she had mostly written for articles for magazines, which involved more constraints and editorial intervention.
[10]
She has a reputation for unflinching critiques of novels and books, and she has said she has prepared for a negative review, or negative reviews, of
Fake Accounts
.
[11]
Several interviewers asked her about the possibility around the time the novel was released.
[11]
[10]
Oyler wrote the novel in part due to a desire to comment on the internet and social interactions on the internet.
[12]
Television series
[
edit
]
In February 2022, it was reported that the novel will be adapting into a television series. The project will produced by
Anonymous Content
's AC Studios with
Ben Sinclair
,
Jen Silverman
,
Julia Garner
, Rowan Riley and Oyler as executive producers.
[13]
Critical reception
[
edit
]
Fake Accounts
received generally favourable reviews—though some were ambivalent or negative—with a cumulative "Positive" rating at the
review aggregator
website
Book Marks
, based on 30 book reviews from mainstream literary critics.
[14]
Reviewers frequently described it as funny.
[15]
[16]
[7]
[4]
[17]
[18]
In a review in the
New York Times
,
Katie Kitamura
called it "invigorating" and "deadly precise,"
[18]
and
Kevin Power
, writing in the
Guardian
, said it was "prismatically intelligent."
[15]
Kirkus Reviews
said it was, "Not bad as social commentary. Not that great as a story."
[19]
The
New Statesman
called it "laboured and pretentious," and boring - "an experiment in sustained snark."
[8]
Parul Sehgal
of the
New York Times
said that
Fake Accounts
is a novel in which social media "feels, finally, fully and thoroughly explored, with style and originality." She considered it a worthwhile read, although she warned that it is "maddening at times, too cautious, regrettably intent on replicating the very voice it critiques."
[5]
The
London Review of Books
criticised the novel's tendency towards "aimless" and "half-finished" digressions, but complimented the writing as occasionally "precise, even dazzling."
[6]
Several reviewers lamented the dearth of sincerity and emotional vulnerability in the novel,
[8]
[17]
with
Wired
calling it "bloodless."
[20]
HuffPost
said of
Fake Accounts
that "while successful at capturing the misery of life online, it sometimes feels captured by it."
[20]
A review in the
Rumpus
admitted that the novel's "discomfort with vulnerability, its commitment to self-awareness and self-degradation, ultimately makes for a draining emotional experience," but suggested that this had been Oyler's intention.
[4]
A number of critics noted thematic similarities to
Patricia Lockwood
's debut novel
No One Is Talking About This
, which was published in the same month.
[20]
[16]
[7]
Both deal with the internet and its intrusion into day-to-day life.

The
Battle of Solway Moss
took place on
Solway Moss
near the
River Esk
on the English side of the
Anglo-Scottish border
in November 1542 between English and Scottish forces.
The Scottish King
James V
had refused to break from the
Catholic Church
, as urged by his uncle King
Henry VIII
, who then launched a major raid into south-west Scotland. The Scottish army that marched against them was poorly led and organised, and many Scots were either captured or drowned in the river. News of the defeat is believed to have hastened the early death of James V.
Background
[
edit
]
When Henry VIII of England
broke from the Roman Catholic Church
, he asked James V of Scotland, his nephew, to do the same. James ignored his uncle's request and further insulted him by refusing to meet with Henry at
York
. Furious, Henry VIII sent troops against Scotland. In retaliation for the massive English raid into Scotland, James responded by assigning
Robert, Lord Maxwell
, the Scottish Warden of West March, the task of raising an army.
[3]
[4]
James V wrote to the Pope
Paul III
on 9 November 1542 about the English raid, and explained that he defied Henry VIII's attempts to convert him to the
Protestant faith
by waging war with his vast resources gained from the
dissolution of the monasteries
.
[5]
Battle
[
edit
]
On 24 November 1542, an army of 15,000-18,000 Scots advanced into England. Lord Maxwell, though never officially designated commander of the force, declared he would lead the attack in person. A report of
George Douglas of Pittendreich
, who was not present, and some later
chronicle
accounts, say that in the absence of Maxwell,
Oliver Sinclair
, James V's
favourite
, declared himself to be James's chosen commander. According to this account of the battle, the other commanders refused to accept his command and the command structure disintegrated.
[6]
The English commanders
Lord Wharton
and Sir William Musgrave made reports of the battle. William Musgrave reported that Maxwell was still in charge and fought with the rest of the Scottish nobles, who were forced to dismount on the bank of the
River Esk
.
[7]
The Scots’ advance into England was met near Solway Moss by Lord Wharton and his 3,000 men. The battle was uncoordinated and may be described as a rout. Sir Thomas Wharton described the battle as the overthrow of the Scots between the rivers Esk and
Lyne
. The Scots, after the first encounter of a cavalry chase at "Akeshawsill", now Oakshawhill, moved "down" towards
Arthuret
Howes. They found themselves penned in south of the Esk, on English territory between the river and the Moss (a peat
bog
), and after intense fighting surrendered themselves and their 10 field guns to the English cavalry. Wharton said the Scots were halted at the Sandy Ford by Arthuret mill dam.
[8]
The Scots were 'beguiled by their own guiding', according to one Scottish writer.
[9]
Several hundred of the Scots may have drowned in the marshes and river.
[1]
James, who was not present at the battle (he had remained at
Lochmaben
), withdrew to
Falkland Palace
humiliated and ill with fever. The news that his wife had given birth to a daughter instead of a son further crushed his will to live, and he is reported to have stated that the House of Stewart "came with a lass and will go with a lass". He died at Falkland two weeks later at the age of thirty. According to George Douglas, in his delirium he lamented the capture of his banner and Oliver Sinclair at Solway Moss more than his other losses.
[10]
Aftermath
[
edit
]
Gervase Phillips has estimated that only about seven Englishmen and 20 Scots were killed but 1,200 Scottish prisoners were taken,
[2]
including Sinclair, the Earls of
Cassilis
,
Glencairn
, and
Maxwell
.
[11]
Prisoners taken to England included
Lord Gray
, and Stewart of Rosyth. A number of captured Scottish earls, lords, and lairds were released; they sent hostages, called "pledges" into England in their place.
[12]
On 14 December 1542, Thomas Wharton's report of the battle was read to
Privy Council
, and they ordered that Scottish prisoners entering London should wear a red
St Andrew's cross
. Among the captured guns were four
falconets
with the cast cipher of 'JRS' for 'Jacobus Rex Scotorum' and the Scottish royal arms with an imperial crown.
[13]
Eustace Chapuys
reported that the Scottish prisoners attended Henry's court on Christmas Day wearing swords and dirks. They were able to talk to the French ambassador and Henry gave them each a present of a gold chain. These hostages and prisoners were mostly well treated in England, as it was hoped that when they returned to Scotland after their ransoms were paid, they would further the English cause. Some of the high-ranking prisoners taken at the battle were exchanged for their 'pledges' at
Carlisle
on 10 January 1543.
[14]
Chapuys said the return of some prisoners was prevented at this time by the Scottish government which claimed they were traitors for losing the battle, or suspected they were now being influenced by Henry. As their families were arrested, these prisoners could not provide their pledges and stayed on the border at
Berwick-upon-Tweed
.
[15]
However, a modern historian
Marcus Merriman
sees the battle and hostage-taking more as the culmination of James V's war rather than the beginning of Henry VIII's War of
Rough Wooing
(also known as the Nine Years' War). He notes that the capture of so many Scottish nobles at the time of the birth and accession of
Mary, Queen of Scots
did not affect Henry's policy or the Scottish lords' subsequent rejection of the
Treaty of Greenwich
in December 1543.
[16]
Schedules of prisoners, keepers, and pledges
[
edit
]
The chief Scottish prisoners were taken to
Newcastle upon Tyne
, and were listed with their English keepers at that time in a schedule prepared by Sir Thomas Wharton;
[17]
below the keepers of their substitute 'pledges' or hostages are added from a list compiled later in 1543 amongst the papers of the
Earl of Shrewsbury
.
[18]

Gilbert Kennedy
,
Earl of Cassilis
; keeper Sir Thomas Wharton: pledge with Archbishop of Canterbury.
Lord Maxwell
; keeper Sir Thomas Wharton; remained at Carlisle in person.
William Cuninghame, 4th Earl Glencairn, keeper Duke of Norfolk
In March 1544, as the War of Rough Wooing or Nine Years' War commenced in earnest, Henry VIII sent his
Richmond Herald
,
Gilbert Dethick
, to the Privy Council of Scotland at
Stirling Castle
to demand the return to England of a number of these high-ranking prisoners who had been allowed home on licence. These were: the Earls of Cassilis and  Glencairn, Lords Somerville, Maxwell, Gray, Oliphant, and Fleming, with Oliver Sinclair, George Hume of Ayton, Robert Master of Erskine, William Seton, Patrick Hepburn, James Pringle, James Sinclair, Alexander Sinclair, John Maitland of Awencastle, Henry Maxwell brother of lord Maxwell, John Ross of Craigie, the laird of Moncrieff, John Leslie younger son of the earl of Rothes, and John Carmichael. If the council did not organise their return, Henry threatened revenge on their pledges in England, and penalties on future captives.

HMS
Archer
was one of 20
Acheron
-class
destroyers
built for the
Royal Navy
in the 1910s. She was one of the two
Yarrow
Specials with which the builder was given more freedom in an effort to increase speeds beyond the rest of the class. Completed in 1912 the ship served during the
First World War
and was sold in 1921.
Design and description
[
edit
]
The
Acheron
class was a repeat of the preceding
Acorn
class
, although the
Admiralty
allowed three builders, including Yarrow, more freedom to modify the design of two of their ships apiece in hopes that they might be able to improve upon the speeds previously attained.
[2]
The Yarrow Specials had an
overall length
of 246 feet 2 inches (75 m), a
beam
of 25 feet 8 inches (7.8 m), and a deep
draught
of 8 feet 9 inches (2.7 m). The ships
displaced
775
long tons
(787
t
) at
deep load
and their crew numbered 70 officers and
ratings
.
[3]
Archer
was powered by a single Brown-Curtis
steam turbine
that drove two
propeller shafts
using steam provided by three
Yarrow boilers
. The engines developed a total of 16,000
shaft horsepower
(12,000
kW
) and were designed for a speed of 28
knots
(52 km/h; 32 mph). The ship reached a speed of 30.3 knots (56.1 km/h; 34.9 mph) from 18,537 shp (13,823 kW) during her
sea trials
.
[4]
The
Acheron
s had a range of 1,620
nautical miles
(3,000 km; 1,860 mi) at a cruising speed of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph).
[3]
The primary armament of the ships consisted of a pair of
BL 4-inch (102 mm) Mk VIII guns
in single, unprotected
pivot mounts
fore and aft of the
superstructure
. They were also armed with two single
QF 12-pounder (3-inch (76 mm)) guns
, one on each
broadside
abreast the
bridge
. The destroyers were equipped with a pair of single rotating mounts for
21-inch (533 mm)
torpedo tubes
amidships
and carried two reload torpedoes.

James Burnett, Lord Monboddo
(baptised 25 October 1714; died 26 May 1799) was a Scottish judge, scholar of
linguistic evolution
, philosopher and
deist
. He is most famous today as a founder of modern
comparative
historical linguistics
.
[1]
In 1767 he became a judge in the
Court of Session
.
As such, Burnett adopted an honorary title based on the name of his father's estate and family seat,
Monboddo House
. Monboddo was one of a number of scholars involved at the time in development of early concepts of biological
evolution
. Some credit him with anticipating in principle the idea of
natural selection
that was read by (and acknowledged in the writings of)
Erasmus Darwin
.
Charles Darwin
read the works of his grandfather Erasmus and later developed the ideas into a
scientific theory
.
[2]
[3]

[5]
Early years
[
edit
]
James Burnett was born in 1714 at
Monboddo House
in Kincardineshire, Scotland. After his primary education at the parish school of
Laurencekirk
, he studied at
Marischal College
, Aberdeen, from where he was graduated in 1729. He then studied Civil Law at the
University of Groningen
for three years. He returned to Scotland to stay in Edinburgh in 1736 on the day of the
Porteous Riots
and got caught in the crowds, witnessing the lynching of Captain John Porteous on his first night in the city. He took examination in Civil Law at Edinburgh University in 1737 and was admitted to the
Faculty of Advocates
.
[6]
Burnett married Elizabethe Farquharson and they had two daughters and a son. The younger daughter
Elizabeth Burnett
was an
Edinburgh
celebrity, known for her beauty and amiability, but who died of consumption (
tuberculosis
) at the age of 24. Burnett's friend the Scottish poet
Robert Burns
, had a romantic interest in Elizabeth and wrote a poem, "Elegy on The Late Miss Burnet of Monboddo", praising her beauty, which became her
elegy
.
Monboddo's early work in practising law found him in a landmark piece of litigation of his time, known as the Douglas "cause", or case. The matter involved the inheritance standing of a young heir,
Archibald James Edward Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas
, and took on the form of a mystery novel of the era, with a complex web of events spanning Scotland, France and England. Burnett, as the solicitor for the young Douglas heir, was victorious after years of legal battle and appeals.
Later years
[
edit
]
The grave of Lord Patrick Grant, Greyfriars Kirkyard - containing Lord Monboddo
From 1754 until 1767 Monboddo was one of a number of distinguished proprietors of the
Canongate
Theatre. He clearly enjoyed this endeavour even when some of his fellow judges pointed out that the activity might cast a shadow over his sombre image as jurist. Here he had occasion to further associate with
David Hume
who was a principal actor in one of the plays. He had actually met Hume earlier when Monboddo was a curator of the Advocates Library and David Hume served as keeper of that library for several years while he wrote his history.
From 1769 until 1775
John Hunter
acted as his personal secretary.
[7]
The old
Parliament House
, housing the
Court of Session
In the era after Monboddo was appointed to Justice of the high court, he organised "learned suppers" at his house on 13 St John Street,
[8]
off the
Canongate
in Edinburgh's Old Town, where he discussed and lectured about his theories. Local intellectuals were invited to attend attic repasts.
Henry Home, Lord Kames
was conspicuously absent from such socialising; while Kames and Monboddo served on the high court at the same time and had numerous interactions, they were staunch intellectual rivals.  Monboddo rode to London on horseback each year and visited
Hampton Court
as well as other intellectuals of the era; the King himself was fond of Monboddo's colourful discussions.
[3]
Monboddo died at home 13 St John Street
[9]
in the
Canongate
district of Edinburgh on 26 May 1799 and is buried in
Greyfriars Kirkyard
in Edinburgh along with his daughter Elizabeth where they have unmarked graves in the burial enclosure of
Patrick Grant, Lord Elchies
(within the non-public section known as the Covenanters Prison).

In
The Origin and Progress of Language
, originally published in six volumes from 1774 to 1792, Burnett analysed the structure of languages and argued that humans had evolved language skills in response to changing environments and social structures. Burnett was the first to note that
some languages
create lengthy words for rather simple concepts. He reasoned that in early languages there was an imperative for clarity so redundancy was built in and seemingly unnecessary syllables added. He concluded that this form of language evolved when clear communication might be the determinant of avoiding danger.
Lord Monboddo's inkwell from c. 1760
Monboddo studied languages of peoples colonised by Europeans, including those of the
Carib
,
Eskimo
,
Huron
,
Algonquian
,
Peruvian
(
Quechua
?) and
Tahitian
peoples. He saw the preponderance of polysyllabic words, whereas some of his predecessors had dismissed these languages as a series of monosyllabic grunts. He also observed that in Huron (or Wyandot) the words for very similar objects are astoundingly different. This fact led Monboddo to perceive that these people needed to communicate reliably regarding a more limited number of subjects than in modern civilisations, which led to the polysyllabic and redundant nature of many words. He also came up with the idea that these languages are generally vowel-rich and that correspondingly, languages such as German and English are vowel-starved. According to Burnett, this disparity partially arises from the greater vocabulary of Northern European languages and the decreased need for polysyllabic content.
Monboddo also popularized
Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn
's 17th-century theory of a "Skythian" proto-language, traced the evolution of modern European languages and gave particularly great effort to understanding the ancient
Greek language
, in which he was proficient. He argued that Greek is the most perfect language ever established because of its complex structure and tonality, rendering it capable of expressing a wide gamut of nuances. Monboddo was the first to formulate what is now known as the
single-origin hypothesis
, the theory that all human origin was from a single region of the earth; he reached this conclusion by reasoning from linguistic evolution (Jones, 1789). This theory is evidence of his thinking on the topic of the
evolution
of Man.
Joshua Steele
's disagreement, and subsequent correspondence, with Monboddo over details of the "melody and measure of speech" resulted in Steele's
Prosodia Rationalis
, a foundational work both in
phonetics
and in the analysis of verse rhythm.
Evolutionary theorist
[
edit
]
Monboddo analysed man's relation to other species.
Monboddo is considered by some scholars
[3]
[4]
[5]
[10]
[11]
[12]
as a precursive thinker in the theory of
evolution
. However, some modern evolutionary historians do not give Monboddo an equally high standing in the influence of
history of evolutionary thought
.
[2]
[13]
[14]
"Monboddo: Scottish jurist and pioneer anthropologist who explored the origins of language and society and anticipated principles of Darwinian evolution."
[11]
"With some wavering, he extended
Rousseau
's doctrine of the identity of species of man and the chimp into the hypothesis of common descent of all the
anthropoids
, and suggested by implication a general law of evolution." Lovejoy.
Charles Neaves
, one of Monboddo's successors on the high court of Scotland, believed that proper credit was not given to Monboddo in evolutionary theory development. Neaves wrote in verse:
[15]
Though Darwin now proclaims the law
And spreads it far abroad, O!
The man that first the secret saw
Was honest old Monboddo.
The architect precedence takes
Of him that bears the hod, O!
So up and at them, Land of Cakes,
We'll vindicate Monboddo.
Erasmus Darwin
notes Monboddo's work in his publications (Darwin 1803). Later writers
[5]
[12]
consider Monboddo's analysis as precursive to the theory of Evolution. Whether Charles Darwin read Monboddo is not certain. Monboddo debated with
Buffon
regarding man's relationship to other primates. Charles Darwin did not mention Monboddo,
[16]
but commented on Buffon: "the first author who in modern times has treated [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon". Buffon thought that man was a species unrelated to lower
primates
, but Monboddo rejected Buffon's analysis and argued that the anthropoidal ape must be related to the species of man: he sometimes referred to the anthropoidal ape as the "brother of man". Monboddo suffered a setback, in his standing on evolutionary thought, because he stated at one time that men had caudal appendages (tails); some historians failed to take him very seriously after that remark, even though Monboddo was known to bait his critics with preposterous sayings.
Bailey's
The Holly and the Horn
[4]
states that "Charles Darwin was to some degree influenced by the theories of Monboddo, who deserves the title of Evolutionist more than that of Eccentric." Henderson says:
"He [Monboddo] was a minor celebrity in Edinburgh because he was considered to be very eccentric. But he actually came up with the idea that men may have evolved instead of being created by God. His views were dismissed because people thought he was mad, and in those days it was a very controversial view to hold. But he felt it was a logical possibility and it caused him a great deal of consternation. He actually did not want to believe the theory because he was a very religious person."
[17]
Monboddo may be the first person to associate language skills evolving from
primates
and continuing to evolve in early humans (Monboddo, 1773). He wrote about how the language capability has altered over time in the form not only of skills but physical form of the sound producing organs (mouth, vocal cords, tongue, throat), suggesting he had formed the concept of evolutionary adaptive change.

Hugo Arnot
and Lord Monboddo, by

He also elaborates on the advantages created by the adaptive change of primates to their environment and even to the evolving complexity of primate social structures.  In 1772 in a letter to James Harris, Monboddo articulated that his theory of language evolution (Harris 1772) was simply a part of the manner that man had advanced from the lower animals, a clear precedent of evolutionary thought. Furthermore, he established a detailed theory of how man adaptively acquired language to cope better with his environment and social needs. He argued that the development of language was linked to a procession of events: first developing use of tools, then social structures and finally language. This concept was quite striking for his era, because it departed from the classical religious thinking that man was created instantaneously and language revealed by God. In fact, Monboddo was deeply religious and pointed out that the creation events were probably simply allegories and did not dispute that the universe was created by God. Monboddo was a vigorous opponent of other scientific thinking that philosophically questioned the role of God (see Monboddo's prolific diatribes on Newton's theories).
As an agriculturist and horse-breeder, Monboddo was quite aware of the significance of selective breeding and even transferred this
breeding
theory to communications he had with
James Boswell
in Boswell's selection of a mate. Monboddo has stated in his own works that degenerative qualities can be inherited by successive generations and that by selective choice of mates, creatures can improve the next generation in a biological sense. This suggests that Monboddo understood the role of natural processes in evolution;
artificial selection
was the starting-point for many of the proto-evolutionary thinkers, and for Darwin himself.
Monboddo struggled with how to "get man from an animal"
[5]
without divine intervention. This is typical of the kind of thinking which is called
deist
. He developed an entire theory of language evolution around the Egyptian civilisation to assist in his understanding of how man descended from animals, since he explained the flowering of language upon the spinoff of the Egyptians imparting language skills to other cultures. Monboddo cast early humans as wild, solitary,
herbivorous
quadrupeds
. He believed that contemporary people suffered many diseases because they were removed from the environmental state of being unclothed and exposed to extreme swings in
climate
.
Burnett wrote of numerous cultures (mostly based upon accounts of explorers); for example, he described  "insensibles" and "wood eaters" in
Of the Origin and Progress of Language
.  He was fascinated by the nature of these peoples' language development and also how they fit into the evolutionary scheme.
Against all this, Monboddo's contribution to evolution is today regarded by historians of evolution as being notable.
Bowler acknowledges his argument that apes might represent the earliest form of humanity (Monboddo 1774), but continues:
"He [Monboddo] regarded humans (including savages and apes) as quite distinct from the rest of the animal kingdom. The first suggestion that the human species was descended via the apes from the lower animals did not come until
Lamarck
's
Philosophie Zoologique
of 1809."
[2]
Charles Dickens
knew of Monboddo and wrote in his novel,
Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit
about
"(...) the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys"
.
[18]
This is significant because
Martin Chuzzlewit
was published decades before Darwin wrote his theory of evolution.
[19]
The
history of the theory of evolution
is a relatively modern field of scholarship.
Metaphysics
[
edit
]
In
Antient Metaphysics
, Burnett claimed that man is gradually elevating himself from the animal condition to a state in which mind acts independently of the body. He was a strong supporter of Aristotle in his concepts of Prime Mover. Much effort was devoted to crediting
Isaac Newton
with brilliant discoveries in the Laws of Motion, while defending the power of the mind as outlined by Aristotle. His analysis was further complicated by his recurring need to assure that Newton did not obviate the presence of God.
Nudism
[
edit
]
Monboddo was a pioneer in regard to many modern ideas and had already in the eighteenth century realized the value of "air-baths"
[20]
(the familiar term which he invented) to mental and physical health. In his writings Monboddo argued against clothes as unnatural and undesirable from every point of view for both mind and body. Monboddo "awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room
naked
, with the window open, which he called taking an air bath." When
nudism
was first brought into fashion with much enthusiasm in Germany as
Freikörperkultur
early in the twentieth century Monboddo was regarded as a pioneer, and in 1913 a
Monboddo Bund
was established in Berlin,
[21]
for the harmonious culture of body and mind.
[22]
[23]
Eccentricity
[
edit
]
Burnett was widely known to be an eccentric.  Habitually he rode on horseback between
Edinburgh
and London instead of journeying by
carriage
. Another time after a decision went against him regarding the value of a horse, he refused to sit with the other judges and assumed a seat below the bench with the court clerks. When Burnett was visiting the
Court of King's Bench
in London in 1787, part of the floor of the
courtroom
started to collapse. People rushed out of the building but Burnett who, at the age of 71, was partially deaf and shortsighted, was the only one not to move. When he was later asked for a reason, he stated that he thought it was "an annual ceremony, with which, as an alien, he had nothing to do".
Burnett in his earlier years suggested that the
orangutan
was a form of man, although some analysts think that some of his presentation was designed to entice his critics into debate.
Lord Monboddo, a caricature by
John Kay
The orangutan was at this time a generic term for all types of apes. The Swedish explorer whose evidence Burnett accepted was a naval officer who had viewed a group of monkeys and thought they were human. Burnett may simply have taken the view that it was reasonable for people to assume the things they do and the word of a naval officer trained to give accurate reports was a credible source. Burnett was indeed responsible for changing the classical definition of man as a creature of reason to a creature capable of achieving reason, although he viewed this process as one slow and difficult to achieve.
At one time he said that humans must have all been born with tails, which were removed by midwives at birth. His contemporaries ridiculed his views, and by 1773 he had retracted this opinion (Pringle 1773). Some later commentators have seen him as anticipating
evolutionary
theory. He appeared to argue that animal
species
adapted and changed to survive, and his observations on the progression of primates to man amounted to some kind of concept of
evolution
. Burnett also examined
feral children
and was the only thinker of his day to accept them as human rather than monsters. He viewed in these children the ability to achieve reason. He identified the orangutan as human, as his sources indicated it was capable of experiencing shame.
In popular culture
[
edit
]
In
Thomas Love Peacock
's 1817 novel
Melincourt
, an orangutan punningly named "Sir Oran Haut-Ton" becomes a candidate for British Parliament based on Monboddo's theories.
Charles Dickens
, in his novel
Martin Chuzzlewit
,
[18]
refers to "the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys".
In his 1981
dystopian
novel
Lanark
,
Alasdair Gray
names the head of the mysterious Institute Lord Monboddo. He makes the connection explicit in a marginal note, adding that it is not a literal depiction.
Lord Monboddo's descendant, Jamie Burnett of Leys, has sponsored a stage work
Monboddo - The Musical
which is a biographical re-enactment of the life of his ancestor. It received a first run at Aberdeen Arts Centre in September 2010.
In her short story "The Monboddo Ape Boy",
Lillian de la Torre
depicted a slightly fictionalised Monboddo meeting
Samuel Johnson
, and being presented with a supposed "wild boy".

History
[
edit
]
In the place was the Roman castle
Aliso
, abandoned some time after the
Battle of the Teutoburg Forest
. Nowadays the
LWL-Römermuseum Haltern am See
informs about the Roman living here.
Former
Halteren
was founded on February 3 in 1289. They received the town charter by the prince-bishop of
Münster
, Everhard von Dienstag.
During
Kristallnacht
(1938), the town's synagogue, Jewish cemetery and the houses and shops belonging to the town's Jews were vandalised. Jews were deported to concentration camps, the last five of whom were deported in January 1942.
[4]
Only one of the town's Jews survived the
Holocaust
:
Alexander Lebenstein
, after whom a school is named.
In March 2015, the town received international attention when 16 students and two teachers from the
Joseph-König-Gymnasium
in Haltern, were killed in the
Germanwings Flight 9525
crash in the French Alps. They were on their way home from a student exchange with the Giola Institute in
Llinars del Vallès
,
Catalonia
,
Spain
.
[5]
Haltern's then mayor,
Bodo Klimpel
, described it as "the darkest day in the history of our city."

Charles McHugh
(1856 − 12 February 1926) was an Irish
Roman Catholic
prelate and was
Bishop of Derry
for nineteen years from 1907-1926.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
He was born in the parish of Aghyaran in West Tyrone in 1856, son of Francis and Catherine McHugh.
[1]
He was educated locally before proceeding to
St Patrick's College, Maynooth
and was ordained to the priesthood in
St Eugene's Cathedral
in June 1881.
[2]
His first pastoral appointment was to the staff of
St Columb's College
Derry and after some years with failing health he asked for a curacy.  After recuperation he was appointed President of the college in 1890 and spent 15 years in that role until he was made Parish Priest of
Strabane
in 1905.
[3]
Bishop of Derry
[
edit
]
At the time of his appointment as bishop the
Irish Times
reported him to be "a prelate of thought, ripe scholarship and invariable courtesy."
[4]
He received episcopal consecration on 29 September 1907 and for much of his episcopal ministry the social and political backdrop was the rising
Home Rule
crisis and then more latterly, the
Partition of Ireland
which divided his diocese into two separate states. McHugh was an active supporter of
John Redmond
up to the start of the First World War.
[5]
In July 1916 Bishop McHugh established the Anti-Partition League to campaign against the threat of the
Partition of Ireland
.
[6]
McHugh died in office on 12 Feb 1926.

C. G. Jung-Institut Zürich in Küsnacht
The
C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich
(
German
:
C. G. Jung-Institut Zürich
[1]
) was founded in
Küsnacht
,
Switzerland
in 1948 by the psychiatrist
Carl Gustav Jung
, the founder of
analytical psychology
(more commonly called Jungian psychology).
Marie-Louise von Franz
and
Jolande Jacobi
were also active in the foundation and early work of the institute.
The institute was founded in 1948
[2]
to provide training and conduct research in analytical psychology and
psychotherapy
. Jung led the institute until 1961, the year of his death. The library of the institute holds around 15,000 books and periodicals related to
Jungian psychology
.
Several other organizations named the C.G. Jung Institute exist around the world, e.g. in

The
1963 Sandlapper 200
was the site of
Richard Petty
's 25th
NASCAR
Grand National
win for
Petty Enterprises
(now
Richard Petty Motorsports
).
Taking place on August 8, 1963, at
Columbia Speedway
in
Columbia, South Carolina
.
[2]
Two hundred laps were done on a
dirt track
spanning 0.500 miles (0.805 km). The transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade.  Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the "strictly stock" vehicles of the 1950s.
Background
[
edit
]
Columbia Speedway
was an oval racetrack located in
Cayce
, a suburb of
Columbia, South Carolina
. It was the site of
auto races
for
NASCAR
's top series from 1951 through 1971.
[3]
For most of its history, the racing surface was dirt.  The races in April and August 1970 were two of the final three
Grand National
races ever held on a dirt track.
[4]
The track was paved before hosting its last two Grand National races in 1971.
While Columbia Speedway was shut down to cars in 1979, noise complaints, it reopened as a velodrome in 2001.
Race report
[
edit
]
This race was the last time that the letter "X" could be legally used as a race number. An amendment to one of NASCAR's rules made by
Bill France, Sr.
forced all drivers to use only single-digit and double-digit race car numbers started in the
1963 Western North Carolina 500
event. As a result, cars could no longer use letters and/or numbers higher than "99" at any NASCAR Cup Series racing event.
It took one hour, forty-seven minutes, and fifty-five seconds for Richard Petty to defeat
David Pearson
with a margin of nine seconds.
[2]
Pearson and Petty would start a bitter rivalry during the course of the race that would ultimately influence all future rivalries in the NASCAR Cup Series.
[5]
The notable speeds were: 55.598 miles per hour (89.476 km/h) as the average speed and 69.014 miles per hour (111.067 km/h) as the pole position speed.
[2]
8,500 people attended this untelevised race.
[2]
Other notable participants included:
J.D. McDuffie
,
Wendell Scott
,
Cale Yarborough
and
Buck Baker
.
[2]
Possum Jones
scored last place in the race after only finishing five laps due to tire issues.
[2]
Frank Warren
finished the race 13th in his unsponsored 1961
Pontiac Catalina
vehicle (with the X designation for his driver number) after starting in 18th place. He received $100 ($956 when considering inflation) as a part of his winnings.
[2]
Total winnings for this race were $4,825 ($46,121 when considering inflation) with Petty receiving most of it with $1,140 ($10,897 when considering inflation).
[2]
Billy Oswald would retire from professional stock car racing after the completion of this event.
[6]
Ray Fox
,
Herman Beam
and
Crawford Clements
were the most notable crew chiefs that participated in the race.
[7]
This was the first of more than 60 "first-place/second-place" finishes for NASCAR's two most prolific winners Richard Petty and David Pearson. Both Petty and Pearson were considered to be equals to each other in the 1960s because of their similar methodology of professional stock car racing.

In
mathematics
, the
icosians
are a specific set of Hamiltonian
quaternions
with the same symmetry as the
600-cell
. The term can be used to refer to two related, but distinct, concepts:
The
icosian
group
: a
multiplicative group
of 120 quaternions, positioned at the vertices of a 600-cell of unit radius. This group is
isomorphic
to the
binary icosahedral group
of
order
120.
The
icosian
ring
: all finite sums of the 120 unit icosians.
Unit icosians
[
edit
]
The 120 unit icosians, which form the icosian group, are all
even permutations
of:
8 icosians of the form ½(±2, 0, 0, 0)
16 icosians of the form ½(±1, ±1, ±1, ±1)
96 icosians of the form ½(0, ±1, ±1
/φ
, ±
φ
)
In this case, the vector (
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
) refers to the quaternion
a
+
b
i
+
c
j
+
d
k
, and φ represents the
golden ratio
(
√
5
+ 1)/2. These 120 vectors form the
H4 root system
, with a
Weyl group
of order 14400. In addition to the 120 unit icosians forming the vertices of a 600-cell, the 600 icosians of norm 2 form the vertices of a
120-cell
. Other
subgroups
of icosians correspond to the
tesseract
,
16-cell
and
24-cell
.
Icosian ring
[
edit
]
The icosians lie in the
golden field
, (
a
+
b
√
5
) + (
c
+
d
√
5
)
i
+ (
e
+
f
√
5
)
j
+ (
g
+
h
√
5
)
k
, where the eight variables are
rational numbers
. This quaternion is only an icosian if the vector (
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
,
f
,
g
,
h
) is a point on a lattice
L
, which is isomorphic to an
E8 lattice
.
More precisely, the quaternion norm of the above element is (
a
+
b
√
5
)
2
+ (
c
+
d
√
5
)
2
+ (
e
+
f
√
5
)
2
+ (
g
+
h
√
5
)
2
.  Its Euclidean norm is defined as
u
+
v
if the quaternion norm is
u
+
v
√
5
.  This Euclidean norm defines a
quadratic form
on
L
, under which the lattice is isomorphic to the
E8 lattice
.
This construction shows that the
Coxeter group
H
4
{\displaystyle H_{4}}
embeds as a subgroup of
E
8
{\displaystyle E_{8}}
.  Indeed, a linear isomorphism that preserves the quaternion norm also preserves the Euclidean norm.

was originally a log cabin built by Jabez Owen c. 1806, and later expanded with wood framing by Thomas Perkins Primm c. 1845.
[3]
This property in
Brentwood, Tennessee
was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
in 1988.
Dr. Jabez Owen was a prominent physician and planter in Brentwood who owned hundreds of acres around Moores Lane, Wilson Pike, and Concord Road. Dr. Owen was one of the wealthiest men in Williamson County, and at his death in 1850 he owned 58 slaves.
[4]
Some of these antebellum slave cabins still stand on the property today.

The
Ottawa Senators
were an
ice hockey
team based in
Ottawa
, which existed from 1883
[1]
to 1954. The club was the first hockey club in Ontario,
[5]
a founding member of the
National Hockey League
(NHL) and played in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. The club, which was officially the
Ottawa Hockey Club
(Ottawa HC), was known by several nicknames, including the
Generals
in the 1890s, the
Silver Seven
from 1903 to 1907 and the
Senators
dating from 1908.
[6]
Generally acknowledged by hockey historians as one of the greatest teams of the early days of the sport, the club won numerous championships, starting with the 1891 to 1893 Ontario championships. Ottawa HC played in the first season during which the
Stanley Cup
was challenged in 1893, and first won the Cup in 1903, holding the championship until 1906 (the
Silver Seven
years). The club repeated its success in the 1920s, winning the Stanley Cup in 1920, 1921, 1923 and 1927 (the
Super Six
years). In total, the club won the Stanley Cup 11 times, including challenges during two years it did not win the Cup for the season. In 1950, Canadian sports editors selected the Ottawa HC/Senators as Canada's greatest team in the first half of the 20th century.
[7]
[8]
The club was one of the first organized clubs in the early days of the sport of ice hockey, playing in the
Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments
in the early 1880s and founding the
Amateur Hockey Association of Canada
and the
Ontario Hockey Association
. Along with the rise of professionalism in ice hockey in the first decade of the 1900s, the club changed to a professional team and were founding members of the
National Hockey Association
(NHA) and its successor, the National Hockey League. The club competed in the NHL until the
1933-34 season
. Due to financial difficulties, the NHL franchise relocated to
St. Louis, Missouri
, to become the
St. Louis Eagles
. The organization continued the Senators as an amateur, and later semi-professional, team in Quebec
senior
men's leagues until 1954. The "
Senior Senators
" would win three
Allan Cup
titles.

The Ottawa Hockey Club (Ottawa HC) was founded by a small group of like-minded hockey enthusiasts. A month after witnessing games of hockey at the
1883 Montreal Winter Carnival
,
Halder Kirby
,
Jack Kerr
and
Frank Jenkins
met and founded the club.
[9]
Being the first organized ice hockey club in Ottawa, and also the first in
Ontario
, the club had no other clubs to play that season. The only activities that winter were practices at the "Royal Rink" starting on March 5, 1883.
[10]
The club first participated competitively at the
1884 Montreal Winter Carnival
ice hockey tournament (considered the Canadian championship at the time)
[11]
wearing red and black uniforms. Future Ottawa mayor
Nelson Porter
is recorded as the scorer of the club's first-ever goal, at the 1884 Carnival.
[1]
Frank Jenkins was the first captain of the team; he later became the president of the hockey club in 1891 and of the
Amateur Hockey Association of Canada
(AHA or AHAC) in 1892.
[9]
Ottawa Hockey Club, 1885
For the 1885 season, the club adopted gold and blue as its colours
[12]
and returned to the Montreal tournament. Ottawa earned its first-ever victory at the tournament over the
Montreal Victorias
, but lost its final match to the
Montreal Hockey Club
(Montreal HC) to place second in the tournament. The 1886 Montreal tournament was cancelled due to an outbreak of
smallpox
and the club would not play an outside match again until 1887.
Formation of the AHAC
[
edit
]
On December 8, 1886, the first championship league, the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada was founded in Montreal.
[13]
It was composed of several clubs from Montreal plus a Quebec City club and the Ottawa club. Ottawa's
Thomas D. Green
was named the first president of the league.
[13]
The league did not have a set schedule, and instead games were played in "challenge series", whereby a team held the championship and entertained challengers until the end of the season, a format the league employed until 1893. Under the format, Ottawa lost the one challenge it played in that first
1887 season
to the Montreal Victorias.
After that season, Ottawa HC became inactive. The Royal Rink, which had been their primary facility, had been converted to a
roller skating
rink, and ice rink facilities were at a shortage. This changed with the opening of the
Rideau Skating Rink
in February 1889. One of the principal organizers in the restarting of the team was
Ottawa Journal
publisher
P. D. Ross
, who also played on the team. Returning as captain was Frank Jenkins, and the other players were Halder Kirby, Jack Kerr, Nelson Porter, Ross, George Young,
Weldy Young
, Thomas D. Green, William O'Dell, Tom Gallagher,
Albert Low
and Henry Ami.
[14]
In 1889, the club played only one match against an outside club, an exhibition at the Rideau rink against the Montreal HC 'second' team.
[15]
In November 1889, the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club (OAAC) was opened at the corner of today's
Elgin
and
Laurier
Streets on the site of today's
Lord Elgin Hotel
. The Club building would also be the Hockey Club's headquarters. The OAAC was affiliated with the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association (OAAA), and the Hockey Club through the affiliation also became OAAA members. When the club began outside competition again in 1889-90, it was with new sweaters of white with black stripes and the OAAA red "triskelion" logo.
[16]
It was during this period of affiliation with the OAAC, that the club would become known by the nickname "Generals", attributed to the club's insignia.
[17]
The club is also referred to as the "Capitals" in literature, although there was a rival
Ottawa Capitals
club organized by the Capital Amateur Athletics Association active at the time.

In the
1889-90 season
, Ottawa HC played two competitive games but this was to increase greatly the next season. The
1890-91 season
saw the club play 14 games, playing in three leagues. Ottawa HC was a founding member of two new leagues, the
Ottawa City Hockey League
(OCHL) and the
Ontario Hockey Association
(OHA) and also rejoined the AHAC. Ottawa HC won the Ottawa and Ontario championships, and two games against AHAC opponents, but lost to the AHAC champion Montreal HC in its one challenge for the championship.
[19]
OHA championships
[
edit
]
The team was the OHA champion for that league's first three years. The
first championship
was played on March 7, 1891, at the Rideau rink and was won 5-0 by Ottawa over Toronto St. George's.
[20]
The 1891 championship was the only OHA final played in Ottawa, as Ottawa played the 1892 final in Toronto, defeating
Osgoode Hall
4-2, and in 1893 the
Toronto Granites
defaulted by not appearing for the championship match scheduled for Ottawa. The club resigned from the OHA in February 1894 after the OHA refused the club's demand to have the 1894 final in Ottawa and ordered Ottawa HC to play the final in Toronto.
[21]
The dispute caused a permanent schism between Ottawa area teams competing in the Ottawa City Hockey League (OCHL) and the Ontario Hockey Association. Ottawa and area teams remain unaffiliated with the OHA; the official association under
Hockey Canada
is
Hockey Eastern Ontario
, a descendant of the OCHL.
It was at a dinner to honour the
1892 OHA champions
at the Russell Hotel that the Governor General,
Lord Stanley
, announced his new Dominion Challenge Trophy, now known as the
Stanley Cup
, for the Canadian champions.

Re-entry into the AHAC
[
edit
]
Ottawa HC did not win a game in its return to AHAC challenge play in
1890-91
, but in the next season of AHAC play in
1891-92
the club won the league championship, and held it for most of the season, from January 10 until March 7, 1892. The club took the championship from Montreal HC, who were previously undefeated, and won five straight games before Montreal won the championship back by a 1-0 score in the last challenge of the season. Montreal's win in the final challenge was their only win of the season and their only one in four games against Ottawa.
Lord Stanley, who often attended Ottawa HC games, felt the loss of the title after holding it all season was an unsuitable way to determine the championship. In the letter announcing the Stanley Cup, Stanley suggested that the AHAC start a 'round-robin' type regular season format, which the AHAC implemented in the following season of
1892-93
.
[25]
The key match-up in that season for Ottawa was a loss in the opening game of the season against the Montreal Victorias on January 7, 1893, as Ottawa split its season series with eventual winner Montreal HC, both teams otherwise winning all of their games. This loss provided the one game margin in the standings that led to Lord Stanley awarding the initial Cup to Montreal HC.
[26]
In
1893-1894
, Ottawa HC finished in a four-way tie for first in the AHAC standings. A playoff was arranged in Montreal for the championship between Ottawa, Montreal HC and Montreal Victorias (the other first place club, Quebec, having dropped out of the playoff). These games would be the first Stanley Cup playoff games ever played. As the 'away' team, Ottawa was given a bye to the final game.
[27]
On March 23, 1894, at the
Victoria Rink
, Ottawa and Montreal HC played for the championship. Ottawa scored the first goal, but Montreal would score the next three to win the game 3-1. Ottawa captain Weldy Young fainted from exhaustion at the end of the game.
[28]
The 1901 club, CAHL (left trophy) and Ottawa (right shield) champions.
The club wore the same 'O' logo as the Ottawa Football Club that season.
For the period of 1894 to 1900, the club did not win the league championship, finishing as high as second several times, and fifth (last) once.
[29]
For the 1896-97 season, the Ottawa club unveiled the first use of the 'barber-pole' style sweaters of horizontal bars of black, red and white. This basic style would be used by the club until 1954 except for the 1900 and 1901 seasons, when the team used a plain sweater with only the letter 'O' on the front, identical in design to the sweaters of the
Ottawa Football Club
, also an OAAA affiliate.
In 1898, the AHAC dissolved over the admission of the intermediate-level team Ottawa Capitals of the rival Capital Amateur Association to the AHAC by a vote of the league executive. The Capitals had won the intermediate championship of the AHAC and were eligible to join the senior ranks. After they were outvoted by the intermediate-level teams of AHAC which wanted to promote the Capitals to the senior-level, the senior-level Ottawa, Montreal HC, Montreal Victorias and Quebec clubs left the AHAC and formed the
Canadian Amateur Hockey League
(CAHL), shutting out the Capitals.
[30]
The club won the CAHL
1901 season
title, its first league championship since winning the OHA in 1893. It wished to challenge the Stanley Cup champion
Winnipeg Victorias
at first but chose not to after deliberating for a week after the season, although it also had the option to challenge in the 1902 season.
[31]
According to hockey historian Charles L. Coleman, it was due to the "lateness of the season".
[32]
The Ottawa Journal
openly supported the idea, stating that the players were 'racked' and would be at a serious disadvantage to travel to Winnipeg.
[33]
Notable players of this period included Albert Morel and Fred Chittick in goal, leaders of the league several times in goaltending, and future Hall of Famers
Harvey Pulford
,
Alf Smith
,
Harry Westwick
and brothers
Bruce Stuart
and
Hod Stuart
. It was during this period that the nickname
Senators
was first used; however, from 1903 to 1906, the team is better known as the
Silver Seven.
Silver Seven era (1903-1906)
[

]
Group picture of the 1905 Ottawa "Silver Seven", Stanley Cup champions
The first "dynasty" of the Ottawa HC was from 1903 until 1906, when the team was known as the "Silver Seven".
[34]
The era started with the arrival of
Frank McGee
for the 1903 season and ended with his retirement after the 1906 season. Having lost an eye in local amateur hockey, he was persuaded, despite the threat of permanent blindness, to join the Senators. The youngest player on the team and standing 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall, he went on to score 135 goals in 45 games. In a 1905 challenge against the
Dawson City
, he scored 14 goals in a 23-2 win. He retired in 1906 at the age of 23.
[35]
In the
1903 CAHL season
, Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both finished in first place with 6-2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias'
Russell Bowie
, who scored seven goals in one game and six in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1-1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by 3,000 fans, was on ice coated with an inch of water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8-0, with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup.
[36]
This started a period in which the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March 1906.
For that Stanley Cup win, each of the team's players was given a silver nugget by team executive
Bob Shillington
, an Ottawa druggist and mining investor. He gave them nuggets instead of money since the players were still technically amateurs and to give them money would have meant disqualification from the league. In a 1957 interview, Harry Westwick recalled that at the presentation "One of the players said 'We ought to call ourselves the Silver Seven.' and the name caught on right there."
[37]
(At the time, hockey teams iced seven men—a goaltender, three forwards, two defencemen and a
rover
).
The Silver Seven moved between three leagues during this time, and for a time were independent of any league. In February 1904, during the CAHL season, Ottawa resigned from the league in a dispute over the replaying of a game. The team had arrived late for a game in Montreal and the game had been called at midnight, with a tied score. The league demanded that the game be replayed. The club agreed to play only if the game mattered in the standings. The impasse led to Ottawa leaving the league. For the rest of that winter, the club played only in Cup challenge series. Quebec went on to win the championship of the league and demanded the Stanley Cup, but the Cup's trustees ruled that Ottawa still retained it. The trustees offered to arrange a challenge between Ottawa and the CAHL champion, but the CAHL refused to consider it.
[38]
The next season, Ottawa joined the
Federal Amateur Hockey League
(FAHL), winning the league championship. The club was only in the FAHL for one season, and the
Montreal Wanderers
became their new rival. For the 1906 season Ottawa, along with the Wanderers and several of the CAHL teams, formed the
Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association
(ECAHA), unifying the top teams into one league.
[39]
Style of play
[
edit
]
The Silver Seven were well known for the number of injuries that they inflicted on other teams. In a Stanley Cup challenge game in 1904, the Ottawas injured seven of the nine Winnipeg players, and the Winnipeg
Free Press
called it the "bloodiest game in Ottawa."
[40]
The next team to challenge the Ottawas, the
Toronto Marlboroughs
, were treated similarly. According to the Toronto
Globe
:
The style of hockey seems to be the only one known and people consider it quite proper and legitimate for a team to endeavor to incapacitate their opponents rather than to excel them in skill and speed ... slashing, tripping, the severest kind of cross-checking and a systematic method of hammering Marlboroughs on hand and wrists are the most effective points in Ottawa's style.
[40]
According to one player, the "Marlboroughs got off very easily. When Winnipeg Rowing Club played here, most of their players were carried off on stretchers."
[40]
This style of hockey would continue for years to come.
Dawson City challenge
[

Further information:
1904-05 FAHL season § Ottawa vs. Dawson City
The Silver Seven participated in perhaps the most famous
[41]
[42]
[43]
Stanley Cup challenge of all, that of
Dawson City
of the
Yukon
Territory in 1905. Organized by Joe Boyle, a Toronto-born prospector, who had struck it rich in the
Yukon gold rush
of 1898,
[44]
The
Dawson City Nuggets
had Lorne Hanna, who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a
1904 challenge
and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, who had played for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, who had played for
Queen's College
against the Montreal Victorias in an
1895 challenge
. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted in the summer of 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa, as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa.
[45]
Group picture of the Dawson City club, January 14, 1905, posed outside the Dey's Rink
To get to Ottawa, several thousand miles away, the club had to get to
Whitehorse
by overland sleigh, catch a train from there to
Skagway, Alaska
, then catch a steamer to
Vancouver
,
B.C.
and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by
dog sled
and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.
[46]
Despite the difficult journey, the Ottawas refused to change the date of the first game, only two days away. Ottawa arranged hospitable accommodations for the Dawson City team. The Yukoners received a huge welcome at the train station, had a welcoming dinner, and used the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club's rooms for the duration of their stay. Young did not arrive in time to play for Dawson.
[47]
The first game was close at the halfway point, Ottawa leading Dawson three to one. In the second half, the play became violent. Norman Watt of Dawson tripped Ottawa's
Art Moore
, who retaliated with a stick to the mouth of Watt. Watt promptly knocked Moore out, hitting him on the head with his stick. The game ended 9-2 for Ottawa. The game left a poor taste in the mouth for the Yukoners, who complained that several goals were
offside
.
[48]
After the game, Watt was quoted as saying "[Frank] McGee doesn't look like too much", as he had only scored once in the first game.
[49]
[50]
McGee scored four goals in the first half of the second match and 10 in the second half, leading Ottawa to a 23-2 score; his 14 goals remains a record for a single game of major senior hockey.
[50]
Eight of those 14 goals were scored consecutively in a span of less than nine minutes.
[51]
Despite this high score, the newspapers claimed that Albert Forrest, the Dawson City goalie, had played a "really fine game", otherwise the score "might have been doubled". Ottawa celebrated by hosting Dawson at a banquet. After this, the players took the Cup and attempted to
drop-kick
it over the
Rideau Canal
. The stunt was unsuccessful, as the Cup landed on the frozen ice and had to be retrieved the next day.
[48]
Considering the lopsided score of the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and did not belong to any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D. Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, it may have been the political connections that Joe Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time,
Clifford Sifton
, that got Dawson City the series.
[52]
Future Ottawa Senators owner Frank Ahearn later stated that Weldy Young had asked Ahearn to ask the Ottawa players to "not rub it in" as Dawson City did not expect to win. Ahearn mentioned this to McGee, who had had a row with Boyle when both were members of the Ottawa Rowing Club, and had not forgotten it.
[53]
Stanley Cup Challenge win streak
[
edit
]
The Ottawas were the dominant team for three years:
Defeated Montreal Victorias
in two-game total goals series 1-1, 8-0 on March 7 and 10, 1903, to win CAHL championship, and the Stanley Cup.
Defeated Rat Portage Thistles
in two-game total goals series 6-2,4-2 (10-4) on March 12-14, 1903.
Defeated Winnipeg Rowing Club
in best-of three series 9-1, 2-6, 2-0 on December 30, 1903, and January 1-4, 1904.
Defeated Toronto Marlboroughs
in two-game total goals series 6-3, 11-2 (17-5) on February 23-25, 1904.
Defeated Montreal Wanderers by forfeit
, after tying Montreal 5-5 on March 2, 1904. The Wanderers refused to continue the series unless the tie was replayed, and forfeited as a result.
Defeated Brandon, Manitoba
in two-game total goals series 6-3, 9-3 (15-6) on March 9-11, 1904.
Defeated Dawson City
in best-of-three series 9-2, 23-2 (2-0) on January 13-16, 1905.
Won 1905 FAHL championship
with record of 7 wins, 1 loss.
Defeated Rat Portage Thistles
in best-of-three series 3-9, 4-2, 5-4 on March 7, 9 and 11, 1905.
Defeated Queens University
in two-game total goals series 16-7, 12-7 (28-14) on February 27-28, 1906.
Defeated Smiths Falls, Ontario
in two-game total goals series 6-5, 8-2 (14-7) on March 6-8, 1906.
The end of the streak came in March 1906. Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers tied for the ECAHA league lead in 1906, forcing a
playoff series
for the league championship and the Cup. Montreal won the first game in Montreal by a score of 9-1. In the return match, Ottawa replaced their goaltender
Billy Hague
and used goaltender
Percy LeSueur
, formerly of Smiths Falls. In the return match in Ottawa, Ottawa overcame the eight-goal deficit, getting a 9-1 lead to tie the series by the midway point of the second half.
Harry Smith
then scored to put Ottawa ahead, only to have the goal ruled offside.
[54]
It was then that
Lester Patrick
of the Wanderers took it upon himself, scoring two goals to win the series 12-10. This was Frank McGee's last game and he scored two goals.
[55]
The players
Besides McGee, future Hall of Fame players
Billy Gilmour
, Percy LeSueur, Harvey Pulford, Alf Smith, Bouse Hutton and Harry Westwick played for the Ottawas. Alf Smith was also the coach. Other players of the 'Seven' included Arthur Allen, Dave Finnie, Arthur Fraser,
Horace Gaul
,
Dave Gilmour
,
Suddy Gilmour
,
Jim McGee
, Art Moore, Percy Sims,
Hamby Shore
,
Charles Spittal
, Frank White and Frank Wood.
The club was able to continue the streak despite the death of one of its members. Jim McGee, Frank McGee's brother, died after the 1904 season in a horseback riding accident.
[56]
He was also the Ottawa Football Club's captain at the time.
[57]
The funeral cortege was estimated at a half-mile in length, and it included Canadian prime minister
Wilfrid Laurier
.
[58]
Early professional era (1907-1917)
[
edit
]
Transition to professional (1907-1910)
[
edit
]
Until the 1906-07 season, the players were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the principles of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. The players could work for the government, and the work allowed the players to play for the team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the
International Professional Hockey League
(IPHL) was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could, therefore, compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status of each and every player had to be publicized.
[59]
The period saw the rivalry between the Senators and the Wanderers continue, and at times it was brutally contested. On January 12, 1907, a full-scale "donnybrook" took place between the two teams at a game in Montreal. Charles Spittal of Ottawa was described as "attempting to split Blachford's skull", Alf Smith hit Hod Stuart "across the temple with his stick, laying him out like a corpse" and Harry Smith cracked his stick across Ernie Johnson's face, breaking Johnson's nose.
[60]
[61]
Discipline was first attempted by the league at a meeting on January 18, in which the Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season, but this was voted down and the president of the league resigned.
[61]
The police arrested Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith on their next visit to Montreal,
[62]
leading to $20 fines for Spittal and Alf Smith and an acquittal for Harry Smith.
[61]
The tactics did not work on the Wanderers; they won the return match in Ottawa in March and went undefeated for the season, leaving Ottawa in second place.
[59]
However, it may have affected the Wanderers in another way: they lost the Stanley Cup a week after the donnybrook in a
Stanley Cup challenge series
to the
Kenora Thistles
.
The 1909 Ottawa Hockey Club Stanley Cup champion
The 1907-08 season was a season of change for Ottawa. Harry Smith and Hamby Shore left to join Winnipeg. Ottawa hired several free agents, including
Marty Walsh
,
Tommy Phillips
and
Fred 'The Listowel Whirlwind' Taylor
.
[63]
Taylor was hired away from the IPHL for the 1908 season for a $1000 salary and a guaranteed federal civil service job. He was an immediate sensation and earned a new nickname of 'Cyclone' for his fast skating and end-to-end rushes,
[64]
the nickname attributed to the Canadian governor-general
Earl Grey
.
[65]
Phillips was signed from Kenora to an even higher salary of $1,500 for the season, partially paid for by Ottawa sportsmen.
[66]
Ottawa moved into their new arena, simply dubbed
The Arena
, with seating for 4,500 and standing room for 2,500.
[67]
With the free-agent signings and the new arena, Ottawa started selling season-tickets, the first of their kind, $3.75 for five games, eventually selling 2,400.
[66]
The capacity was topped with a crowd of 7,100 in the home opener, attending a game against the Wanderers on January 11, which Ottawa won 12-2. However, Ottawa started the season with two losses out of three games and ended in second place behind the Wanderers again.
[68]
Walsh tied for the scoring lead with 28 goals in 9 games (including seven in one match), while Phillips was close behind at 26 goals in 10 games.
In 1908-09, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association became completely professional and changed its name to the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA). This led to the retirement of several stars, including Ottawa's Harvey Pulford and Montreal's Russell Bowie, who insisted on keeping their amateur status.
[69]
The Montreal Victorias and Montreal HC founded the
Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union
, leaving only Ottawa, Quebec, Montreal Wanderers and
Montreal Shamrocks
in the ECHA. It was another season of player turn-over for Ottawa. Besides Pulford, Ottawa lost Alf Smith, who formed a competing
Ottawa Senators
professional team in the Federal League, and Tommy Phillips, who joined Edmonton. The club picked up Bruce Stuart from the Wanderers,
Fred Lake
from Winnipeg and
Dubby Kerr
from Toronto. This lineup had a successful season, winning 10 out of 12 games. Walsh led all scorers with 38 goals in 12 games, while Stuart had 22 and Kerr had 20. The season was clinched with a win against the Wanderers on March 3 in Ottawa, 8-3, as Ottawa won the league and Stanley Cup.
[70]
Notable players of this time period include future Hall of Famers Percy LeSueur in goal, Dubby Kerr, Tommy Phillips, Harvey Pulford, Alf Smith, Bruce Stuart, Fred 'Cyclone' Taylor and Marty Walsh.
National Hockey Association (1910-1917)
[
edit
]
The 1909-10 hockey season saw major changes in the hockey world, as the ECHA organization split and created two organizations, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and the National Hockey Association (NHA). The CHA was formed to 'freeze out' the Wanderers, whose ownership change led the team to move to a smaller arena. At the same time, millionaire businessman J. Ambrose O'Brien, who wanted his Renfrew Creamery Kings to challenge for the Stanley Cup, saw his Renfrew application to join the CHA rejected. Together with the Wanderers, O'Brien instead decided to form the NHA, and founded the
Montreal Canadiens
.
[71]
The NHA became the fore-runner of today's
National Hockey League
.
Ottawa was one of the founders of the CHA and one of the teams that had rejected Renfrew. However, after a few poorly attended games showed that fans had no interest in the league, Ottawa and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA.
[72]
Ottawa, the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and Ottawa won in 1911 and 1915.
[73]
It is during the NHA period that the nickname "Ottawa Senators" came into common usage. Although there had been a competing Senators club in 1909, and there had been mention of the Senators nickname as early as 1901, the nickname was not adopted by the club.
[6]
The official name of the
Ottawa Hockey Club
remained in place until ownership changes in the 1930s.
Star player Cyclone Taylor had defected to Renfrew, and despite a salary war with Renfrew, Ottawa managed to re-sign their other top players, Dubby Kerr, Fred Lake and Marty Walsh for the
1909-10 season
.
[72]
On Taylor's first return in February 1910, he made a promise to score a goal while making a rush backwards against Ottawa. This led to incredible interest, with over 7,000 in attendance.
[74]
A bet of $100 was placed at the King Edward Hotel against him scoring at all.
[75]
Ottawa won 8-5 (scoring 3 goals in overtime) and kept Taylor off the scoresheet. Later in the season at the return match in Renfrew, Taylor made good on his boast with a goal scored backwards, although it was simply a goal scored on a
backhand shot
.
[76]
This was the final game of the season, and Ottawa had no chance at the league title and did not appear to have put in an effort in a 17-2 loss, considered "the worst trimming ever handed to a team wearing the Ottawa colors".
[77]
Ottawa Hockey Team, NH Association World Champions and Stanley Cup Holders, 1911 (HS85-10-23753)
In
1910-11
, the NHA contracted and imposed a salary cap, leading many of the Ottawa players to threaten to form a competing league. However, team owners controlled the rinks and the players accepted the new conditions. For Ottawa players, conditions did not deteriorate much as the club provided bonuses after the season.
[78]
Ottawa gained revenge for the previous loss to Renfrew by defeating Renfrew 19-5. The team went 13-3 to win the NHA and inherit the Stanley Cup; Marty Walsh and Dubby Kerr led the goal scoring with 37 and 32 goals in 16 games. After the season Ottawa played two challenges, against
Galt
, winning 7-4, and against
Port Arthur
, winning 13-4. In the Port Arthur game, Marty Walsh came close to matching Frank McGee's total, scoring ten goals.
[79]
1910-11 was the debut season of right wing
Jack Darragh
who scored 18 goals in 16 games.
The 1911-12 through 1913-14 seasons saw a decline for both Ottawa and the Wanderers. After the withdrawal of O'Brien's Renfrew team in 1911, the two clubs fought over the rights to Cyclone Taylor, who wanted to return to Ottawa, where his fiancé lived and he still had a government job. The NHA had given the Wanderers the rights to Taylor in a dispersal of the Renfrew players. Trade talks were unfruitful. Ottawa, insistent in their claim for Taylor, played him in one game for Ottawa against the Wanderers. The Senators won the game; however, Taylor was ineffectual.
[80]
The move backfired on the Senators, as the league ruled that the game could not stand and would have to be replayed. The Senators lost the replay and it was the difference in the league championship, as the defending champion Senators placed second by one game behind Quebec.
[81]
Quebec's
Bulldogs
won the only two Stanley Cup championships in the club's history that season and the next, and the
Toronto Blueshirts
won in 1914. Taylor did not play in the NHA again, as he joined Vancouver in the off-season.
[82]
The Senators finished fifth in
1912-13
and fourth in 1913-14. 1912-13 saw the debut of right wing
Punch Broadbent
, who scored 20 goals in 18 games.

Some players' sweaters have a two flags logo for war-time.
In
1914-15
, both Ottawa and the Wanderers bounced back to the top of the league, tying each other for the NHA season title. This was also the season that future Hall of Famer
Clint Benedict
became the Senators' top goaltender, taking over from Percy LeSueur. Former Wanderer
Art Ross
joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two-game playoff, 4-1. The Senators then played in the first inter-league Stanley Cup Finals playoff series with the
Vancouver Millionaires
of the
Pacific Coast
(PCHA) league. Cyclone Taylor, now of the Millionaires, haunted his old team, scoring six goals in three games as Ottawa lost three straight in Vancouver. Future Senator centreman
Frank Nighbor
played in this series for Vancouver and scored five goals.
[83]
In
1915-16
, the Senators placed second to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens. Punch Broadbent left the team to fight in World War I, while Frank Nighbor joined the Senators in his place and became the team's leading scorer. Nighbor had been signed away from Vancouver for the salary of $1,500, making him the highest-paid player on the club, ahead of Art Ross and Eddie Gerard.
[84]
Benedict led the league as the top goaltender for the first time.
[85]
With the wartime shortage of players, Rat Westwick and Billy Gilmour of 'Silver Seven' days attempted comebacks with the club but both played only two games before retiring for good.
[86]
In the off-season, Ottawa's president Llewellyn Bate proposed to suspend the team's operations until the end of the war. Gate receipts had declined 17 percent. The other NHA owners refused to suspend the league. Rather than simply cease operations, Bate and the other directors of the team turned it over to
Ted Dey
, owner of the Arena. Dey cut player salaries and let players go, including Art Ross to the Wanderers. Dey also fired manager Alf Smith, saving on his $750 salary.
[87]
In
1916-17
, the last season of the NHA, Ottawa won the second half of the split schedule. An Army team, the
Toronto 228th Battalion
, composed of enlisted professional players, joined the league before leaving for war after the first half-season. When the Battalion left, the other Toronto team, the Blueshirts was suspended by the league and its players dispersed including
Corb Denneny
, brother of
Cy Denneny
, who joined the Senators. Future Hall of Famer Cy had been picked up in a trade with Toronto earlier that season and he would be a member of the Senators until 1928. Benedict was the NHA's top goaltender once again, and Nighbor tied for the scoring lead with 41 goals in 19 games.
[88]
As second-half winners, the Senators played off in a series with the Canadiens, the first-half winners. The Senators ended their play in the NHA by losing a two-game total goals playoff series to the Canadiens, who eventually lost to Seattle in the Stanley Cup Finals. This season saw the final decline of Ottawa's old rivals, the Wanderers, who finished at the bottom of the standings. The next year, the Wanderers played only four games in the NHL, winning only one before folding the franchise after their home arena burned down.
[89]
While World War I affected all NHA teams, Ottawa was able to retain players and be competitive. The club finished no worse than second during the wartime seasons of 1914-15 to 1917-18.
[90]
Stanley Cup champions in 1906 and 1910: Historians' debate
[
edit
]
Due to the 'challenge' format of Stanley Cup play before 1915, there is often confusion about how many Stanley Cup championships the Senators should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The Senators were Stanley Cup champions at the end of nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905-06 and 1909-10, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions at the end of the season. The
Hockey Hall of Fame
and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the Senators were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup.
In 1906, Ottawa defeated OHA champions Queen's University and FAHL champions
Smiths Falls
in Stanley Cup challenges. However, Ottawa tied the Montreal Wanderers for the ECAHA regular season championship. To decide the ECAHA championship and the Stanley Cup, the Senators played a two-game total goals series against the Wanderers in March 1906 and lost. The 1906 hockey season ended with the Wanderers as the Stanley Cup champions. The Hockey Hall of Fame recognizes both Ottawa and the Wanderers as champions for that year,
[91]
as does the NHL.
[92]
In January 1910, Ottawa defeated Galt, champions of the
OPHL
, during the
CHA
regular season, as well as
Edmonton
of the
AAHA
during the NHA regular season (the Senators switched leagues in-between). At the end of the season, Ottawa gave up the Cup to the Montreal Wanderers, regular-season champions of the new NHA league. Unlike the 1906 case, the Hockey Hall of Fame does not recognize the Senators as champions for January 1910,
[91]
although the NHL does.
[92]
In October 1992, at the first game of the current
Ottawa Senators
NHL club, banners were raised to commemorate Stanley Cup wins in nine seasons, excluding 1906 and 1910. In media guides published by the club, they listed the original Senators as nine-time winners.
[93]
This changed in March 2003, when the team raised banners for the 1906 and 1910 years to join the other nine banners hanging at the
Corel Centre
. The club and the NHL now list the original Senators as 11-time winners.
[92]
NHL years (1917-1934)
[
edit
]
Clint Benedict
was outstanding for Ottawa
After struggling through the war years, the Ottawa Hockey Association put the club up for sale for $5,000 in the fall of 1917. Montreal Canadiens' owner George Kennedy was leading an effort to get rid of Toronto Blueshirts' owner
Eddie Livingstone
, and he needed the Senators in his corner. He loaned
Ottawa Citizen
sports editor
Tommy Gorman
(who also doubled as a press representative for the Canadiens) $2,500 to help buy into the Senators. Gorman, along with Martin Rosenthal and Ted Dey (owner of The Arena), bought the club. At a meeting held at
Montreal
's
Windsor Hotel
, the Senators, Canadiens, Wanderers and Bulldogs formed a new league—the National Hockey League—effectively leaving Livingstone in the NHA by himself. Gorman represented the Senators at the meeting. "A great day for hockey", he was quoted as saying, "Without [Livingstone] we can get down to the business of making money."
[94]
Within a year, Gorman and partner Ted Dey had made enough money to pay back Kennedy. Gorman also attended the following year's meeting of the NHA owners in which the final vote to suspend the league was made.
[95]
The Senators first season in the NHL,
1917-18
, did not go well. Salary squabbles delayed the home opener (on the league's first night, December 19, 1917
[96]
) as players protested that their contracts were for 20 games, while the season schedule was for 24. Enough players were appeased that the game started, 15 minutes late, while two players Hamby Shore and Jack Darragh, stayed in the dressing room while negotiations went on.
[97]
The Senators lost their home opener 7-4. The Senators lost their previous top rival, the Wanderers, after five games. The team struggled and finished in third place after the first half of the season. The club made player changes in the second half, getting
Horace Merrill
out of retirement and releasing
Dave Ritchie
. It was Shore's last season as he would die of pneumonia in October 1918. Shore's last career game was in the third-last game of the season and he was sat out for the last two games.
[98]
In the end, the team placed second in the second half and missed the playoffs. Cy Denneny led the team, coming second overall in scoring in the league with 36 goals in 20 games.
[99]
Prior to the 1918-19 season, ownership of the Senators changed. While Ted Dey negotiated with
Percy Quinn
for a lease for The Arena, Dey was also negotiating with Rosenthal over the lease, causing Rosenthal to seriously consider moving the team from The Arena back to
Aberdeen Pavilion
. However, it turned out that Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended up selling his share of the club to Dey, making Dey the majority owner in both the Arena and the hockey club. Rosenthal, a prominent local jeweller, had been involved with the club since 1903. Dey's machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone. The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs, binding them to the NHL for the next five years and locking out any rival league from their arenas.

1918-19
, the Senators won the second half of the split schedule. Clint Benedict had the top goalkeeper average, and Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor placed third and fourth in scoring with 18 and 17 goals in 18 games, respectively. The schedule was abbreviated by the
Toronto Arenas
club suspending operations, so the Senators and Canadiens played off in the first best-of-seven series. Due to a family bereavement, Ottawa was without star centre Frank Nighbor for the first three games and lost all three.
[101]
Ottawa asked to use Corb Denneny of Toronto, but the Canadiens turned down the request.
[102]
Nighbor returned for the fourth game in Ottawa, which Ottawa won 6-3. The series ended in five games, as the Canadiens won the final match 4-2 to win the series.
[103]
The Stanley Cup Finals between Montreal and Seattle was left undecided, as
an influenza outbreak
suspended the final.
[104]
The 'Super Six' (1920-1927)
[
edit
]
The "Super Six"
[105]
Senators of the 1920s are considered by the NHL to be its first
dynasty
.
[106]
The club won the Stanley Cup four times and placed first in the regular season seven times.
[106]
The team's success was based on the timely scoring of several forwards, including Frank Nighbor and Cy Denneny, and a defence-first policy, which led to the NHL changing the rules in 1924 to force defencemen to leave the defensive zone once the puck had left the zone.
[107]
The talent pool in Ottawa and the Ottawa valley was deep; the Senators traded away two future Hall of Famers (Clint Benedict and Punch Broadbent) in 1924 to make way for two prospects (
Alex Connell
and
Hooley Smith
), who would also become Hall of Famers.
[108]
Benedict and Broadbent led the
Montreal Maroons
to a playoff defeat of the Senators on the way to a Stanley Cup win in 1926.
[109]
In the
1919-20 season
, the NHL reactivated the Quebec Bulldogs NHA franchise; with this addition, the NHL played with four teams again. There were no playoffs, as Ottawa won both halves of the schedule, the undisputed NHL championship and the
O'Brien Cup
. Clint Benedict again led the league in goalkeeper goals-against average and Frank Nighbor came third in the league scoring race with 25 goals in 23 games.
[110]
The Senators then played the
Seattle Metropolitans
of the PCHA for the Stanley Cup. Because Seattle's red-white-green striped uniforms were nearly the same as Ottawa's red-white-black sweaters, the Senators played in simple white sweaters adorned with a large red "O" for this series.
[111]
The first three games were held in Ottawa (the first Stanley Cup games played in Ottawa since 1911) and ended with scores of 3-2 and 3-0 for Ottawa and 3-1 for Seattle. The first three games had been played on ice covered with water and slush due to warm weather in Ottawa. At this point, NHL president Calder moved the series to the
Arena Gardens
in Toronto, which had an
artificial ice
rink, the only one in eastern Canada at that time.
[112]
Seattle won 5-2 to tie the series, cheered on by the Toronto fans. In the fifth and deciding game, Ottawa won 6-1 on Jack Darragh's three goal performance and won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL.
[113]
It was after this win that T. P. Gorman dubbed the team the 'Super Six.'
[114]
See the article
1920 Stanley Cup Finals
.
In the
1920-21 season
, the league transferred two Senators players to help its competitive balance. Punch Broadbent was transferred to Hamilton while Sprague Cleghorn was transferred to Toronto.
[114]
Even without the two, the Senators won the first half of the season to qualify for the playoffs. By the end of the playoffs, both players were back with Ottawa. Benedict again led league in goalkeeper average and Cy Denneny came second in scoring with 34 goals in 24 games. The Senators shut out Toronto 7-0 in a two-game total goals playoff and went west to play off against Vancouver for the Stanley Cup. Vancouver still had Cyclone Taylor, though it was near the end of his career and he scored no goals. The best-of-five series was heavily attended, with 11,000 fans attending the first game, the largest crowd in history to see a hockey game up until that time
[115]
and a total attendance for the five-game series of over 51,000.
[116]
Ottawa won the series with scores of 1-2, 4-3, 3-2, 2-3 and 2-1, with Jack Darragh scoring the winning goal.
[117]
See the article
1921 Stanley Cup Finals
.
The
1921-22 season
saw Sprague Cleghorn leave and Jack Darragh retire, opening spaces for new defencemen
Frank Boucher
and
Frank "King" Clancy
.
[116]
Clancy's first goal came on his first shot, against Hamilton in overtime on February 7, and was noted for having actually come in (illegally) through the side of the net.
[118]
Broadbent and Cy Denneny, the "
Gold Dust Twins
", finished one and two in league scoring, together producing 59 of Ottawa's 106 goals.
[116]
Broadbent scored in 16 consecutive games, an NHL record, that as of 2020, still stands.
[119]
The Senators won the regular season title but lost to eventual Stanley Cup winner
Toronto St. Patricks
5-4 in a two-game total goals series. The series had the Boucher brothers play for Ottawa, while Cy Denneny played for Ottawa and his brother Corbett played for Toronto.
[120]
The 1922-23 Stanley Cup championship patch worn on their 1923-24 sweaters
In
1922-23
, the Senators were led by the league's top goalie Clint Benedict, the goal scoring of Cy Denneny and the return from retirement of Jack Darragh.
[121]
The season also saw the debut of defenceman
Lionel Hitchman
. An unsurpassed iron man record was set when Frank Nighbor played in six consecutive games without substitution, averaging a goal a game during the stretch.
[122]
The Senators won the regular season and took the playoff against the Canadiens 3-2 in a two-game total-goals playoff.
[123]
The Cup Final playoff format had changed. There were semi-finals against the PCHA champion, followed by the final against the WCHL champion. In the Cup semi-finals, Ottawa again faced Vancouver (now known as the Maroons) in Vancouver. New attendance records were set during this series, with 9,000 for the first game and 10,000 for the second. Ottawa won the series with scores of 1-0, 1-4, 3-2, and 4-1, with Benedict getting the shutout and Harry Broadbent scoring five goals. The Senators next had to play Edmonton in a best-of-three series and won it in two games with scores of 2-1 and 1-0, with Broadbent scoring the winning goal.
[124]
The second game of the finals is famous for being the game in which King Clancy (then only a substitute for the team) played all positions, including goal.
[125]
See the article
1923 Stanley Cup Finals
.
That year, club owners Dey and Gorman entered into a partnership with
Frank Ahearn
. Ahearn's family was well-off, owning the Ottawa Electric Company and the Ottawa Street Railway Company. Ted Dey then sold his share of the club and retired.
[126]
The first work of the partnership was a new arena, the
Ottawa Auditorium
, which was a 7,500 seat (10,000 capacity with standing room) arena with artificial ice. The new Ottawa Auditorium's first regular season game came on December 26, 1923. A crowd of 8,300 fans attended a game against the Canadiens, in which rookie
Howie Morenz
scored his first NHL goal.
[127]
The
1923-24 season
saw the Senators win the season but lose the playoff to the Canadiens, 0-1 and 2-4, with
Georges Vezina
getting the shutout and Morenz scoring three goals. Frank Nighbor was the first winner of the
Hart Trophy
as 'most valuable player' for his play in the regular season.
[128]
After the disappointing loss in the playoff series, goaltender Clint Benedict became embroiled in a controversy with the club over late nights and drinking. He was traded away, along with Harry Broadbent, to the new Montreal Maroons before the next season, for cash.
[129]
Ottawa hockey fans got to see a Stanley Cup Finals game played in Ottawa as the Auditorium hosted the final match of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Canadiens and the
Calgary Tigers
, moved because of poor natural ice at the Canadiens' arena.
[130]
Frank Nighbor with original Hart Trophy
The
1924-25 season
, the first year of NHL expansion to the United States, saw major changes in Ottawa's lineup. Jack Darragh retired and had died from appendicitis months after his final game.
[131]
Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith, who had played for Canada in the 1924 Olympics. Lionel Hitchman was sold to the expansion
Boston Bruins
and replaced by
Ed Gorman
. It was also the debut season of
Frank Finnigan
.
[128]
Off the ice, Gorman and Ahearn squabbled over ownership. In January 1925, during the season, Gorman sold his share of the Senators to Ahearn and left the Senators organization, later joining the expansion
New York Americans
.
[128]
With all the changes, the Senators slipped to fourth place in the standings. Cy Denneny continued his scoring ways, placing fourth in league scoring with 28 goals in 28 games.
[132]
Frank Nighbor became the first winner of the
Lady Byng Trophy
for gentlemanly play, donated by
Marie Evelyn Moreton
(Lady Byng), wife of
Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy
, who was Governor General of Canada from 1921 to 1926. Nighbor received the trophy personally from Lady Byng during a presentation at
Rideau Hall
.
[128]
Nighbor won the trophy in 1925-26 and 1926-27 as well.
The NHL expanded further into the United States in the
1925-26 season
with the new New York Americans and
Pittsburgh Pirates
. Ottawa won the league title, led by Alex Connell in goal, who recorded 15 shutouts in 36 games, and Cy Denneny, who scored 24 goals. The team received a bye to the playoff finals.
[109]
However, the Montreal Maroons won the two-game total goals series with scores of 1-1 and 1-0; former Senator Clint Benedict got the shutout. The Maroons went on to win the Stanley Cup against Victoria.
[133]
The season also marked the debut of future Hall of Famer
Hec Kilrea
.
The
1926-27 season
saw the NHL divided for the first time into two divisions, and they made the playoffs, winning the Canadian Division title. They advanced to the semi-finals and defeated the Canadiens, 4-0, and 1-1, en route to facing the Boston Bruins for the Cup. In the first series for the Stanley Cup with only NHL opponents, Ottawa defeated Boston with scores of 0-0, 3-1, 1-1 and 3-1, with the final game taking place in Ottawa; it would be the Senators' final Stanley Cup championship.
[134]
Alex Connell led the way in goal, allowing only three goals in the four games. Cy Denneny led the way in scoring with four goals, including the Cup winner. The Senators won three trophies as NHL champions, along with the Stanley Cup, the club also won two other trophies, the O'Brien Cup and the
Prince of Wales Trophy
, the last time the trophies were given to winners of the NHL championship. They would be given out to divisional winners in the following season. After the series, the Senators players received a parade in Ottawa, a civic banquet and an 18-carat gold ring with 14 small diamonds in the shape of an 'O'.

1927 Stanley Cup Finals

Decline (1927-1934)
[
edit
]
Ottawa had been by far the smallest market in the NHL even before American teams began playing in 1924. The later 1931 census listed only 110,000 people in the city of Ottawa—roughly one-fifth the size of
Toronto
, which was the league's second-smallest market. The team sought financial relief from the league as early as 1927. Despite winning the Stanley Cup, the Senators were already in financial trouble, having lost
CA$50,000
(equivalent to $778,022 in 2021) for the season.
[136]
The league's expansion to the United States did not benefit the Senators. Attendance was low for games against the expansion (American) teams, which provided a poor gate at home. There were also higher travel costs for away games, although the American arenas were larger. This fact was the basis for attempts to increase revenues, as the team played "home" games in other cities.
In the
1927-28 season
, the Senators played two "home" games in Detroit, collecting the bulk of the gate receipts (thus allowing them to actually turn a profit for that season), while
Jack Adams
retired to become the coach and general manager of the
Detroit Cougars
.
[134]
The brightest note from the campaign was goaltender Alex Connell's play, in which he set an NHL record (unsurpassed as of 2021) of six consecutive shutouts, a shutout run of 460 minutes and 49 seconds.
[137]
Taking advantage of a spending spree by the Montreal Maroons at the onset of the
1928-29 season
,
[137]
the Senators sold their star right wing Hooley Smith to the Maroons for $22,500 and the return of former star Punch Broadbent.
[138]
Also for cash, the team sent long-time member Cy Denneny to the Bruins. The club further repeated the scheme of playing two "home" games in Detroit en route to an undistinguished campaign in which they missed the playoffs for only the third time as an NHL team.
[138]
[139]
The team was sold in February 1929 to the
Ottawa Auditorium
for
CA$125,000
(equivalent to $1,923,913 in 2021). Ahearn had had offers rumoured to be as high as $250,000, but chose to keep the ownership local and the team in Ottawa. As well, Ahearn was a shareholder in the Auditorium which stood to lose its prime tenant.
[140]
The shareholders of the Auditorium financed the purchase with $125,000 of preferred shares in the Auditorium.
[140]
NHL president
Frank Calder
addressed an Ottawa Rotary Club meeting that February, and told the attendees: "The team cannot live on tradition and sentiment. In the last analysis, it depends on the people of Ottawa whether the team remains or not."
[140]
In the
1929-30 season
, with cash still hemorrhaging, the team transferred two scheduled home games to
Atlantic City
(one each against the
New York Rangers
and New York Americans), two to Detroit, and one to Boston.
[141]
The Senators rallied, however, to make the playoffs for what would be the final time, finishing third in the Canadian Division. The Senators faced off against the New York Rangers in a two-game total-goals series. In the last NHL playoff game in Ottawa until 1996, the Senators tied the Rangers 1-1 on March 28, 1930, but lost game two in New York 5-1 to lose the series 6-2.
[142]
The season also marked the debut of future star
Syd Howe
with the Senators while long-time star Frank Nighbor was sold to Toronto.
By the
1930-31 season
, the team was openly selling players to make ends meet. Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an unprecedented $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place for the first time since 1898.
[143]
In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of
Chicago Stadium
, including grain magnate
James E. Norris
, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, However,
Chicago Black Hawks
owner
Frederic McLaughlin
did not want another team in his territory and vetoed the deal.
[144]
Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings.
The Senators and the equally strapped
Philadelphia Quakers
asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for the
1931-32 season
in order to rebuild their fortunes. The league granted both requests on September 26, 1931. Ottawa received $25,000 for the use of its players, and the NHL co-signed a
Bank of Montreal
loan of $28,000 to the club.
[144]
The Senators seriously considered moving to Toronto, as
Conn Smythe
desired a second tenant for the new
Maple Leaf Gardens
. However, they balked when Smythe wanted a $100,000 guarantee, with a 40%/60% split of revenues.
[144]
While the Quakers never returned, the Senators resumed play after a one-year hiatus. Despite the return of players such as
Cooney Weiland
, Finnigan, Howe and Kilrea, the Senators finished with the worst record in the league in the two seasons that followed. Attendance was poor, the club only drawing well when the league's other three Canadian teams came to town.
[136]
Frank Finnigan recalled that they frequently played home games before small crowds of 3,500 to 4,000.
[136]
1932-33
saw the return of Cy Denneny to Ottawa as coach. He would last only the one season. In June 1933, former captain Harvey Pulford was given an option to buy the team and move it to
Baltimore
, but the option was never exercised.
[145]
In October 1933, Kilrea was sold for $10,000 to Toronto.
[146]
In December 1933, rumours surfaced that the Senators would merge with the equally strapped New York Americans; however, this was denied by Ottawa club president Frank Ahearn, who had sought financial help from the league.
[147]
The team played the full
1933-34 season
, transferring one home game to Detroit. Near the end of the season, reports surfaced that the club had entered into a deal with St. Louis "interests" to move the club.
[148]
The team lost its last home game by a score of 3-2 to the Americans on March 15, 1934, before a crowd of 6,500. The Senators had lent Alex Connell to the Americans when the Americans' goalie Worters was hurt, and he turned in a "sensational performance" for the visitors.
[149]
The home crowd was in a "throwing mood" and "carrots, parsnips, lemons, oranges and several other unidentified objects were thrown onto the ice continuously for no reason whatsoever."
[150]
The final game of the season was a 2-2 tie with the Maroons at the
Montreal Forum
on March 18, 1934.
[151]
1934: End of the first NHL era in Ottawa
[

The April 7, 1934, Ottawa Citizen headline
Despite finishing in last place for the second year in a row, the Senators actually improved their attendance over the previous season. Even with the increased gate, they barely survived the season. After the season ended, it was announced by Auditorium president F. D. Burpee that the franchise would not return to Ottawa for the 1934-35 season due to losses of
CA$60,000
(equivalent to $1,180,000 in 2021) over the previous two seasons. The losses were too great to be made up by the sale of players' contracts, and the club needed to be moved to "some very large city which has a large rink, if we are to protect the Auditorium shareholders and pay off our debts."
[152]
The NHL franchise was moved to
St. Louis, Missouri
, and operated as the
St. Louis Eagles
. The Eagles played only one season, finishing last again. After the NHL turned down a return to Ottawa, the NHL franchise suspended operations. The franchise returned to the NHL, and the players were dispersed to the other NHL teams.
[153]
Flash Hollett
was the last member of the original Senators to play in the NHL, retiring with the Detroit Red Wings in 1946.
The city of
Ottawa
did not have an NHL franchise again until the new Ottawa Senators franchise was awarded for the
1992-93 season
. The NHL presented the Senators with a "certificate of reinstatement" commemorating Ottawa's return to the league, and the current Senators honour the original franchise's 11 Stanley Cup wins. However, records for the two teams are kept separately. Frank Finnigan, the last surviving member of the original Senators' last Stanley Cup winner, played a key role in the drive to win an expansion franchise for Ottawa. He was slated to drop the puck in a ceremonial face-off for the new franchise's first game but died a year before that game took place. The new Senators honoured Finnigan by retiring his #8 jersey.
[154]
After the NHL franchise relocated, the Senators were continued as a
senior amateur club
in the Montreal Group of the
Quebec Amateur Hockey Association
(QAHA), beginning in the 1934-35 season.
[155]
One player,
Eddie Finnigan
, played for both the Senators and the Eagles in the 1934-35 season. The "Senior Senators" renewed the rivalry with Montreal-area senior amateur teams such as the Montreal Victorias that the old Senators had played in the years prior to turning openly professional. Later, Tommy Gorman bought the team and helped to found the Quebec Senior Hockey League. Winning the
Allan Cup
in 1949, the senior Senators continued until December 1954, finally ending the Senators' storied 71-year history.

Nicknames
[
edit
]
The club began in 1883 as the
Ottawa Hockey Club
and was known by that name officially, even after joining the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association (OAAA). Reports of the club in early play in the 1890s sometimes refer to the club as the
Generals
. The club is also referred to as the
Capitals
, although there was a competing Capital Athletic Association hockey team using that name. Other nicknames included the
Silver Seven
, a name the players gave themselves after receiving silver nuggets from manager Bob Shillington after the 1903 Stanley Cup win.
[37]
The
Super Six
name was given in the 1920s.
[105]
The first reference to the nickname of
Senators
was in a game report ("The Ottawas Made a Good Start") of the
Ottawa Journal
on January 7, 1901,
[157]
[158]
and used in other newspapers around that time.
[159]
While the nickname was used occasionally, the club continued to be known as the Ottawa Hockey Club. In 1909, a separate Ottawa Senators pro team existed in the Federal League. Ottawa newspapers referred to that club as the Senators, and the Ottawa HC as 'Ottawa', 'Ottawas' or the 'Ottawa Pro Hockey Club'.
The Globe
newspaper of Toronto first refers to the Ottawa Hockey Club as the Senators in an article entitled 'Quebec defeated Ottawa' on December 30, 1912.
[160]
Eventually this became the official nickname and was the only name used in descriptions of the club in NHL play.
Logos and sweaters
[
edit
]
1896-1897 Ottawa Hockey Club.
The team is in their 'barber-pole' sweaters.
For the first two years of their existence, Ottawa used red and black horizontally-striped sweaters.
[161]
The club then changed to sweaters of gold and blue
[12]
until it later affiliated with the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association in 1889. The team then adopted the colours of the OAAA organization: red, white and black. The logo of the team was a simplified version of the '
triskelion
' or 'winged legs' logo of the OAAA, which can be described as a "running wheel". The sweaters were solid white with the club logo in red. The players wore knee-length white pants with black stockings,
[16]
as shown in the 1891 team photo.
In 1896, the club first adopted the "barber-pole" design, with which the team became synonymous. The design was simple: strong horizontal stripes of red, black and white. Players wore white pants and red, white and black striped stockings. The basic design would be used for the rest of the organization's existence, except for one season, 1909-10, where the stripes were vertical and Montreal fans nicknamed the team derisively as 'les suisses', a slang term for
chipmunk
.
[162]
The "barber-pole" uniform was later adopted by the
Ottawa 67's
junior ice hockey team.
No logo was present on the sweater at first, and until 1930 logos were not used for more than a year at a time. During World War I, the club adopted a logo of flags to show allegiance to the war effort, as shown in the 1915 photo. After each Stanley Cup win, the club affixed a badge or logo stating "World Champions". In the 1929-30 season, the club added the "O" logo to the chest of the sweater.

Ownership
[
edit
]
From the start, the club was owned and operated by its members and known as the Ottawa Hockey Club, becoming an affiliate of the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association in 1889. In 1907, according to hockey historian Charles L. Coleman, some of the ownership was transferred to five of the players: Smith, Pulford, Moore, Westwick and LeSueur.
[63]
In 1911, the club incorporated itself and the organization took on the name of the "Ottawa Hockey Association".
[164]
In 1917, the club was separated from the Association and sold to Tommy Gorman, Ted Dey and Martin Rosenthal for $5,000 in time to join the National Hockey League.
[95]
In 1918, Rosenthal was forced out by Dey in a complex scheme. Dey was negotiating, as owner of The Arena, with both Rosenthal on behalf of the Senators and Percy Quinn (who held an option to purchase the Quebec NHA club) on behalf of a proposed new professional league over exclusive rights to the Arena for professional hockey. In a plan to derail the proposed new league, Dey maintained publicly that he had reserved the Arena for Quinn's proposed league when, in fact, he had not cashed a cheque received from Quinn to reserve an option on the Arena. Rosenthal, believing the club could no longer play at the Arena, attempted to find alternate arrangements for the club, including refurbishing Aberdeen Pavilion, but was unsuccessful. Dey purchased Rosenthal's share of the club on October 28, 1918, and Rosenthal resigned from the club.
[165]
Quinn filed a lawsuit against Dey for his deception but it was dismissed.
[166]
Quinn would get further action from the NHL, as the NHL suspended Quinn's franchise and took over its players' contracts.
[167]
In 1923, Dey retired after selling his ownership interest to Gorman and new investor Frank Ahearn.
[126]
Ahearn and Gorman had an uneasy partnership and at one point Gorman was going to buy out Ahearn. By January 1925, the deal was nearly finalized when Gorman backed out of the deal.
[168]
Instead, Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and a share of the
Connaught Park Racetrack
[128]
and Gorman moved on to New York to manage the New York Americans. In 1929, Ahearn sold the club to the Ottawa Auditorium corporation for $150,000, financed by a share issue.
William Foran
, the Stanley Cup trustee, became president of the club. As the auditorium did not meet its payments, Ahearn resumed a share of the club in 1931.
[169]
Likeness of 1930s '

In 1931, a dispute arose between Foran, in his role as Stanley Cup trustee, and the NHL. The
American Hockey League
had asked for a Stanley Cup challenge against the champions of the NHL. Foran had agreed to the challenge and ordered the NHL to comply, but the NHL refused to play the challenge. Foran was fired from his position as Senators' president and was replaced by Redmond Quain.
[170]
While the Ottawa Auditorium owned the hockey club, it was heavily indebted to Frank Ahearn and his father, and tried to clear its debt. In December 1930, the club was put up for sale for $200,000 under conditions it stay in Ottawa.
[171]
The best local bid was $100,000,
[172]
while a bid to move the club to Chicago was made for $300,000, ultimately denied by the Chicago Blackhawks ownership.
[173]
Later, the Auditorium tried to relocate the team to Baltimore under the ownership of former player Harvey Pulford.
[171]
A possible relocation to Toronto was also explored,
[174]
but in the end, no sales occurred.
In 1934, the club's NHL franchise was transferred to St. Louis, although the Association continued its ownership of the franchise and player contracts as well as the senior club. On October 15, 1935, the NHL bought back the franchise and players' contracts for $40,000 and suspended its operations again.
[175]
Under the agreement, the NHL paid for the players and took back possession of the franchise. If the franchise was resold, the proceeds would go to the Ottawa Hockey Association.
[176]
In July 1936, the Auditorium bond-holders foreclosed on the arena and it was put under the control of the Royal Securities Corporation. The senior club was sold in 1937 to James MacCaffery, the owner of the Ottawa Rough Riders football team. Former owner Tommy Gorman returned to Ottawa in 1944, when he purchased the club and the Auditorium.
[177]
He operated the senior team until December 1954, when he shut down the team over falling attendance, citing the "rise of hockey on television."
[156]
[178]
Fans
[
edit
]
When the Ottawa Hockey Club began play, there was no division between the ice surface and the stands like today. The fans became quite wet in the times when the temperature was warm. In the 1903 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Victorias, the Governor-General (who had a private box seat at the ice's edge) is recorded as getting wet from the play.
[179]
On another occasion, in the 1906 Stanley Cup Finals against the Wanderers, the Governor-General's top hat was knocked off by the stick of
Ernie "Moose" Johnson
.
[55]
The top hat was taken by a fan and given to Johnson.

One custom of the Ottawa fans towards opposition teams was to throw lemons. Cyclone Taylor, on his first visit back to Ottawa after signing with Renfrew, was pelted with lemons as well as a bottle.

The
Object 416
(Russian: Объект 416) is a Soviet prototype
self-propelled artillery
. It never went beyond prototype stage. It was intended to be a low profile
tank destroyer
.
History
[
edit
]
Object 416 was an odd experimental Soviet medium tank constructed in
Kharkov
by
Construction Bureau of Factory No. 75
. Development on the vehicle began in 1950. The technical project of the Object 416 tank was completed in the same year. In 1951 the vehicle was re-designated as an assault gun/tank destroyer. In 1953 the design was finalized after problems with the unusual turret had been solved.
A prototype was produced in 1951. After preliminary tests, a number of defects were identified, such as unreliable control drives and rotating contact devices, and many others. Due to the very low angle of the combat compartment, the crew's work was severely hampered. Due to the complexity of simultaneous traffic control and fire management, work towards the creation of the tank was stopped.
In 1952, the Object 416 passed state tests, but was not adopted. The reason was that in many respects the Object 416 was the same as the
SU-100P
, and in some ways it was worse, so the deployment of serial production was impractical.
The tank was never accepted for production, and only a single prototype was ever produced. The major problem with the vehicle was steering, due to the unusual placement of the driver, and the limited traverse of the turret made firing on the move difficult.
Description
[
edit
]
Hull and turret
[
edit
]
The Object 416 had a welded hull and a cast rotating turret. The M-63 gun were placed in the rotating turret on the back of the hull. The engine was placed in the front of the hull.
[1]
Armament
[
edit
]
The Object 416's gun was an M-63 cannon. The M-63 gun was developed at the SKB at the Motovilikha plant in
Perm
. The
D-10T
tank gun
was taken as a base design. The gun was equipped with a wedge shutter. To stabilize and resilience the gun during shooting, the gun was mounted with a quad-baffle
muzzle brake
and lowered the line of fire.
Engine and transmission
[
edit
]
The tank was powered by a 400 hp, flat
V12 engine
.
[1]
Other features
[
edit
]
The Object 416 has a headlight, IR light, MDH smoke generator, and horn. It is typical for Soviet tanks at the time.

The
Northwest Branch Saint John River
(
French
:
Décharge du Lac Frontière
) is a 15.5-mile-long (24.9 km)
[1]
river primarily in
Aroostook County, Maine
, USA. Its origin (
) is
Frontier Lake (Quebec-Maine)
in
Quebec
,
Canada
. After crossing the
Canada-United States border
, the Northwest Branch runs south close to the border until it picks up its
tributary
, the
Daaquam River
, which also flows out of Canada. 
The Northwest Branch then runs generally eastward to its
confluence
with the
Southwest Branch
to form the
Saint John River
.
Has current flowing in:
Montmagny Regional County Municipality
(RCM): municipality of
Lac-Frontière, Quebec
;
Aroostook County
: (township T11 R17 WELS), in the state of
Maine
;
Somerset County, Maine
: (township T10 R17 WELS), in the state of
Maine
.
On the Canadian side, the
road 283
runs along the Canada-US border on 6.4 kilometres (4.0 mi) and crosses the "Northwest Branch Saint John River" at the South East side of the
Frontier Lake (Quebec-Maine)
.
On the US side, a road from
Frontier Lake (Quebec-Maine)
moves Eastward through the mountains. In addition, a road runs on the North bank on a river segment, downstream of the confluence of the
Daaquam River
and serves the township T11 R17 WELS in the
North Maine Woods
.
Geography
[
edit
]
The river segment of 1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi) between the bridge of the
road 283
and the Canada-US border is considered an extension of
Frontier Lake (Quebec-Maine)
. Consequently, the "Northwest Branch Saint John River" officially rises at the US border and not at the mouth of Frontière Lake in the municipality of
Lac-Frontière, Quebec
.
This source is located at 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) Southeast of Lac Etchemin and 13.5 kilometres (8.4 mi) Northeast of the Canada-US border.
From its source, the "Northwest Branch Saint John River" flows on 20.7 kilometres (12.9 mi) of which 1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi) in
Quebec
and 19.6 kilometres (12.2 mi) in the
Maine
:
Higher courses of Northwest Branch Saint John River
(segment of 1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi) in
Quebec
)
1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi) to the South in the municipality of
Lac-Frontière, Quebec
, to the Canada-US border;
Intermediate Course of the Northwest Branch Saint John River
(segment of 9.9 kilometres (6.2 mi) in
Maine
, up to the confluence of the
Daaquam River
)
3.9 kilometres (2.4 mi) to the Southeast, up to the limit of the township T12 R17 WELS;
5.5 kilometres (3.4 mi) to the South and the Southwest, up to the confluence of the
Otter River (Northwest Branch Saint John River)
(from the West), located in the township T11 R17 WELS;
2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) to the Southeast, up to the confluence of the
Daaquam River
(from West);
Lower course of the Northwest Branch Saint John River
(segment of 9.7 kilometres (6.0 mi) downstream of the confluence of the
Daaquam River
)
0.6 kilometres (0.37 mi) Eastward up to Bean Creek (from the North);
6.3 kilometres (3.9 mi) to Southeast, up to Oak Brook (from the North);
1.3 kilometres (0.81 mi) Southward forming a curve to the East, up to the boundary between Bellechasse Township and the Township of St. John West, to the limit of

Chemical compound
Thionine
, also known as
Lauth's violet
, is the salt of a
heterocyclic compound
. It was firstly synthesised by
Charles Lauth
. A variety of salts are known including the chloride and acetate, called respectively
thionine chloride
and
thionine acetate
.  The dye is structurally related to
methylene blue
, which also features a
phenothiazine
core.
[1]
The dye's name is frequently misspelled with omission of the e, and is not to be confused with the plant protein
thionin
. The -ine ending indicates that the compound is an
amine
.
[2]
[3]
Dye properties and use
[
edit
]
Thionine is a strongly staining metachromatic dye, which is widely used for
biological staining
.
[4]
Thionine can also be used in place of
Schiff reagent
in quantitative
Feulgen staining
of DNA. It can also be used to mediate electron transfer in
microbial fuel cells
.
[5]
Thionine is a pH-dependent
redox indicator
with E
0
= 0.06 at pH 7.0. Its reduced form, leuco-thionine, is colorless.
When both the amines are dimethylated, the product tetramethyl thionine is the famous
methylene blue
, and the intermediates are
Azure C
(Monomethyl thionine),
Azure A
(when one of the amines is dimethylated and the other remains a primary amine), and
Azure B
(Trimethyl thionine). When
methylene blue
is "polychromed" by ripening (oxidized in solution or metabolized by fungal contamination,
[6]
as originally noted in the thesis of Dr D L Romanowski in 1890s), it forms thionine and all the Azure intermediates.

Haplogroup K
or
K-M9
is a genetic lineage within
human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup
. A sublineage of
haplogroup IJK
, K-M9, and its descendant clades represent a geographically widespread and diverse haplogroup. The lineages have long been found among males on every continent except
Antarctica
.
The direct descendants of K-M9 are
Haplogroup K2
(formerly KxLT; K-M526) and
Haplogroup K1
(L298 = P326, also known as LT).
[4]
[5]
Origins and distribution
[
edit
]
Y-DNA haplogroup K-M9 is an old lineage that arose approximately 47,000-50,000 years ago.
[6]
According to geneticist
Spencer Wells
, haplogroup K or the
Eurasian
clan, originated in the
Middle East
(perhaps
Iran
) or
Central Asia
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
It is likely that its descendant haplogroup P diverged somewhere in South Asia into P1, which expanded into Siberia and Northern Eurasia, and into P2, which expanded into Oceania and Southeast Asia.
[1]
Basal
K* is exceptionally rare and under-researched; while it has been reported at very low frequencies on many continents it is not always clear if the examples concerned have been screened for subclades.
[4]
[7]
Confirmed examples of K-M9* now appear to be most common amongst some populations in
Island South East Asia
and
Melanesia
.
[8]
[9]
[10]
Primary descendants of haplogroup LT are
L
(M20), also known as K1a, and
T
(M184), also known as K1b.
[4]
[5]
The descendants of haplogroup K2 include:
K2a
(detected in paleolithic specimens Oase1 and Ust'-Ishim),
[11]
the subclades of which include the major haplogroups
N
and
O
,
[12]
and;
K2b
- the ancestor of haplogroups
M
,
P
,
Q
,
R

LT
(L298; a.k.a. K1) has never been found in basal form (LT*). Subclades are widely distributed at low concentrations. Haplogroup L is found at its highest frequency in
India
,
Pakistan
and among the
Baloch
of Afghanistan. T is most common among:
Fulanis
,
Toubou
,
Tuareg
,
Somalis
,
Egyptians
, some
Middle East
,
[33]
the
Aegean Islands
and among
Kurru
,
Bauris
and
Lodha
in
India
.
K2
K2*
(M526) has been found in an estimated 27% of
indigenous Australians
(based on large scale surveys in which 56% of the samples were assumed to be non-indigenous.).
[34]
According to Mark Lipson et al.(2014), from MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States Of America, from his jurnal: "New  statistical  genetic methods for elucidating the history and evolution of human populations”,
K2*
(M526) has also been found in Toba-Batak and Mandar in an estimated 14%. Only Toba Batak and Mandar have
K2*
(M526) from indigenous Sunda land
[35]
K2a
(K-M2308)
[11]
K2a* - found only in the remains of
Ust'-Ishim man
, dating from approximately 45,000 BP and found in
Omsk Oblast
, Russia.
[11]
(These remains were initially classified, erroneously, as K2*.)
K-
M2313*
K-
M2313*
[11]
- so far found only in one
Telugu
male and one ethnic
Malay
, and ancient
Oase-1
.
NO
(M214; a.k.a. K2a2) - The two primary branches of NO include the major
haplogroups:
•
N
, which is found mainly in populations across
Northern Eurasia
(and at lower frequencies  in regions including East Asia, Central Asia,
Southeast Asia, Anatolia, and
Southeast Europe
) and;

G. Adolph Johnson
(1889-1985) was an American
architect
and politician from
Worcester, Massachusetts
.
Life and career
[
edit
]
Gustaf Adolph Johnson was born September 9, 1889, in Worcester to John A. Johnson and Christina (Fors) Johnson, both of whom had immigrated from Sweden in 1884. He attended public schools, graduating from the
English High School
in 1907. He then went to study in the
Washington
-based atelier of
Glenn Brown
, an
MIT
-trained architect. When he returned to Worcester, he took a job with the architect
George H. Clemence
. After a brief period, he accepted a position in the
Worcester Boys' Trade High School
, where he was an instructor in drawing. When the United States entered
World War I
in 1917, Johnson served in the governmental service department for the rehabilitation of disabled soldiers. This eventually took him to
Chicago
, where he attended classes in architecture at the
Armour Institute
. In Chicago he worked for
Patton, Holmes & Flinn
, where he worked on buildings for
Carleton College
in
Minnesota
.
[1]
When Johnson returned to Worcester in 1922, he opened his own office and began to practice as an architect.
[1]
For forty years he was associated with fellow architect
Jasper Rustigian
.
[a]
Though for the most part they shared only their resources, not their projects, for part of the 1940s and 1950s they were in a formal partnership, the firm then being known as Johnson & Rustigian, and briefly as Johnson, Rustigian & Kunz with a third partner. Johnson continued to practice into the 1960s.
Johnson was a member of the Worcester chapter of the
American Institute of Architects
, but was not a member of the national organization.
[1]
Political and personal life
[
edit
]
Johnson was a Republican. He was a member of the Worcester City Council from 1924 to 1926, and a member of the
Massachusetts House of Representatives
from the
17th Worcester
district in 1927-28.
[1]
[3]
In addition to his professional affiliations, Johnson was also a member of a number of social and fraternal organizations. He was a director of the Skandia Bank and Trust Company of Worcester and a trustee of
Fairlawn
Hospital.
[1]
Johnson married in 1914, to Signe C. Thorn of Worcester. They had no children.
[1]
He died June 27, 1985, in Westborough.

The
County of Victoria
, or
Victoria County
, was a county in the Canadian province of
Ontario
. It was formed in 1854 as
The United Counties of Peterborough and Victoria
, and separated from Peterborough in 1863. In 2001, the county was dissolved and reformed as the city of
Kawartha Lakes
. Though first opened to settlement in 1821, the area that was encompassed by Victoria County has a history of Indian occupation, first by the Hurons.
History
[
edit
]
The history of Victoria County began with the passing of the
Constitutional Act
in 1791, dividing Canada into two provinces:
Upper Canada
(present day Ontario) and
Lower Canada
(present day
Québec
); and appointing a lieutenant-governor for each.
[1]
The first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada was Colonel
John Graves Simcoe
, who
surveyed
the province and set out tracts of land for
immigrants
with genuine interests.
[2]
Before the land that became Victoria County could be surveyed, however, speculators had Simcoe removed from office in 1796, and the land was secured from settlement for over 20 years.
[3]
Following the
War of 1812
, a large wave of immigration prompted the province to purchase more land from local Indian tribes. On 5 November 1818, six Mississauga chiefs, Buckquaquet of the Eagles, Pishikinse of the Reindeers, Paudash of the Cranes, Cahgahkishinse of the Pike, Cahgageewin of the Snakes, and Pininse of the White Oaks, met in
Port Hope
. There they surrendered the rights to over four thousand square kilometres of land,
[4]
known as the "Mississauga Tract". In exchange, the Indians (numbering about 400) were to receive $750 per year in goods. However, the government later changed this to $10 per year for each living person born before the deal was signed.
The Mississauga Tract included all of Victoria and Peterborough counties, as well as parts of 28 adjacent townships.
[5]
Following the purchase, the land became
Newcastle District
in 1802.
[6]
In 1845, it was renamed
Colborne District
consisting of the
County of Peterborough
.
[7]
In 1851, Peterborough County was divided into the counties of Peterborough and Victoria, which were united for municipal purposes as the United Counties of Peterborough and Victoria.

Extent of Victoria county in 1974, showing the annexation of
Manvers Township
.
A
plebiscite
was authorized in 1856 to facilitate the creation of a
provisional county council
for Victoria,
[9]
but, as the united counties council delayed conducting it, a further Act was passed in 1861 to compel its being held, following which the provisional council was formed.
[10]
and its formal separation took place in 1863.
[11]
[12]
Further townships were surveyed in the following years that were attached to the County, extending its reach northwards. In 1868, the townships of Ryde, Draper, Macaulay, Stephenson, Brunel, McLean and Oakley were detached from the County and transferred to the new
District of Muskoka
,
[13]
and the townships of Stisted, Chaffey, Franklin and Ridout were detached in a similar manner in 1873.
[14]
They were not withdrawn for municipal purposes until their annexation to
Simcoe County
in 1877.
[15]
The townships of Anson, Hindon and Lutterworth were also withdrawn from the County in 1874 and transferred to the new
Provisional County of Haliburton
.
[16]
In 1974, as a result of the creation of the
Regional Municipality of Durham
,
Manvers Township
was withdrawn from
Durham County
and transferred to Victoria County.
[17]
On 1 January 2001, Victoria County was dissolved, and its townships and incorporated communities were amalgamated to form the
City of Kawartha Lakes
,
[18]
a name chosen because of the prominence of
the lakes
in the geography of the region.
[19]
Organization before amalgamation in 2001
[
edit
]
It encompassed 2,855.56 square kilometres (1,102.54 sq mi)
[20]
Townships
[
edit
]
Victoria County consisted of 13 separate townships and 6
incorporated
villages with their own local governments.

Infrastructure

Colonization roads
[

Victoria County was first opened up to settlement in the 1821.
[65]
At this time, the primary routes for entering the county-to-be were narrow trails. Settlers were offered land on the condition that they help further the progress of
concession roads
into the region. This was often met with the bare minimum, and progress was slow.
The Land Act of 1853 provided funding for the development of roads throughout the wilderness of Upper Canada. Grants were administered by the Department of Agriculture to survey and build the new roads. The roads followed the tradition of old
Roman roads
, and cut through the wilderness in a straight line, veering only when the terrain was impassable, but cutting through swamps and hills otherwise. Four primary roads were built: the Cameron Road, the Bobcaygeon Road, the Monck Road, and the Portage Road.
The Cameron road, now mostly encompassed by
Highway 35
, provided access from Lake Ontario to the northern limits of Victoria;
The Bobcaygeon Road, begun in 1853, traversed north and south along the present-day eastern boundary of the region, and is mostly encompassed by former
Highway 121
;
The Monck Road, which connected
Lake Couchiching
to
Bancroft
, encompassed partially by former
Highway 503
, now City Road 45;
The Portage Road, connecting Lake Simcoe to Balsam Lake, encompassed entirely by former
Highway 48
, now City Road 48
Education
[
edit
]
At one time the Victoria County Board of Education provided educational services. In 1999 it was amalgamated into the
Trillium Lakelands District School Board
.

Two human polls and a committee's selections comprised the
2015
National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA)
Division I
Football Bowl Subdivision
(FBS) football rankings
, in addition to various publications' preseason polls. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a
national championship
, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the
AP Poll
and the
Coaches Poll
. One additional poll is released midway through the season; the
College Football Playoff
(CFP) rankings are released after the eighth week.
This was the second season of the four-team College Football Playoff system which replaced the previous
Bowl Championship Series
system. At the conclusion of the regular season, on Sunday, December 6, 2015, the final CFP rankings will determine who will play in the two
bowl games
designated as semifinals for the
2016 College Football Playoff National Championship
on January 11, 2016, at
University of Phoenix Stadium
in
Phoenix, Arizona
.

Cohomology theory
Not to be confused with
Eichler-Shimura relation
.
In
mathematics
,
Eichler cohomology
(also called
parabolic cohomology
or
cuspidal cohomology
) is a cohomology theory for
Fuchsian groups
, introduced by
Eichler
(
1957
), that is a variation of group cohomology analogous to the image of the
cohomology with compact support
in the ordinary cohomology group. The
Eichler-Shimura isomorphism
, introduced by Eichler for complex cohomology and by
Shimura
(
1959
) for real cohomology, is an isomorphism between an Eichler cohomology group and a space of cusp forms. There are several variations of the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism, because one can use either real or complex coefficients, and can also use either Eichler cohomology or ordinary group cohomology as in (
Gunning 1961
). There is also a variation of the Eichler-Shimura isomorphisms using
l
-adic cohomology
instead of real cohomology, which relates the coefficients of cusp forms to eigenvalues of
Frobenius
acting on these groups.
Deligne (1971)
used this to reduce the
Ramanujan conjecture
to the
Weil conjectures
that he later proved.
Eichler cohomology
[
edit
]
If
G
is a
Fuchsian group
and
M
is a representation of it then the Eichler cohomology group
H
1
P
(
G
,
M
) is defined to be the kernel of the map from
H
1
(
G
,
M
) to 
Π
c
H
1
(
G
c
,
M
), where the product is over the cusps
c
of a fundamental domain of
G
, and
G
c
is the subgroup fixing the cusp
c
.

Incidents
[
edit
]
In 1992, state troopers executed a search warrant without
knocking and announcing
themselves. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the action violated the Fourth Amendment in
Wilson v. Arkansas
.
[16]
In 1993, several state troopers claimed that they assisted then Governor Bill Clinton to cover extramarital affairs in what became known as
"Troopergate"
.
[17]
No official state inquiry was performed.
On March 7, 2006, trooper Larry P. Norman
fatally shot Joseph Erin Hamley
, an unarmed man with cerebral palsy as he lay on his back.
[18]
On June 28, 2007, Norman pleaded guilty to negligent homicide based on the dashcam footage and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, 30 days of community service, one year of probation, and a $1,000 fine.
[19]
Norman served 54 days of his jail sentence.
[20]
The Arkansas State Police settled a
lawsuit
on March 5, 2007, with the victim's family for one million dollars.
[21]
In July 2020, Senior Cpl. Rodney Dunn performed a
PIT maneuver
against a pregnant woman during a traffic stop. Shortly thereafter, the woman filed a lawsuit against the department, claiming that she was in the process of pulling over, and that the actions of Dunn were reckless and nearly killed her and her unborn child. The Arkansas State Police has defended the trooper's actions and argue neither he nor the department bear any responsibility for the incident.
[22]
The Arkansas State Police and the woman have settled the lawsuit in November 2021.

Grandborough
is a small village and
civil parish
in the
Rugby
district, in the county of
Warwickshire
, England. The parish includes the
hamlets
of
Calcutt
,
Grandborough Fields
and
Woolscott
. The population of the civil parish at the
2011 census
was 424.
[1]
Grandborough is in a rural area of eastern Warwickshire, around six miles (10 km) south of
Rugby
and six miles northwest of
Daventry
,
Northamptonshire
. Grandborough is about two miles from the nearest main roads and can be reached by country lanes from the
A45
to the east, and the
A426
to the west.
The
River Leam
flows north of the village. There was a watermill (now a private residence) where the river passed under the road from Woolscott. In times of flood, the river flows over the road creating a
ford
. A road sign suggests that pedestrians and motorists should "Use causeway if flooded".
Grandborough's church is dedicated to St Peter. The church spire, and the two tall
Wellingtonia
trees which flank it, are notable local landmarks. There is also a
Primitive Methodist
chapel (erected in 1856, extended in 1991, but closed in November 2021), a village hall (the Benn Memorial Hall, erected in 1897) and a number of old (mostly
Victorian
) cottages. The village has a
pub
called the
Shoulder of Mutton
. In Main Street there is a private house which was formerly a pub called the
Royal George
.
Harrow House
, in Woolscott, was formerly a pub called the
Old Harrow Inn
.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Grandborough was mentioned in the
Domesday Book
as
Graensburgh
. Until the early 20th century the name was spelt as
Granborough
. Its name was supposed by
Eilert Ekwall
to come from
Anglo-Saxon
Grēnbeorg
= "green rounded hill", but the Domesday Book form points otherwise. It appears as
Granborowe
on the
Christopher Saxton
map of 1637.
The former village school still stands. It closed in April 1974
[3]
and is now a private house. A stone plaque hidden on an east-facing wall has the inscription
"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it"
and the date 1840.
[2]
The quotation is taken from the
Book of Proverbs
, chapter 22, verse 6.
[4]
The first mention of a
post office
in the village is the issue in April 1847 of a type of
postmark
known as an undated circle (with the spelling Granborough).
[5]
The post office and village shop closed on 4 April 1997.

Hollow Lacedaemon. Site of the Menelaion, the ancient shrine to Helen and Menelaus constructed in the Bronze Age city that stood on the hill of
Therapne
on the left bank of the
Eurotas River
overlooking the future site of Dorian Sparta. Across the valley the successive ridges of Mount
Taygetus
are in evidence.
Sparta
[1]
was a prominent
city-state
in
Laconia
in
ancient Greece
. In antiquity, the city-state was known as
Lacedaemon
(
Λακεδαίμων
,
Lakedaímōn
), while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the
Eurotas River
in Laconia, in south-eastern
Peloponnese
.
[2]
Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant
military land-power
in ancient Greece.
Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the
Greco-Persian Wars
, in rivalry with the rising naval power of
Athens
.
[3]
Sparta was the principal enemy of
Athens
during the
Peloponnesian War
(431-404 BC),
[4]
from which it emerged victorious after the
Battle of Aegospotami
. The decisive
Battle of Leuctra
against
Thebes
in 371 BC ended the
Spartan hegemony
, although the city-state maintained its
political independence
until its forced integration into the
Achaean League
in 192 BC. The city nevertheless recovered much autonomy after the
Roman conquest of Greece
in
146 BC
and prospered during the
Roman Empire
, as its antiquarian customs attracted many Roman tourists. However, Sparta was sacked in 396 AD by the
Visigothic
king
Alaric
, and underwent a long period of decline, especially in the
Middle Ages
, when many of its citizens moved to
Mystras
.
Modern Sparta
is the capital of the southern Greek region of Laconia and a center for processing citrus and olives.
Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its
social system
and
constitution
, which were supposedly introduced by the semi-mythical legislator
Lycurgus
. His laws configured the Spartan
society
to maximize military proficiency at all costs, focusing all
social institutions
on
military training
and physical development. The inhabitants of Sparta were stratified as
Spartiates
(citizens with full rights),
mothakes
(free non-Spartiate people descended from Spartans),
perioikoi
(free non-Spartiates), and
helots
(state-owned enslaved non-Spartan locals). Spartiate men underwent the rigorous
agoge
training regimen, and Spartan
phalanx
brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle.
Spartan women
enjoyed considerably more
rights
than elsewhere in
classical antiquity
.
Sparta was frequently a subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in
Western culture
following the revival of classical learning. The admiration of Sparta is known as
Laconophilia
.
Bertrand Russell
wrote:
Sparta had a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality, and through the myth.... The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato's political theory, and that of countless subsequent writers.... [The] ideals that it favors had a great part in framing the doctrines of
Rousseau
,
Nietzsche
, and
National Socialism
.
[5]
Names
The earliest attested term referring to Lacedaemon is the
Mycenaean Greek
𐀨𐀐𐀅𐀖𐀛𐀍
,
ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo
, "Lakedaimonian", written in
Linear B
syllabic script,
[6]
[n 1]
the equivalent of the later
Greek
Λακεδαιμόνιος
,
Lakedaimonios
(
Latin
:
Lacedaemonius
).
[12]
[13]
Eurotas River
The
ancient Greeks
used one of three words to refer to the Spartan city-state and its location. First, "Sparta" refers primarily to the main cluster of settlements in the valley of the
Eurotas River
.
[14]
The second word, "Lacedaemon" (
Λακεδαίμων
),
[15]
was often used as an adjective and is the name referenced in the works of
Homer
and the historians
Herodotus
and
Thucydides
. The third term, "Laconice" (
Λακωνική
), referred to the immediate area around the town of Sparta, the plateau east of the Taygetos mountains,
[16]
and sometimes to all the regions under direct Spartan control, including
Messenia
.
Herodotus seems to use "Lacedaemon" for the
Mycenaean Greek
citadel at
Therapne
, in contrast to the lower town of Sparta. This term could be used synonymously with Sparta, but typically it denoted the terrain in which the city was located.
[17]
In Homer it is typically combined with epithets of the countryside: wide, lovely, shining and most often hollow and broken (full of ravines),
[18]
suggesting the
Eurotas Valley
. "Sparta" on the other hand is described as "the country of lovely women", an epithet for people.
The residents of Sparta were often called Lacedaemonians. This epithet utilized the plural of the adjective Lacedaemonius (Greek:
Λακεδαιμόνιοι
; Latin:
Lacedaemonii
, but also
Lacedaemones
). The ancients sometimes used a
back-formation
, referring to the land of Lacedaemon as
Lacedaemonian country
. As most words for "country" were feminine, the adjective was in the feminine:
Lacedaemonia
(
Λακεδαιμονία
,
Lakedaimonia
). Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.
"Lacedaemonia" was not in general use during the classical period and before. It does occur in Greek as an equivalent of Laconia and Messenia during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, mostly in
ethnographers
and
lexica
of place names. For example,
Hesychius of Alexandria
's
Lexicon
(5th century AD) defines Agiadae as a "place in Lacedaemonia" named after Agis.
[19]
The actual transition may be captured by
Isidore of Seville
's
Etymologiae
(7th century AD), an
etymological dictionary
. Isidore relied heavily on
Orosius
'
Historiarum Adversum Paganos
(5th century AD) and
Eusebius of Caesarea
's
Chronicon
(early 5th century AD), as did Orosius. The latter defines Sparta to be
Lacedaemonia Civitas
,
[20]
but Isidore defines Lacedaemonia as founded by Lacedaemon, son of Semele, which is consistent with Eusebius' explanation.
[21]
There is a rare use, perhaps the earliest of "Lacedaemonia", in
Diodorus Siculus
' The Library of History,
[22]
but probably with
Χώρα
(‘’chōra’’, "country") suppressed.
Lakedaimona was until 2006 the name of a
province
in the modern Greek
prefecture
of
Laconia
.
Geography
Antique Map of Classical City of Sparta (based on ancient sources and not archaeology).
Sparta is located in the region of Laconia, in the south-eastern
Peloponnese
. Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the
Eurotas River
, the largest river of Laconia, which provided it with a source of fresh water. The valley of the Eurotas is a natural fortress, bounded to the west by
Mt. Taygetus
(2,407 m) and to the east by
Mt. Parnon
(1,935 m). To the north, Laconia is separated from
Arcadia
by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude. These natural defenses worked to Sparta's advantage and protected it from sacking and
invasion
.  Though landlocked, Sparta had a vassal harbor,
Gytheio
, on the
Laconian Gulf
.
Mythology
Lacedaemon
(Greek:
Λακεδαίμων
) was a
mythical
king of Laconia.
[23]
The son of
Zeus
by the nymph
Taygete
,  he married
Sparta
, the daughter of
Eurotas
, by whom he became the father of
Amyclas
,
Eurydice
, and Asine. As king, he named his country after himself and the city after his wife.
[23]
He was believed to have built the sanctuary of the
Charites
, which stood between Sparta and
Amyclae
, and to have given to those divinities the names of
Cleta
and
Phaenna
. A
shrine
was erected to him in the neighborhood of
Therapne
.
Tyrtaeus
, an archaic era Spartan writer, is the earliest source to connect the origin myth of the Spartans to the lineage of the hero
Heracles
; later authors, such as
Diodorus Siculus
, Herodotus, and
Apollodorus
, also made mention of Spartans understanding themselves to be descendants of Heracles.
[24]

Archaeology of the classical period

Mt. Taygetus
in the background.
Thucydides
wrote:
Suppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame.  Their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages, like the ancient towns of Hellas, and would therefore make a poor show.
[28]
[29]
Until the early 20th century, the chief ancient buildings at Sparta were the
theatre
, of which, however, little showed above ground except portions of the
retaining walls
; the so-called Tomb of
Leonidas
, a quadrangular building, perhaps a temple, constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers; the foundation of an ancient bridge over the
Eurotas
; the ruins of a circular structure; some remains of late Roman
fortifications
; several brick buildings and
mosaic pavements.
[28]
The remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions, sculptures, and other objects collected in the local museum, founded by Stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907. Partial
excavation
of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the
American School at Athens
. The structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of Hellenic origin that was partly restored during the Roman period.
[28]
Ruins of the Temple of Artemis Orthia
In 1904, the
British School at Athens
began a thorough exploration of
Laconia
, and in the following year excavations were made at
Thalamae
,
Geronthrae
, and Angelona near
Monemvasia
. In 1906, excavations began in Sparta itself.
[28]
A "small circus" (as described by
Leake
) proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after 200 AD around the altar and in front of the
Temple of Artemis Orthia
. It is believed that musical and gymnastic contests took place here, as well as the famous flogging ordeal administered to Spartan boys (
diamastigosis
). The temple, which can be dated to the 2nd century BC, rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century, and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple, dating from the 9th or even the 10th century. The
votive offerings
in clay, amber, bronze, ivory and lead dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC, which were found in great profusion within the precinct range, supply invaluable information about early Spartan art.
[28]
Remaining section of wall that surrounded ancient Sparta
In 1907, the location of the sanctuary of
Athena
"of the Brazen House" (Χαλκίοικος, Chalkioikos) was determined to be on the
acropolis
immediately above the theatre. Though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed, the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription in Laconia, numerous bronze nails and plates, and a considerable number of votive offerings. The
city-wall
, built in successive stages from the 4th to the 2nd century, was traced for a great part of its circuit, which measured 48 stades or nearly 10 km (6 miles) (Polyb. 1X. 21). The late Roman wall enclosing the acropolis, part of which probably dates from the years following the Gothic raid of 262 AD, was also investigated. Besides the actual buildings discovered, a number of points were situated and mapped in a general study of Spartan topography, based upon the description of
Pausanias
.
[28]
In terms of domestic archaeology, little is known about Spartan houses and villages before the Archaic period, but the best evidence comes from excavations at
Nichoria
in
Messenia
where postholes have been found. These villages were open and consisted of small and simple houses built with stone foundations and clay walls.
[30]
Menelaion
Main article:
Menelaion
The
Menelaion
The
Menelaion
is a shrine associated with
Menelaus
, located east of Sparta, by the river Eurotas, on the hill
Profitis Ilias
(
Coordinates
:
). Built around the early 8th century BC, the Spartans believed it had been the former residence of Menelaus. In 1970, the British School in Athens started excavations around the Menelaion in an attempt to locate Mycenaean remains in the area. Among other findings, they uncovered the remains of two Mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to
Helen
and Menelaus. These mansions were destroyed by
earthquake
and fire, and archaeologists consider them the possible palace of Menelaus himself.
[31]
[

]
Excavations
made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around the Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of
Mycenaean Laconia
.
[32]
The Mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north. Its area was approximately equal to that of the "newer" Sparta, but
denudation
has wreaked havoc with its buildings and nothing is left of its original structures save for ruined foundations and broken
potsherds
.
[28]
History
Main article:
History of Sparta
Prehistory, "dark age" and archaic period
The prehistory of Sparta is difficult to reconstruct because the literary evidence was written far later than the events it describes and is distorted by oral tradition.
[33]
The earliest certain evidence of human settlement in the region of Sparta consists of
pottery
dating from the Middle
Neolithic
period, found in the vicinity of Kouphovouno some two kilometres (1.2 miles) south-southwest of Sparta.
[34]
This civilization seems to have fallen into decline by the late
Bronze Age
, when, according to Herodotus, Macedonian tribes from the north (called
Dorians
by those they conquered) marched into the Peloponnese and, subjugating the local tribes, settled there.
[33]
The Dorians seem to have set about expanding the frontiers of Spartan territory almost before they had established their own state.
[35]
They fought against the
Argive
Dorians to the east and southeast, and also the
Arcadian
Achaeans to the northwest.  The evidence suggests that Sparta, relatively inaccessible because of the topography of the Taygetan plain, was secure from early on: it was never fortified.
[35]
Lycurgus
Nothing distinctive in the archaeology of the Eurotas River Valley identifies the Dorians or the Dorian Spartan state. The prehistory of the Neolithic, the Bronze Age and the Dark Age (the Early Iron Age) at this moment must be treated apart from the stream of Dorian Spartan history.
[

The legendary period of Spartan history is believed to fall into the Dark Age. It treats the mythic heroes such as the
Heraclids
and the
Perseids
, offering a view of the occupation of the Peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements. The subsequent proto-historic period, combining both legend and historical fragments, offers the first credible history.
Between the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Spartans experienced a period of lawlessness and civil strife, later attested by both Herodotus and Thucydides.
[36]
As a result, they carried out a series of political and social reforms of their own society which they later attributed to a semi-mythical lawgiver,
Lycurgus
.
[37]
Several writers throughout antiquity, including Herodotus, Xenophon, and Plutarch have attempted to explain Spartan exceptionalism as a result of the so-called Lycurgan Reforms.
[38]
[39]
[40]
Classical Sparta
In the
Second Messenian War
, Sparta established itself as a local power in the Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece. During the following centuries, Sparta's reputation as a land-fighting force was unequalled.
[41]
At its peak around 500 BC, Sparta had some 20,000-35,000 citizens, plus numerous helots and perioikoi. The likely total of 40,000-50,000 made Sparta one of the larger Greek city-states;
[42]
[43]
however, according to Thucydides, the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000-610,000, making it much larger.
[n 2]
In 480 BC, a small force led by King
Leonidas
(about 300 full Spartiates, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, although these numbers were lessened by earlier casualties
[45]
) made a legendary
last stand
at the
Battle of Thermopylae
against the massive Persian army, led by
Xerxes
.
[46]
The Spartans received advance warning of the Persian invasion from their deposed king
Demaratus
, which prompted them to consult the Delphic oracle. According to Herodotus, the
Pythia
proclaimed that either one of the kings of Sparta had to die or Sparta would be destroyed.
[47]
This prophecy was fulfilled after king Leonidas died in the battle. The superior weaponry, strategy, and
bronze
armour of the Greek
hoplites
and their
phalanx
fighting formation again proved their worth one year later when Sparta assembled its full strength and led a Greek alliance against the Persians at the
Battle of Plataea
.
Ancient Sparta.
The decisive Greek victory at Plataea put an end to the
Greco-Persian War
along with Persian ambitions to expand into Europe. Even though this war was won by a pan-Greek army, credit was given to Sparta, who besides providing the leading forces at Thermopylae and Plataea, had been the de facto leader of the entire Greek expedition.
[48]
In later Classical times, Sparta along with
Athens
,
Thebes
, and
Persia
were the main powers fighting for supremacy in the northeastern Mediterranean. In the course of the
Peloponnesian War
, Sparta, a traditional land power, acquired a navy which managed to overpower the previously dominant flotilla of Athens, ending the
Athenian Empire
. At the peak of its power in the early 4th century BC, Sparta had subdued many of the main Greek states and even invaded the Persian provinces in Anatolia (modern day Turkey), a period known as the
Spartan hegemony
.
During the
Corinthian War
, Sparta faced a coalition of the leading Greek states:
Thebes
,
Athens
,
Corinth
, and
Argos
. The alliance was initially backed by Persia, which feared further Spartan expansion into Asia.
[49]
Sparta achieved a series of land victories, but many of her ships were destroyed at the
Battle of Cnidus
by a Greek-Phoenician mercenary fleet that Persia had provided to Athens. The event severely damaged Sparta's naval power but did not end its aspirations of invading further into Persia, until
Conon
the Athenian ravaged the Spartan coastline and provoked the old Spartan fear of a
helot
revolt.
[50]
After a few more years of fighting, in 387 BC the
Peace of Antalcidas
was established, according to which all Greek cities of
Ionia
would return to Persian control, and Persia's Asian border would be free of the Spartan threat.
[50]
The effects of the war were to reaffirm Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's weakened hegemonic position in the Greek political system.
[51]
Sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to
Epaminondas
of Thebes at the
Battle of Leuctra
. This was the first time that a full strength
Spartan army
lost a land battle.
As Spartan citizenship was inherited by blood, Sparta increasingly faced a helot population that vastly outnumbered its citizens. The alarming decline of Spartan citizens was commented on by
Aristotle
.
Hellenistic and Roman Sparta
Medieval depiction of Sparta from the
Nuremberg Chronicle
(1493)
Sparta never fully recovered from its losses at Leuctra in 371 BC and the subsequent
helot revolts
. In 338,
Philip II
invaded and devastated much of Laconia, turning the Spartans out, though he did not seize Sparta itself.
[52]
Even during its decline, Sparta never forgot its claim to be the "defender of Hellenism" and its
Laconic wit
. An anecdote has it that when Philip II sent a message to Sparta saying "If I invade Laconia, I shall turn you out."
[53]
, the Spartans responded with the single, terse reply:
αἴκα
, "if".
[54]
[55]
[56]
When Philip created the
League of Corinth
on the pretext of unifying Greece against Persia, the Spartans chose not to join, since they had no interest in joining a pan-Greek expedition unless it were under Spartan leadership. Thus, upon defeating the Persians at the
Battle of the Granicus
, Alexander the Great sent to Athens 300 suits of Persian armour with the following inscription: "Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Spartans, give these offerings taken from the foreigners who live in Asia".
Sparta continued to be one of the Peloponesian powers until its eventual loss of independence in 192 BC. During Alexander's campaigns in the east, the Spartan king
Agis III
sent a force to Crete in 333 BC to secure the island for the Persian interest.
[57]
[58]
Agis next took command of allied Greek forces against Macedon, gaining early successes, before laying siege to
Megalopolis
in 331 BC. A large
Macedonian army
under general
Antipater
marched to its relief and defeated the Spartan-led force in a pitched battle.
[59]
More than 5,300 of the Spartans and their allies were killed in battle, and 3,500 of Antipater's troops.
[60]
Agis, now wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing Macedonian army so that he could buy them time to retreat. On his knees, the Spartan king slew several enemy soldiers before being finally killed by a javelin.
[61]
Alexander was merciful, and he only forced the Spartans to join the League of Corinth, which they had previously refused.
[62]
During the
Punic Wars
, Sparta was an ally of the
Roman Republic
. Spartan political independence was put to an end when it was eventually forced into the
Achaean League
after its defeat in the decisive
Laconian War
by a coalition of other Greek city-states and Rome, and the resultant overthrow of its final king
Nabis
, in 192 BC. Sparta played no active part in the
Achaean War
in 146 BC when the Achaean League was defeated by the Roman general
Lucius Mummius
. Subsequently, Sparta became a
free city
under Roman rule, some of the institutions of
Lycurgus
were restored,
[63]
and the city became a tourist attraction for the Roman elite who came to observe exotic Spartan customs.
[n 3]
In 214 AD,
Roman emperor
Caracalla
, in his preparation for
his campaign
against
Parthia
, recruited a 500-man Spartan
cohort
(
lokhos
).
Herodian
described this unit as a
phalanx
, implying it fought like the old Spartans as hoplites, or even as a
Macedonian phalanx
. Despite this, a gravestone of a fallen legionary named Marcus Aurelius Alexys shows him lightly armed, with a
pilos-like
cap and a wooden club. The unit was presumably discharged in 217 after Caracalla was assassinated.
[68]
An exchange of letters in the
deutero-canonical
First Book of Maccabees
expresses a
Jewish
claim to kinship with the Spartans:
Areus king of the Lacedemonians to
Onias
the high priest, greeting: It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are of the stock of
Abraham
: Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shall do well to write unto us of your prosperity. We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are ours, and ours are yours.
—
Authorized King James Version
1 Maccabees 12.20
The letters are reproduced in a variant form by
Josephus
.
[69]
Jewish historian Uriel Rappaport notes that the relationship between the Jews and the Spartans expressed in this correspondence has "intrigued many scholars, and various explanations have been suggested for the problems raised ... including the historicity of the Jewish leader and
high priest
Jonathan
's letter to the Spartans, the authenticity of the letter of Arius to Onias, cited in Jonathan's letter, and the supposed 'brotherhood' of the Jews and the Spartans." Rappaport is clear that "the authenticity of [the reply] letter of Arius is based on even less firm foundations than the letter of Jonathan".
[70]
Spartans long spurned the idea of building a
defensive wall
around their city, believing they made the city's men soft in terms of their warrior abilities. A wall was finally erected after 184 BCE, after the peak of the city-state's power had come and gone.
[71]
Postclassical and modern Sparta
In 396 AD, Sparta was sacked by
Visigoths
under
Alaric I
who sold inhabitants into slavery.
[72]
[73]
According to Byzantine sources,
some parts
of the Laconian region remained
pagan
until well into the 10th century. The
Tsakonian language
still spoken in
Tsakonia
is the only surviving descendant of the ancient
Doric language
.
[74]
In the Middle Ages, the political and cultural center of Laconia shifted to the nearby settlement of
Mystras
, and Sparta fell further in even local importance.  Modern
Sparta
was re-founded in 1834, by a decree of King
Otto of Greece
.
Structure of Classical Spartan society
Constitution
Main article:
Spartan Constitution
Structure of the Spartan Constitution
Sparta was an
oligarchy
. The state was ruled by two
hereditary kings
of the
Agiad and Eurypontid
families
,
[75]
both supposedly descendants of
Heracles
and equal in authority, so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague.
[28]
The duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and military. As chief priests of the state, they maintained communication with the Delphian sanctuary, whose pronouncements exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus c. 450 BC, their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses, adoptions and the public roads.
Aristotle
describes the kingship at Sparta as "a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship" (Pol. iii. 1285a), while
Isocrates
refers to the Spartans as "subject to an oligarchy at home, to a kingship on campaign" (iii. 24).
[28]
Civil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the
ephors
, as well as a council of
elders
known as the
Gerousia
.  The Gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings.
[76]
High state decisions were discussed by this council, who could then propose policies to the
damos
, the collective body of Spartan citizenry, who would
select one of the alternatives by vote
.
[77]
[78]
Royal prerogatives were curtailed over time. From the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to
declare war
and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted by the ephors also in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Political power was transferred to the ephors and Gerousia.
[28]
An assembly of citizens called the
Ekklesia
was responsible for electing men to the Gerousia for life.
Citizenship
Main article:
Spartiate
The Spartan education process known as the
agoge
was essential for full citizenship. However, usually the only boys eligible for the
agoge
were
Spartiates
, those who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city.
There were two exceptions.
trophimoi
or "foster sons" were foreign students invited to study. The Athenian general
Xenophon
, for example, sent his two sons to Sparta as trophimoi. Also, the son of a helot could be enrolled as a
syntrophos
[79]
if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way; if he did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate.
[80]
Spartans who could not afford to pay the expenses of the
agoge
could lose their citizenship.
These laws meant that Sparta could not readily replace citizens lost in battle or otherwise, which eventually proved near fatal as citizens became greatly outnumbered by non-citizens, and even more dangerously by helots.
Non citizens
The other classes were the
perioikoi
, free inhabitants who were non-citizens, and the
helots
,
[81]
state-owned
serfs
. Descendants of non-Spartan citizens were forbidden the
agoge
.
Helots
Main article:
Helots
The Spartans were a minority of the Lakonian population.  The largest class of inhabitants were the helots (in
Classical Greek
Εἵλωτες
/
Heílôtes
).
[82]
[83]
The helots were originally free Greeks from the areas of
Messenia
and
Lakonia
whom the Spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaved.
[84]
In contrast to populations conquered by other Greek cities (e.g. the Athenian treatment of Melos), the male population was not exterminated and the women and children turned into chattel slaves. Instead, the helots were given a subordinate position in society more comparable to serfs in medieval Europe than chattel slaves in the rest of Greece.
[

]
The Spartan helots were not only agricultural workers, but were also household servants, both male and female would be assigned domestic duties, such as wool-working.
[85]
However, the helots were not the private property of individual Spartan citizens, regardless of their household duties, and were instead owned by the state through the
kleros
system.
[86]
Helots did not have voting or political rights. The Spartan poet
Tyrtaios
refers to Helots being allowed to marry and retaining 50% of the fruits of their labor.
[87]
They also seem to have been allowed to practice religious rites and, according to Thucydides, own a limited amount of personal property.
[88]
Initially, helots couldn't be freed but during the middle
Hellenistic period
, some 6,000 helots accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom, for example, in 227 BC.
In other Greek city-states, free citizens were part-time soldiers who, when not at war, carried on other trades.  Since Spartan men were full-time soldiers, they were not available to carry out manual labour.
[89]
The helots were used as unskilled
serfs
, tilling Spartan land.  Helot women were often used as
wet nurses
.  Helots also travelled with the Spartan army as non-combatant serfs.  At the last stand of the
Battle of Thermopylae
, the Greek dead included not just the legendary three hundred Spartan soldiers but also several hundred
Thespian
and
Theban
troops and a number of helots.
[90]
There was at least one helot revolt (c. 465-460 BC) that led to prolonged conflict. By the tenth year of this war the Spartans and Messenians had reached an agreement in which Messenian rebels were allowed to leave the Peloponnese.
[91]
They were given safe passage under the terms that they would be re-enslaved if they tried to return. This agreement ended the most serious incursion into Spartan territory since their expansion in the seventh and eighth centuries BC.
[92]
Thucydides remarked that "Spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots."
[93]
[94]
On the other hand, the Spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 BC to take a force of 35,000 with them to Plataea, something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away. Slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the Greek world, and in 413 BC 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to join the Spartan forces occupying Attica.
[95]
What made Sparta's relations with her slave population unique was that the helots, precisely because they enjoyed privileges such as family and property, retained their identity as a conquered people (the Messenians) and also had effective kinship groups that could be used to organize rebellion.
[
citation needed
]
As the Spartiate population declined and the helot population continued to grow, the imbalance of power caused increasing tension. According to
Myron of Priene
[96]
of the middle 3rd century BC:
They assign to the Helots every shameful task leading to disgrace. For they ordained that each one of them must wear a dogskin cap (
κυνῆ
/
kunễ
) and wrap himself in skins (
διφθέρα
/
diphthéra
) and receive a stipulated number of beatings every year regardless of any wrongdoing, so that they would never forget they were slaves. Moreover, if any exceeded the vigour proper to a slave's condition, they made death the penalty; and they allotted a punishment to those controlling them if they failed to rebuke those who were growing fat.
[97]
Plutarch also states that Spartans treated the helots "harshly and cruelly": they compelled them to drink pure wine (which was considered dangerous -
wine
usually being cut with water) "...and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs..." during
syssitia
(obligatory banquets).
[98]
Each year when the Ephors took office, they ritually declared war on the helots, allowing Spartans to kill them without risk of ritual pollution.
[99]
This fight seems to have been carried out by
kryptai
(sing. κρύπτης
kryptēs
), graduates of the
agoge
who took part in the mysterious institution known as the
Krypteia
.
[100]
Thucydides states:
The helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against the enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the object being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel. As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, and no one ever knew how each of them perished.
[101]
[102]
Perioikoi
Main article:
Perioeci
The Perioikoi came from similar origins as the helots but occupied a significantly different position in Spartan society.  Although they did not enjoy full citizen-rights, they were free and not subjected to the same restrictions as the helots.  The exact nature of their subjection to the Spartans is not clear, but they seem to have served partly as a kind of military reserve, partly as skilled craftsmen and partly as agents of foreign trade.
[103]
Perioikoic hoplites served increasingly with the Spartan army, explicitly at the
Battle of Plataea
, and although they may also have fulfilled functions such as the manufacture and repair of armour and weapons,
[104]
they were increasingly integrated into the combat units of the Spartan army as the Spartiate population declined.
[105]
Economy
Name vase

Rider Painter
(Laconian
black-figured
kylix
, c. 550-530 BC)
Full citizen Spartiates were barred by law from trade or manufacture, which consequently rested in the hands of the Perioikoi.
[28]
This lucrative monopoly, in a fertile territory with a good harbors, ensured the loyalty of the perioikoi.
[106]
Despite the prohibition on menial labor or trade, there is evidence of Spartan sculptors,
[107]
and Spartans were certainly poets, magistrates, ambassadors, and governors as well as soldiers.
Allegedly, Spartans were prohibited from possessing gold and silver coins, and according to legend Spartan currency consisted of iron bars to discourage hoarding.
[108]
[109]
It was not until the 260s or 250s BC that Sparta began to mint its own coins.
[110]
Though the conspicuous display of wealth appears to have been discouraged, this did not preclude the production of very fine decorated bronze, ivory and wooden works of art as well as exquisite jewellery, attested in archaeology.
[111]
Allegedly as part of the Lycurgan Reforms in the mid-8th century BC, a massive
land reform
had divided property into 9,000 equal portions. Each citizen received one estate, a
kleros
, which was expected to provide his living.
[112]
The land was worked by helots who retained half the yield. From the other half, the Spartiate was expected to pay his mess (
syssitia
) fees, and the
agoge
fees for his children. However, nothing is known of matters of wealth such as how land was bought, sold, and inherited, or whether daughters received dowries.
[113]
However, from early on there were marked differences of wealth within the state, and these became more serious after the law of
Epitadeus
some time after the
Peloponnesian War
, which removed the legal prohibition on the gift or bequest of land.
[28]
[114]
By the mid-5th century, land had become concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite, and the notion that all Spartan citizens were equals had become an empty pretence. By Aristotle's day (384-322 BC) citizenship had been reduced from 9,000 to less than 1,000, then further decreased to 700 at the accession of
Agis IV
in 244 BC. Attempts were made to remedy this by imposing legal penalties upon bachelors,
[28]
but this could not reverse the trend.
Life in Classical Sparta
Jean-Pierre Saint-Ours
,
The Selection of Children in Sparta
, 1785. A
Neoclassical
imaging of what
Plutarch
describes.
Birth and death
Sparta was above all a militarist state, and emphasis on military fitness began virtually at birth. According to Plutarch after birth, a mother would bathe her child in wine to see whether the child was strong. If the child survived it was brought before the Gerousia by the child's father. The Gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not.
[28]
It is commonly stated that if they considered it "puny and deformed", the baby was thrown into a chasm on
Mount Taygetos
known euphemistically as the
Apothetae
(Gr.,
ἀποθέται
, "Deposits").
[115]
[116]
This was, in effect, a primitive form of
eugenics
.
[115]
Plutarch is the sole historical source for the Spartan practice of systemic infanticide motivated by eugenics.
[117]
Sparta is often viewed as being unique in this regard, however, anthropologist Laila Williamson notes: "Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule."
[118]
There is controversy about the matter in Sparta, since excavations in the chasm only uncovered adult remains, likely belonging to criminals
[119]
and Greek sources contemporary to Sparta does not mention systemic infanticide motivated solely by eugenics.
[120]
Spartan burial customs changed over time. The Archaic Spartan poet
Tyrtaeus
spoke of the Spartan war-dead as follows:
Never do his [the war-dead's] name and good fame perish,
But even though he is beneath the earth he is immortal,
Young and old alike mourn him,
All the city is distressed by the painful loss,
and his tomb and children are pointed out among the people,
and his children’s children and his line after them.
[121]
When Spartans died, marked headstones would only be granted to soldiers who died in combat during a victorious campaign or women who died either in service of a divine office or in childbirth.
[122]
These headstones likely acted as memorials, rather than as grave markers. Evidence of Spartan burials is provided by the Tomb of the Lacedaimonians in Athens.

Excavations at the cemetery of classical Sparta, uncovered ritually pierced
kantharoid
-like ceramic vessels, the ritual slaughter of horses, and specific burial enclosures alongside individual 'plots'. Some of the graves were reused over time.
[123]
[124]
In the Hellenistic Period, grander, two-storey monumental tombs are found at Sparta. Ten of these have been found for this period.
[124]
Education
Main article:
Agoge
Bronze appliqué of Spartan manufacture, possibly depicting
Orestes
, 550-525 BC (
Getty Villa
)
When male Spartans began military training at age seven, they would enter the
agoge
system. The
agoge
was designed to encourage discipline and physical toughness and to emphasize the importance of the Spartan state. Boys lived in communal
messes
and, according to Xenophon, whose sons attended the
agoge
, the boys were fed "just the right amount for them never to become sluggish through being too full, while also giving them a taste of what it is not to have enough."
[125]
In addition, they were trained to survive in times of privation, even if it meant stealing.
[126]
Besides physical and weapons training, boys studied reading, writing, music and dancing. Special punishments were imposed if boys failed to answer questions sufficiently "
laconically
" (i.e. briefly and wittily).
[127]
Spartan boys were expected to take an older male mentor, usually an unmarried young man. According to some sources, the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of
Spartan pederasty
is not entirely clear). Xenophon, an admirer of the Spartan educational system whose sons attended the
agoge
, explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.
[128]
[125]
Some Spartan youth apparently became members of an irregular unit known as the
Krypteia
. The immediate objective of this unit was to seek out and kill vulnerable helot Laconians as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population.
[129]
Less information is available about the education of Spartan girls, but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle, broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training. Spartan girls received an education known as
mousikē
. This included music, dancing, singing and poetry. Choral dancing was taught so Spartan girls could participate in ritual activities, including the cults of Helen and Artemis.
[130]
In this respect, classical Sparta was unique in ancient Greece. In no other city-state did women receive any kind of formal education.
[131]
Military life
Main articles:
Spartan army
and
Spartiate
The so-called
Leonidas
sculpture (5th century BC),
Archaeological Museum of Sparta
, Greece
At age 20, the Spartan citizen began his membership in one of the
syssitia
(dining messes or clubs), composed of about fifteen members each, of which every citizen was required to be a member.
[28]
Here each group learned how to bond and rely on one another. The Spartans were not eligible for election for public office until the age of 30. Only native Spartans were considered full citizens and were obliged to undergo the training as prescribed by law, as well as participate in and contribute financially to one of the
syssitia
.
[132]
Sparta is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and some scholars claim that it was also the first to formalize pederasty.
[133]
According to these sources, the Spartans believed that the love of an older, accomplished aristocrat for an adolescent was essential to his formation as a free citizen. The
agoge
, the education of the ruling class, was, they claim, founded on pederastic relationships required of each citizen,
[134]
with the lover responsible for the boy's training.
However, other scholars question this interpretation. Xenophon explicitly denies it,
[125]
but not Plutarch.
[135]
Spartan men remained in the active reserve until age 60.  Men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30.  They called themselves "
homoioi
" (equals), pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the
phalanx
, which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades.
[136]
Insofar as
hoplite
warfare could be perfected, the Spartans did so.
[137]
Thucydides reports that when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or another woman of some significance) would customarily present him with his
shield
(shield) and say: "With this, or upon this" (Ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς,
Èi tàn èi èpì tàs
), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it).
[138]
This is almost certainly propaganda.  Spartans buried their battle dead on or near the battle field; corpses were not brought back on their shield.
[139]
Nevertheless, it is fair to say that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet, breastplate or
greaves
than his shield, since the former were designed to protect one man, whereas the shield also protected the man on his left. Thus, the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier's subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms - messmates and friends, often close blood relations.
According to Aristotle, the Spartan military culture was actually short-sighted and ineffective. He observed:
It is the standards of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind, for it is good men not beasts who are capable of real courage. Those like the Spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of city's life, end up making them inferior even in that.
[140]
One of the most persistent myths about Sparta that has no basis in fact is the notion that Spartan mothers were without feelings toward their off-spring and helped enforce a militaristic lifestyle on their sons and husbands.
[142]
The myth can be traced back to Plutarch, who includes no less than 17 "sayings" of "Spartan women", all of which paraphrase or elaborate on the theme that Spartan mothers rejected their own offspring if they showed any kind of cowardice. In some of these sayings, mothers revile their sons in insulting language merely for surviving a battle. These sayings purporting to be from Spartan women were far more likely to be of Athenian origin and designed to portray Spartan women as unnatural and so undeserving of pity.
[139]
Agriculture, food, and diet
Sparta's agriculture consisted mainly of barley, wine, cheese, grain, and figs. These items were grown locally on each Spartan citizen's kleros and were tended to by helots. Spartan citizens were required to donate a certain amount of what they yielded from their kleros to their syssitia, or mess. These donations to the syssitia were a requirement for every Spartan citizen. All the donated food was then redistributed to feed the Spartan population of that syssitia.
[143]
The helots who tended to the lands were fed using a portion of what they harvested.
[144]
Marriage
Plutarch reports the peculiar customs associated with the Spartan wedding night:
The custom was to capture women for marriage... The so-called 'bridesmaid' took charge of the captured girl.  She first shaved her head to the scalp, then dressed her in a man's cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark.  The bridegroom - who was not drunk and thus not impotent, but was sober as always - first had dinner in the messes, then would slip in, undo her belt, lift her and carry her to the bed.
[145]
The husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage.  These customs, unique to the Spartans, have been interpreted in various ways.  One of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage, so unaccustomed were men to women's looks at the time of their first intercourse. The "abduction" may have served to ward off the
evil eye
, and the cutting of the wife's hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life.
[146]
Role of women
Main article:
Women in ancient Sparta
Political, social, and economic equality
Spartan women, of the citizenry class, enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. The higher status of females in Spartan society started at birth; unlike Athens, Spartan girls were fed the same food as their brothers.
[147]
Nor were they confined to their father's house and prevented from exercising or getting fresh air as in Athens, but exercised and even competed in sports.
[147]
Most important, rather than being married off at the age of 12 or 13, Spartan law forbade the marriage of a girl until she was in her late teens or early 20s. The reasons for delaying marriage were to ensure the birth of healthy children, but the effect was to spare Spartan women the hazards and lasting health damage associated with
pregnancy among adolescents
.  Spartan women, better fed from childhood and fit from exercise, stood a far better chance of reaching old age than their sisters in other Greek cities, where the median age for death was 34.6 years or roughly 10 years below that of men.
Unlike
Athenian women
who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore dresses (
peplos
) slit up the side to allow freer movement and moved freely about the city, either walking or driving chariots. Girls as well as boys exercised, possibly in the nude, and young women as well as young men may have participated in the
Gymnopaedia
("Festival of Nude Youths").
[149]
[150]
Another practice that was mentioned by many visitors to Sparta was the practice of "wife-sharing".  In accordance with the Spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents, many older men allowed younger, more fit men, to impregnate their wives.  Other unmarried or childless men might even request another man's wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer.
[151]
For this reason many considered Spartan women
polygamous
or
polyandrous
.
[152]
This practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could. The Spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss of the men in battle and the intense physical inspection of newborns.
[153]
Spartan women were also literate and numerate, a rarity in the ancient world. Furthermore, as a result of their education and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with their fellow (male) citizens, they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public.
[154]
Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women's curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato praised Spartan women's ability when it came to philosophical discussion.
[155]
Most importantly, Spartan women had economic power because they controlled their own properties, and those of their husbands. It is estimated that in later Classical Sparta, when the male population was in serious decline, women were the sole owners of at least 35% of all land and property in Sparta.
[156]
The laws regarding a divorce were the same for both men and women. Unlike women in Athens, if a Spartan woman became the heiress of her father because she had no living brothers to inherit (an
epikleros
), the woman was not required to divorce her current spouse in order to marry her nearest paternal relative.
[156]
Historic women
Many women played a significant role in the
history of Sparta
.
[157]
Queen Gorgo
, heiress to the throne and the wife of
Leonidas I
, was an influential and well-documented figure.  Herodotus records that as a small girl she advised her father
Cleomenes
to resist a bribe. She was later said to be responsible for decoding a warning that the Persian forces were about to invade Greece; after Spartan generals could not decode a wooden tablet covered in wax, she ordered them to clear the wax, revealing the warning.
[158]
Plutarch's
Moralia
contains a collection of "Sayings of Spartan Women", including a laconic quip attributed to Gorgo: when asked by a woman from
Attica
why Spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men, she replied "Because we are the only women who are mothers of men".
[159]
In 396,
Cynisca
, sister of the Eurypontid king Agesilaos II, became the first woman in Greece to win an Olympic chariot race. She won again in 392, and dedicated two monuments to commemorate her victory, these being an inscription in Sparta and a set of bronze equestrian statues at the Olympic temple of Zeus.
[160]
[161]
Laconophilia
Main article:
Laconophilia
Laconophilia is love or admiration of Sparta and its culture or constitution. Sparta was subject of considerable admiration in its day, even in rival
Athens
.  In ancient times "Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians always considered the Spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice."
[162]
Many Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, would often describe Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money. The French classicist
François Ollier
in his 1933 book
Le mirage spartiate
(The Spartan Mirage) warned that a major scholarly problem is that all surviving accounts of Sparta were by non-Spartans who often excessively idealized their subject.
[163]
No accounts survive by the Spartans themselves, if such were ever written.
Young Spartans Exercising
by
Edgar Degas
(1834-1917)
With the revival of classical learning in
Renaissance Europe
, Laconophilia re-appeared, for example in the writings of
Machiavelli
. The Elizabethan English constitutionalist
John Aylmer
compared the mixed government of
Tudor England
to the Spartan republic, stating that "Lacedemonia [was] the noblest and best city governed that ever was". He commended it as a model for England. The philosopher
Jean-Jacques Rousseau
contrasted Sparta favourably with Athens in his
Discourse on the Arts and Sciences
, arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more sophisticated Athenian life. Sparta was also used as a model of austere purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France.
[164]
A German
racist
strain of Laconophilia was initiated by
Karl Otfried Müller
, who linked Spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the Dorians, the ethnic sub-group of the Greeks to which the Spartans belonged. In the 20th century, this developed into
Fascist
admiration of Spartan ideals.
Adolf Hitler
praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting "the number allowed to live". He added that "The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans." The Spartans had created "the first racialist state".
[165]
Following
the invasion of the
USSR
, Hitler viewed citizens of the USSR as like the helots under the Spartans: "They [the Spartans] came as conquerors, and they took everything", and so should the Germans. A Nazi officer specified that "the Germans would have to assume the position of the Spartiates, while... the Russians were the Helots."
[165]
Certain early Zionists, and particularly the founders of
Kibbutz
movement in Israel, were influenced by Spartan ideals, particularly in education.
Tabenkin
, a founding father of the Kibbutz movement and the
Palmach
strikeforce, prescribed that education for warfare "should begin from the nursery", that children should from kindergarten be taken to "spend nights in the mountains and valleys".
[166]
[167]
In modern times, the adjective "Spartan" means simple, frugal, avoiding luxury and comfort.
[168]
The term "
laconic phrase
" describes the very terse and direct speech characteristic of the Spartans.
Sparta also features prominently in modern
popular culture
, most famously the
Battle of Thermopylae
(see
Battle of Thermopylae in popular culture
).

In chemistry and physics,
LIESST (Light-Induced Excited Spin-State Trapping)
is a method of changing the electronic spin state of a compound by means of irradiation with light.

are capable of

(and d

when molecular symmetry is lower than O

).
[2]
Spin crossover refers to where a transition from the high spin (HS) state to the low spin (LS) state or vice versa occurs. Alternatives to LIESST include using thermal changes and pressure to induce spin crossover. The metal most commonly exhibiting spin crossover is iron, with the first known example, an iron(III) tris(dithiocarbamato) complex, reported by Cambi
[3]
et al. in 1931.
For iron complexes, LIESST involves excitation of the low spin complex with green light to a triplet state. Two successive steps of
intersystem crossing
result in the high spin complex. Movement from the high spin complex to the low spin complex requires excitation with red light.

Port of Bundaberg
is located at
Burnett Heads
, 20 kilometres (12 mi) northeast of the city of
Bundaberg
, 5.6 nautical miles from the mouth of the
Burnett River
in
Queensland
, Australia. The port is a destination for ships from Australia and overseas. It is predominantly used for out shipping raw sugar, other goods related to that industry such as
Bundaberg Rum
and
molasses
and importing
Gypsum
to supply a
Knauf
factory situated adjacent.
[3]
[4]
Bundaberg Port is wholly owned and managed by the
Gladstone Ports Corporation
.
Bulk raw sugar can be stored in two large sheds which are loaded via a travelling gantry loader.
[5]
Bulk molasses is stored in three tanks and are loaded via a pipeline.
[5]
Ship size is limited to 200 m in
length overall
.
[5]
There are two berths.
History
[
edit
]
Schooners at the first upriver port, 1894
Port facilities began in the town reach of the Burnett River.  This site became unsuitable for larger bulk ships. The port moved to the mouth of the river and was opened in 1958.
[6]
In late December 2010, the port was closed due to the flooding of the Burnett River during the
2010-2011 Queensland floods
.
[7]
Emergency dredging occurred the following February to re-open the port,
[8]
which was opened on 4 March 2011.

"
San Tropez
" is the fourth track from the album
Meddle
by the band
Pink Floyd
.
[2]
[3]
This song was one of several to be considered for the band's "best of" album,
Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd
.
[4]
Writing
[
edit
]
Unlike the other tracks on
Meddle
, "San Tropez" was not written collaboratively; instead, Roger Waters wrote the piece himself and brought it into the studio already finished. It is the only track on
Meddle
not co-written by David Gilmour. This song is about a place called
Saint-Tropez
, a commune of the Var département in southern France located on the French Riviera. The song reflects an idealised vision of what a day in Saint-Tropez might be like.
[5]
Misunderstood lyric
[
edit
]
Throughout the 1970s and beyond, the second-to-last line of lyrics to the song, "Making a date for later by phone", has been persistently misunderstood in Italy, mainly because of Waters' slurred pronunciation ("...fer-lita-pah-fon"), as being "Making a date for
Rita Pavone
", with a reference to the well-known 1960s Italian pop singer.
[
citation needed
]
Pavone herself has stated several times, in TV interviews and elsewhere, that she actually believes the line to be about her.
[6]
Recording
[
edit
]
While Roger Waters plays the acoustic guitar as well as his usual
bass
, "San Tropez" does include a short
slide guitar
solo from guitarist
David Gilmour
and an extended piano solo by keyboardist
Richard Wright
at the end.
Reception
[
edit
]
In a review for the
Meddle
album, Jean-Charles Costa of
Rolling Stone
described "San Tropez", along with "
A Pillow of Winds
", as an "ozone ballad". He further described the two as "pleasant little acoustic numbers hovering over a bizarre back-drop of weird sounds."
[7]
Classic Rock Review
described "San Tropez" as "a
jazz
-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo."
[8]
They went on further saying "[San Tropez] adds another diverse dimension to the album with its easy-going crooner-like melody and atmosphere."

History
[
edit
]
Entrance to McFerren Park, 2007
Hoopeston was laid out in 1871. It was named for Thomas Hoopes, one of the men who offered land for the crossing of two railroads:  the Lafayette, Bloomington and Western Railroad and the
Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad
.
[4]
[5]
The two railroads separated the town into four sections.  The latter railroad still exists and is now operated jointly by
CSX Transportation
and
Union Pacific Railroad
.
[6]
In 1890, Greer College was established in Hoopeston, funded by a gift of $40,000 and 500 acres (2.0 km
2
) of land from John Greer.
[5]
Business and manufacturing in Hoopeston have historically been related to agriculture. In 1875, S. S. McCall established the Illinois Canning Company to can locally grown vegetables, and this was so successful that in 1878 the Hoopeston Canning Company was established, which later became part of Stokely-Van Camp, Inc.
[5]
In addition,
Silgan Can
(formerly American Can) had a factory which manufactured the
tin cans
themselves, and an
FMC
plant manufactured agricultural machinery. There was also an engine company there until at least 1915, the
Hoopeston Gas Engine Company
, which catered to agriculture and home use.  Hoopeston was also the location of one of several prisoner of war camps housing
German
soldiers during
World War II
(see
German Prisoner of War Camp, Hoopeston, Illinois
); many POWs picked crops for the canneries.
In honor of its agricultural roots, including the growing of
sweet corn
, Hoopeston holds a Sweet Corn Festival each September, starting the Thursday before
Labor Day
and ending on Labor Day.  In association with the festival, the
Miss National Sweetheart
is held during the same week.  Runners-up from the Miss America state pageants are eligible to compete for the title of Miss National Sweetheart.
Hoopeston is now surrounded by many
wind turbines
that have been organized into computerized
wind farms
.
[7]
Geography
[
edit
]
Hoopeston is located at the intersection of
Illinois Route 1
and
Illinois Route 9
, about one mile from the north edge of Vermilion County. According to the 2010 census, Hoopeston has a total area of 3.69 square miles (9.56 km
2
), all land.

Winning this title does not guarantee that a contestant will win a Miss America state title, but since 1980, five Miss National Sweetheart winners have gone on to win both their state and the Miss America title.
[17]
Since 1970 there have been nine Miss America titleholders who have competed in the National Sweetheart pageant.
[18]
In 2016, the Miss America organization officially disassociated itself with the Miss National Sweetheart Organization. Pursuant to their decision, Miss America state pageant contestants are prohibited from competing for Miss National Sweetheart.

Himalayan expedition
Nanga Parbat
Willy Merkl, leader of the expedition
The
1934 Nanga Parbat climbing disaster
resulted in the loss of 10 lives on
Nanga Parbat
, the world's
ninth-highest mountain
[1]
and one of the 14
eight-thousanders
.
[2]
The disaster, which happened during the 1934 climbing season, included nine climbers who died in what was, at the time, the single deadliest mountaineering accident in history.
Event
[
edit
]
In 1934, German climber
Willy Merkl
led a well financed expedition to Nanga Parbat (located in
Jammu and Kashmir
,
British India
; present-day
Gilgit-Baltistan
, northeastern
Pakistan
),
[3]
with the full backing of the new
Nazi
government
. Early in the expedition Alfred Drexel died, probably of
high altitude pulmonary edema
.
[4]
The
Tyrolean
climbers
Peter Aschenbrenner
[
de
]
and
Erwin Schneider
[
de
]
reached an estimated height of (7,895 m / 25,900 ft) on July 6, but were forced to return because of worsening weather. On July 7, they and 14 others were trapped by a ferocious storm at 7,480 m (24,540 ft). During the desperate retreat that followed, three famous German mountaineers,
Ulrich Wieland
[
de
]
,
Willo Welzenbach
[
de
]
and Merkl himself, as well as six
Sherpas
, died of exhaustion, exposure and altitude sickness, and several more suffered severe
frostbite
. The last survivor to reach safety,
Ang Tsering
, did so having spent seven days battling through the storm.
[5]
It has been said that the disaster, "for sheer protracted agony, has no parallel in climbing annals."
[6]
Books
[
edit
]
Jonathan Neale wrote a book about the 1934 climbing season on Nanga Parbat called
Tigers of the Snow
. He interviewed many old Sherpas, including Ang Tsering, the last man off Nanga Parbat alive in 1934. The book attempts to narrate what went wrong on the expedition, set against mountaineering history of the early twentieth century, the background of German politics in the 1930s, and the hardship and passion of life in the Sherpa valleys.

The
Ottoman Empire
,
[k]
historically and colloquially known as the
Turkish Empire
,
[26]
was an empire
[l]
that controlled much of
Southeast Europe
,
West Asia
, and
North Africa
between the 14th and early 20th centuries. The empire also controlled
a southeastern region
of
Central Europe
from the 16th to the late 17th century.
[27]
The empire was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern
Anatolia
in the town of
Söğüt
(modern-day
Bilecik Province
) by the
Turkoman
[28]
tribal leader
Osman I
.
[29]
After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and, with the
conquest
of the
Balkans
, the Ottoman
beylik
was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the
Byzantine Empire
with the
conquest of Constantinople
in 1453 by
Mehmed II
.
[30]
Under the reign of
Suleiman the Magnificent
, the Ottoman Empire marked the peak of its power and prosperity, as well as the highest development of its governmental, social, and economic systems.
[31]
At the beginning of the 17th century, the empire contained
32 provinces
and numerous
vassal states
. Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy over the course of centuries.
[m]
With
Constantinople
(modern-day
Istanbul
) as its capital and control of lands around the
Mediterranean Basin
, the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the
Middle East
and Europe for six centuries.
While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of
decline
following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians.
[33]
The newer academic consensus posits that the empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy, society and military throughout the 17th and for much of the 18th century.
[34]
However, during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768, the Ottoman military system fell behind that of its European rivals, the
Habsburg
and
Russian
empires.
[35]
The Ottomans consequently suffered severe military defeats in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The successful
Greek War of Independence
concluded with the establishment of modern Greece as an independent state, under the
London Protocol (1830)
and
Treaty of Constantinople (1832)
. This and other defeats such as
Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831-1833
)
[36]
[37]
prompted the Ottoman state to initiate a comprehensive process of reform and modernization known as the
Tanzimat
. Thus, over the course of the 19th century, the Ottoman state became vastly more powerful and organized internally, despite suffering further territorial losses, especially in the Balkans, where a number of new states emerged.
[38]
[39]
[40]
The
Committee of Union and Progress
(CUP) established the
Second Constitutional Era
in the
Young Turk Revolution
in 1908, turning the Empire into a constitutional monarchy, which conducted
competitive multi-party elections
. However, after the disastrous
Balkan Wars
, the now radicalized and nationalistic CUP took over the government in the
1913 coup d'état
, creating a one-party regime. The CUP allied the Empire with
Germany
, hoping to escape from the diplomatic isolation which had contributed to its recent territorial losses, and thus joined
World War I
on the side of the
Central Powers
.
[41]
While the Empire was able to largely hold its own during the conflict, it was struggling with internal dissent, especially with the
Arab Revolt
in its Arabian holdings. During this time, the Ottoman government engaged in
genocide
against the
Armenians
,
Assyrians
, and
Greeks
.
[42]
The Empire's defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the
Allied Powers
in the
aftermath of World War I
resulted in
its partitioning
and the loss of its southern territories, which were
divided between the United Kingdom and France
. The successful
Turkish War of Independence
, led by
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
against the occupying Allies, led to the emergence of the
Republic of Turkey
in the Anatolian heartland and the
abolition of the Ottoman monarchy
.

Names of the Ottoman Empire
See also:
Osman I § Name
The word
Ottoman
is a historical
anglicisation
of the name of
Osman I
, the founder of the Empire and of the ruling
House of Osman
(also known as the Ottoman dynasty). Osman's name in turn was the Turkish form of the Arabic name
ʿUthmān
(
عثمان
). In
Ottoman Turkish
, the empire was referred to as
Devlet-i ʿAlīye-yi ʿO
s
mānīye
(
دولت عليه عثمانیه
),
lit.
'
Sublime Ottoman State
'
, or simply
Devlet-i ʿO
s
mānīye
(
دولت عثمانيه‎
),
lit.
'
Ottoman State
'
.
The Turkish word for "Ottoman" (
Osmanlı
) originally referred to the tribal followers of Osman in the fourteenth century. The word subsequently came to be used to refer to the empire's military-administrative elite. In contrast, the term "Turk" (
Türk
) was used to refer to the Anatolian peasant and tribal population and was seen as a disparaging term when applied to urban, educated individuals.
[44]
: 26
[45]
In the
early modern period
, an educated, urban-dwelling Turkish-speaker who was not a member of the military-administrative class would often refer to themself neither as an
Osmanlı
nor as a
Türk
, but rather as a
Rūmī
(
رومى
), or "Roman", meaning an inhabitant of the territory of the former
Byzantine Empire
in the Balkans and Anatolia. The term
Rūmī
was also used to refer to Turkish speakers by the other Muslim peoples of the empire and beyond.
[46]
: 11
As applied to Ottoman Turkish-speakers, this term began to fall out of use at the end of the seventeenth century, and instead the word increasingly became associated with the Greek population of the empire, a meaning that it still bears in Turkey today.
[47]
: 51
In Western Europe, the names Ottoman Empire, Turkish Empire and Turkey were often used interchangeably, with Turkey being increasingly favoured both in formal and informal situations. This dichotomy was officially ended in 1920-1923, when the newly established
Ankara
-based
Turkish government
chose Turkey as the sole official name. At present, most scholarly historians avoid the terms "Turkey", "Turks", and "Turkish" when referring to the Ottomans, due to the empire's multinational character.

As the
Rum Sultanate
declined well into the 13th century,
Anatolia
was divided into a patchwork of independent Turkish principalities known as the
Anatolian Beyliks
. One of these beyliks, in the region of
Bithynia
on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire, was led by the Turkish tribal leader Osman I (
d.
1323/4), a figure of obscure origins from whom the name Ottoman is derived.
[49]
: 444
Osman's early followers consisted both of Turkish tribal groups and Byzantine renegades, with many but not all converts to Islam.
[50]
: 59
[51]
: 127
Osman extended the control of his principality by conquering Byzantine towns along the
Sakarya River
. A Byzantine defeat at the
Battle of Bapheus
in 1302 contributed to Osman's rise as well. It is not well understood how the early Ottomans came to dominate their neighbors, due to the lack of sources surviving from this period. The
Ghaza thesis
popular during the twentieth century credited their success to their rallying of religious warriors to fight for them in the name of
Islam
, but it is no longer generally accepted. No other hypothesis has attracted broad acceptance.

Battle of Nicopolis
in 1396, as depicted in an
Ottoman miniature
from 1523
In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule had begun to extend over Anatolia and the
Balkans
. The earliest conflicts began during the
Byzantine-Ottoman wars
, waged in
Anatolia
in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid-14th century, followed by the
Bulgarian-Ottoman wars
and the
Serbian-Ottoman wars
waged beginning in the mid 14th century. Much of this period was characterised by
Ottoman expansion into the Balkans
. Osman's son,
Orhan
, captured the northwestern Anatolian city of
Bursa
in 1326, making it the new capital of the Ottoman state and supplanting Byzantine control in the region. The important port city of
Thessaloniki
was captured from the
Venetians
in 1387 and sacked. The Ottoman victory in
Kosovo in 1389
effectively marked
the end of Serbian power
in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe.

The
Battle of Nicopolis
for the

Tsardom of Vidin
in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale

of the

As the Turks expanded into the Balkans, the
conquest of Constantinople
became a crucial objective. The Ottomans had already wrested control of nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but the strong defense of Constantinople's strategic position on the
Bosporus
Strait made it difficult to conquer. In 1402, the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the
Turco-Mongol
leader
Timur
, founder of the
Timurid Empire
, invaded Ottoman Anatolia from the east. In the
Battle of Ankara
in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan
Bayezid I
as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The
ensuing civil war
, also known as the
Fetret Devri
, lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when
Mehmed I
emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power.

The Balkan territories lost by the Ottomans after 1402, including Thessaloniki, Macedonia, and Kosovo, were later recovered by
Murad II
between the 1430s and 1450s. On 10 November 1444, Murad repelled the
Crusade of Varna
by defeating the Hungarian, Polish, and
Wallachian
armies under
Władysław III of Poland
(also King of Hungary) and
John Hunyadi
at the
Battle of Varna
, although Albanians under
Skanderbeg
continued to resist. Four years later, John Hunyadi prepared another army of Hungarian and Wallachian forces to attack the Turks, but was again defeated at the
Second Battle of Kosovo
in 1448.

According to modern historiography, there is a direct connection between the fast Ottoman military advance and the consequences of the
Black Death
from the mid-fourteenth century onwards. Byzantine territories, where the initial Ottoman conquests were carried out, were exhausted demographically and militarily due to the plague outbreaks, which facilitated the Ottoman expansion. In addition, the slave hunting — executed at first by
akinci
irregulars expediting before the Ottoman army — was the main economic driving force behind the Ottoman conquest. Some 21st-century authors re-periodize the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans into the
akıncı phase
, which spanned 8 to 13 decades, characterized by continuous slave hunting and destruction, followed by the phase of administrative integration into the Ottoman Empire.

The son of Murad II,
Mehmed the Conqueror
, reorganized both state and military, and on 29 May 1453 conquered
Constantinople
, ending the Byzantine Empire. Mehmed allowed the
Eastern Orthodox Church
to maintain its autonomy and land in exchange for accepting Ottoman authority.
[62]
Due to tension between the states of western Europe and the later Byzantine Empire, the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as preferable to Venetian rule.
[62]
Albanian resistance was a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion on the Italian peninsula.
[63]
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottoman Empire entered a
period of expansion
. The Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective
Sultans
. It also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia.

Selim I established
Ottoman rule in Egypt
by defeating and annexing the
Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt
and created a naval presence on the
Red Sea
. After this Ottoman expansion, competition began between the
Portuguese Empire
and the Ottoman Empire to become the dominant power in the region.
[66]

Suleiman the Magnificent
(1520-1566) captured
Belgrade
in 1521, conquered the southern and central parts of the
Kingdom of Hungary
as part of the
Ottoman-Hungarian Wars
, and, after his historic victory in the
Battle of Mohács
in 1526, he established Ottoman rule in the territory of present-day Hungary (except the western part) and other Central European territories. He then laid
siege to Vienna
in 1529, but failed to take the city.
[67]

In 1532, he made another
attack
on Vienna, but was repulsed in the
siege of Güns

Transylvania
, Wallachia and, intermittently,
Moldavia
, became tributary principalities of the Ottoman Empire. In the east, the Ottoman Turks
took
Baghdad
from the Persians in 1535, gaining control of
Mesopotamia
and naval access to the
Persian Gulf
. In 1555, the
Caucasus
became officially partitioned for the first time between the Safavids and the Ottomans, a
status quo
that would remain until the end of the
Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774)
. By this partitioning of the Caucasus as signed in the
Peace of Amasya
,
Western Armenia
, western
Kurdistan
, and
Western Georgia
(including western
Samtskhe
) fell into Ottoman hands,
[70]
while southern
Dagestan

Eastern Armenia
,

, and
Azerbaijan
remained Persian.

In 1539, a 60,000-strong Ottoman army besieged the
Spanish
garrison of
Castelnuovo
on the
Adriatic coast
; the successful siege cost the Ottomans 8,000 casualties,
[73]
but
Venice
agreed to terms in 1540, surrendering most of its empire in the
Aegean
and the
Morea
.
France
and the Ottoman Empire, united by mutual opposition to
Habsburg
rule, became strong allies. The French conquests of
Nice
(1543) and
Corsica
(1553) occurred as a joint venture between the forces of the French king
Francis I
and Suleiman, and were commanded by the Ottoman admirals
Hayreddin Barbarossa
and
Dragut
.
[74]
A month before the siege of Nice, France supported the Ottomans with an artillery unit during the 1543 Ottoman
conquest of Esztergom
in northern Hungary. After further advances by the Turks, the Habsburg ruler
Ferdinand
officially recognized Ottoman ascendancy in Hungary in 1547.
Suleiman I
died of natural causes in his tent during the
siege of Szigetvár
in 1566.
By the end of
Suleiman
's reign, the Empire spanned approximately 877,888 sq mi (2,273,720 km

In addition, the Empire became a dominant naval force, controlling much of the
Mediterranean Sea
.
[76]
: 61
By this time, the Ottoman Empire was a major part of the European political sphere. The Ottomans became involved in multi-continental religious wars when Spain and Portugal were united under the
Iberian Union
. The Ottomans were holders of the Caliph title, meaning they were the leaders of all Muslims worldwide. The Iberians were leaders of the Christian crusaders, and so the two were locked in a worldwide conflict. There were zones of operations in the Mediterranean Sea
[77]
and
Indian Ocean
,
[78]
where Iberians circumnavigated Africa to reach India and, on their way, wage war upon the Ottomans and their local Muslim allies. Likewise, the Iberians passed through newly-Christianized
Latin America
and
had sent expeditions
that traversed the Pacific in order to Christianize the formerly Muslim Philippines and use it as a base to further attack the Muslims in the
Far East
.
[79]
In this case, the Ottomans sent armies to aid its easternmost vassal and territory, the
Sultanate of Aceh
in Southeast Asia.

During the 1600s, the worldwide conflict between the Ottoman Caliphate and Iberian Union was a stalemate
since both powers were at similar population, technology and economic levels.
Nevertheless, the success of the Ottoman political and military establishment was compared to the
Roman Empire
, despite the difference in the size of their respective territories, by the likes of the contemporary Italian scholar
Francesco Sansovino
and the French political philosopher
Jean Bodin

Ottoman Decline Thesis
In the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East. These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government.
[83]
: 413-414
The empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges, enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful, both militarily and economically.
[33]
[84]
: 10
Historians of the mid-twentieth century once characterised this period as one of stagnation and decline, but this view is now rejected by the majority of academics.
[33]
The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The
Portuguese
discovery of the
Cape of Good Hope
in 1488 initiated
a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars
in the
Indian Ocean
throughout the 16th century. Despite the growing European presence in the Indian Ocean, Ottoman trade with the east continued to flourish. Cairo, in particular, benefitted from the rise of Yemeni coffee as a popular consumer commodity. As coffeehouses appeared in cities and towns across the empire, Cairo developed into a major center for its trade, contributing to its continued prosperity throughout the seventeenth and much of the eighteenth century.
[85]

Under
Ivan IV
(1533-1584), the
Tsardom of Russia
expanded into the Volga and Caspian regions at the expense of the Tatar khanates. In 1571, the Crimean khan
Devlet I Giray
, commanded by the Ottomans,
burned Moscow
.
[86]
The next year, the invasion was repeated but repelled at the
Battle of Molodi
. The Ottoman Empire continued to invade Eastern Europe in a series of
slave raids
,
[87]
and remained a significant power in Eastern Europe until the end of the 17th century.

On 15 September 1570, the Ottoman cavalry appeared before the last Venetian stronghold in Cyprus, Famagusta. The Venetian defenders would hold out for 11 months against a force that would come to number 200,000 men with 145 cannons; 163,000 cannonballs struck the walls of Famagusta before it fell to the Ottomans in August 1571. The
Siege of Famagusta
claimed 50,000 Ottoman casualties.
[90]
: 328
Meanwhile, the
Holy League
consisting of mostly Spanish and Venetian fleets won a victory over the Ottoman fleet at the
Battle of Lepanto
(1571), off southwestern Greece; Catholic forces killed over 30,000 Turks and destroyed 200 of their ships.
[91]
: 24
It was a startling, if mostly symbolic,
[92]
blow to the image of Ottoman invincibility, an image which the victory of the Knights of Malta over the Ottoman invaders in the 1565
siege of Malta
had recently set about eroding.
[93]
The battle was far more damaging to the Ottoman navy in sapping experienced manpower than the loss of ships, which were rapidly replaced.
[94]
: 53
The Ottoman navy recovered quickly, persuading Venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573, allowing the Ottomans to expand and consolidate their position in North Africa.

By contrast, the Habsburg frontier had settled somewhat, a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defenses.
[100]
The
Long Turkish War
against Habsburg Austria (1593-1606) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms, resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy. This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps, which were never fully solved.
[101]
[
obsolete source
]
Irregular sharpshooters (
Sekban
) were also recruited, and on demobilisation turned to
brigandage
in the
Celali rebellions
(1590-1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in
Anatolia
in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
[102]

With the Empire's population reaching 30 million people by 1600, the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government.
[103]
[

In spite of these problems, the Ottoman state remained strong, and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats. The only exceptions were campaigns against the
Safavid dynasty
of Persia, where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost, some permanently. This
1603-1618 war
eventually resulted in the
Treaty of Nasuh Pasha
, which ceded the entire Caucasus, except westernmost Georgia, back into the possession of
Safavid Iran
.
[104]
The treaty ending the
Cretan War
cost Venice much of
Dalmatia
, its Aegean island possessions, and
Crete
. (Losses from the war totalled 30,985 Venetian soldiers and 118,754 Turkish soldiers.)

During his brief majority reign,
Murad IV
(1623-1640) reasserted central authority and recaptured
Iraq
(1639) from the Safavids.
[106]
The resulting
Treaty of Zuhab
of that same year decisively divided the Caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighbouring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 Peace of Amasya.

The
Sultanate of Women
(1533-1656) was a period in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons. The most prominent women of this period were
Kösem Sultan
and her daughter-in-law
Turhan Hatice
, whose political rivalry culminated in Kösem's murder in 1651.
[109]
During the
Köprülü era
(1656-1703), effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of
grand viziers
from the Köprülü family. The Köprülü Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in Transylvania, the conquest of
Crete
completed in 1669, and expansion into
Polish southern Ukraine
, with the strongholds of
Khotyn
, and
Kamianets-Podilskyi
and the territory of

ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.

Frans Geffels
(1624-1694)
This period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end in 1683 when Grand Vizier
Kara Mustafa Pasha
led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of
Vienna
in the
Great Turkish War
of 1683-1699. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German, and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king
John III Sobieski
at the
Battle of Vienna
. The alliance of the
Holy League
pressed home the advantage of the defeat at Vienna, culminating in the
Treaty of Karlowitz
(26 January 1699), which ended the Great Turkish War.
[111]
The Ottomans surrendered control of significant territories, many permanently.
[112]
Mustafa II
(1695-1703) led the counterattack of 1695-1696 against the Habsburgs in Hungary, but was undone at the disastrous defeat at
Zenta
(in modern Serbia), 11 September 1697.
[113]
Military defeats
Aside from the loss of the
Banat
and the temporary loss of
Belgrade
(1717-1739), the Ottoman border on the
Danube
and
Sava
remained stable during the eighteenth century.
Russian expansion
, however, presented a large and growing threat.
[114]
Accordingly, King
Charles XII of Sweden
was welcomed as an ally in the Ottoman Empire following his defeat by the Russians at the
Battle of Poltava
of 1709 in central Ukraine (part of the
Great Northern War
of 1700-1721).
[114]
Charles XII persuaded the Ottoman Sultan
Ahmed III
to declare war on Russia, which resulted in an Ottoman victory in the
Pruth River Campaign
of 1710-1711, in Moldavia.
[115]
Austrian troops led by
Prince Eugene of Savoy
captured
Belgrade
in 1717. Austrian control in Serbia lasted until the Turkish victory in the
Austro-Russian-Turkish War (1735-1739)
. With the 1739
Treaty of Belgrade
, the Ottoman Empire regained northern
Bosnia
,
Habsburg Serbia
(including Belgrade),
Oltenia
and the southern parts of the
Banat of Temeswar
.
After the
Austro-Turkish War
, the
Treaty of Passarowitz
confirmed the loss of the Banat, Serbia, and
"Little Walachia" (Oltenia)
to Austria. The Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe.
[116]
The
Austro-Russian-Turkish War
(1735-1739), which was ended by the
Treaty of Belgrade
in 1739, resulted in the Ottoman recovery of northern
Bosnia
,
Habsburg Serbia
(including Belgrade),
Oltenia
and the southern parts of the
Banat of Temeswar
; but the Empire lost the port of
Azov
, north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. After this treaty the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace, as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of
Prussia
.
[117]
Educational and technological reforms
came about, including the establishment of higher education institutions such as the
Istanbul Technical University
.
[118]
In 1734 an artillery school was established to impart Western-style artillery methods, but the Islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of
theodicy
.
[119]
In 1754 the artillery school was reopened on a semi-secret basis.
[119]
In 1726,
Ibrahim Muteferrika
convinced the Grand Vizier
Nevşehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha
, the
Grand Mufti
, and the clergy on the efficiency of the printing press, and Muteferrika was later granted by Sultan Ahmed III permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some
calligraphers
and religious leaders).
[120]
Muteferrika's press published its first book in 1729 and, by 1743, issued 17 works in 23 volumes, each having between 500 and 1,000 copies.

In North Africa, Spain
conquered Oran
from the autonomous
Deylik of Algiers
. The
Bey of Oran
received an army from Algiers, but it failed to recapture
Oran
; the siege caused the deaths of 1,500 Spaniards, and even more Algerians. The Spanish also massacred many Muslim soldiers.
[122]
In 1792, Spain abandoned Oran, selling it to the Deylik of Algiers.
In 1768 Russian-backed Ukrainian
Haidamakas
, pursuing Polish confederates, entered
Balta
, an Ottoman-controlled town on the border of Bessarabia in Ukraine, massacred its citizens, and burned the town to the ground. This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the
Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774
. The
Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca
of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom of worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia.
[123]
By the late 18th century, after a number of defeats in the wars with Russia, some people in the Ottoman Empire began to conclude that the reforms of
Peter the Great
had given the Russians an edge, and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats.

Selim III
(1789-1807) made the first major attempts to
modernise the army
, but his reforms were hampered by the religious leadership and the
Janissary
corps. Jealous of their privileges and firmly opposed to change, the Janissary
revolted
. Selim's efforts cost him his throne and his life, but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor, the dynamic
Mahmud II
, who
eliminated the Janissary corps
in 1826.
The siege of the Acropolis in 1826-1827 during the
Greek War of Independence
The
Serbian revolution
(1804-1815) marked the beginning of an era of
national awakening
in the
Balkans
during the
Eastern Question
. In 1811, the fundamentalist Wahhabis of Arabia, led by the al-Saud family, revolted against the Ottomans. Unable to defeat the Wahhabi rebels, the Sublime Porte had
Muhammad Ali Pasha
of
Kavala
, the
vali
(governor) of the
Eyalet of Egypt
, tasked with retaking Arabia, which ended with the destruction of the
Emirate of Diriyah
in 1818. The
suzerainty
of Serbia as a hereditary monarchy under its own
dynasty
was acknowledged
de jure
in 1830.
[124]
[125]
In 1821, the
Greeks
declared war
on the Sultan. A rebellion that originated in Moldavia as a diversion was followed by the main revolution in the
Peloponnese
, which, along with the northern part of the
Gulf of Corinth
, became the first parts of the Ottoman Empire to achieve independence (in 1829). In 1830, the French invaded the
Deylik of Algiers
.
The campaign
that took 21 days, resulted in over 5,000 Algerian military casualties,
[126]
and about 2,600 French ones.
[126]
[127]
Before the French invasion the total population of Algeria was most likely between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000.
[128]
By 1873, the population of Algeria (excluding several hundred thousand newly arrived French settlers) decreased to a drastic 2,172,000.
[129]
In 1831,
Muhammad Ali Pasha
revolted against Sultan
Mahmud II
due to the latter's refusal to grant him the governorships of
Greater Syria
and
Crete
, which the Sultan had promised him in exchange for sending military assistance to put down the
Greek revolt
(1821-1829) that ultimately ended with the formal
independence of Greece
in 1830. It was a costly enterprise for Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had lost his fleet at the
Battle of Navarino
in 1827. Thus began the first
Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831-1833)
, during which the French-trained army of Muhammad Ali Pasha, under the command of his son
Ibrahim Pasha
, defeated the Ottoman Army as it marched into
Anatolia
, reaching the city of
Kütahya
within 320 km (200 mi) of the capital, Constantinople.
[130]
: 95
In desperation, Sultan
Mahmud II
appealed to the empire's traditional arch-rival Russia for help, asking Emperor
Nicholas I
to send an expeditionary force to assist him.
[130]
: 96
In return for signing the
Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi
, the Russians sent the expeditionary force which deterred Ibrahim Pasha from marching any further towards Constantinople.
[130]
: 96
Under the terms of the
Convention of Kütahya
, signed on 5 May 1833, Muhammad Ali Pasha agreed to abandon his campaign against the Sultan, in exchange for which he was made the
vali
(governor) of the
vilayets
(provinces) of
Crete
,
Aleppo
,
Tripoli
,
Damascus
and
Sidon
(the latter four comprising modern
Syria
and
Lebanon
), and given the right to collect taxes in
Adana
.
[130]
: 96
Had it not been for the Russian intervention, Sultan
Mahmud II
could have faced the risk of being overthrown and Muhammad Ali Pasha could have even become the new Sultan. These events marked the beginning of a recurring pattern where the Sublime Porte needed the help of foreign powers to protect itself.
[130]
: 95-96
In 1839, the
Sublime Porte
attempted to take back what it lost to the
de facto
autonomous, but
de jure
still Ottoman
Eyalet of Egypt
, but its forces were initially defeated, which led to the
Oriental Crisis of 1840
. Muhammad Ali Pasha had close relations with
France
, and the prospect of him becoming the Sultan of Egypt was widely viewed as putting the entire
Levant
into the French sphere of influence.
[130]
: 96
As the Sublime Porte had proved itself incapable of defeating Muhammad Ali Pasha, the
British Empire
and
Austrian Empire
provided military assistance, and the second
Egyptian-Ottoman War (1839-1841)
ended with Ottoman victory and the restoration of Ottoman suzerainty over
Egypt Eyalet
and the
Levant
.
[130]
: 96
By the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the "
sick man of Europe
". Three suzerain states - the
Principality of Serbia
,
Wallachia
and
Moldavia
- moved towards
de jure
independence during the 1860s and 1870s.
Decline and modernisation (1828-1908)
Main article:
Decline of the Ottoman Empire
Opening ceremony of the First
Ottoman Parliament
at the
Dolmabahçe Palace
in 1876. The
First Constitutional Era
lasted only two years until 1878. The Ottoman Constitution and Parliament were
restored 30 years later
with the
Young Turk Revolution
in 1908.
During the
Tanzimat
period (1839-1876), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern
conscripted army
, banking system reforms, the decriminalization of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law,
[131]
and guilds with modern factories. The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul in 1840. American inventor
Samuel Morse
received an Ottoman patent for the telegraph in 1847, issued by Sultan
Abdülmecid
, who personally tested the invention.
[132]
The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the
Kanûn-u Esâsî
. The empire's
First Constitutional era
was short-lived. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it.

Crimean War
of 1853-1856
The empire's Christian population, owing to their higher educational levels, started to pull ahead of the Muslim majority, leading to much resentment.
[133]
In 1861, there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians, with 140,000 pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology.
[133]
Author Norman Stone suggests that the Arabic alphabet, in which Turkish was written
until 1928
, was ill-suited to reflect the sounds of Turkish (which is a Turkic as opposed to Semitic language), which imposed further difficulty on Turkish children.
[133]
In turn, Christians' higher educational levels allowed them to play a larger role in the economy, with the rise in prominence of groups such as the
Sursock family
indicative of this.
[134]
[133]
In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks.
[133]
In many cases, Christians and Jews gained protection from European consuls and citizenship, meaning they were protected from Ottoman law and not subject to the same economic regulations as their Muslim counterparts.

The
Crimean War
(1853-1856) was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the declining Ottoman Empire. The financial burden of the war led the Ottoman state to issue
foreign loans
amounting to 5
million pounds sterling on 4 August 1854.
[136]
: 32
[137]
: 71
The war caused an exodus of the
Crimean Tatars
, about 200,000 of whom moved to the Ottoman Empire in continuing waves of emigration.
[138]
: 79-108
Toward the end of the
Caucasian Wars
, 90% of the
Circassians
were
ethnically cleansed
[139]
and exiled from their homelands in the Caucasus, fleeing to the Ottoman Empire,
[140]
resulting in the settlement of 500,000 to 700,000 Circassians in Turkey.
[141]
[
]
[142]
[143]
Some Circassian organisations give much higher numbers, totalling 1-1.5
million deported or killed. Crimean Tatar refugees in the late 19th century played an especially notable role in seeking to modernise Ottoman education and in first promoting both
Pan-Turkism
and a sense of Turkish nationalism.
[144]
The Ottoman Empire in 1875 under Sultan
Abdulaziz
In this period, the Ottoman Empire spent only small amounts of public funds on education; for example, in 1860-1861 only 0.2% of the total budget was invested in education.
[145]
: 50
As the Ottoman state attempted to modernize its infrastructure and army in response to outside threats, it opened itself up to a different kind of threat: that of creditors. As the historian Eugene Rogan has written, "the single greatest threat to the independence of the Middle East" in the 19th century "was not the armies of Europe but its banks".
[146]
The Ottoman state, which had begun taking on debt with the Crimean War, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1875.
[147]
By 1881, the Ottoman Empire agreed to have its debt controlled by the
Ottoman Public Debt Administration
, a council of European men with presidency alternating between France and Britain. The body controlled swaths of the Ottoman economy, and used its position to ensure that European capital continued to penetrate the empire, often to the detriment of local Ottoman interests.

The Ottoman

The
Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)
ended with a decisive victory for Russia. As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply:
Bulgaria
was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire;
Romania
achieved full independence; and
Serbia
and
Montenegro
finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories. In 1878,
Austria-Hungary
unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of
Bosnia-Herzegovina
and
Novi Pazar
.
British Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli
advocated restoring the Ottoman territories on the Balkan Peninsula during the
Congress of Berlin
, and in return, Britain assumed the administration of
Cyprus
in 1878.
[149]
: 228-254
Britain later sent troops to
Egypt
in 1882 to put down the
Urabi Revolt
(Sultan
Abdul Hamid II
was too paranoid to mobilize his own army, fearing this would result in a coup d'état), effectively gaining control in both territories. Abdul Hamid II, popularly known as "Abdul Hamid the Damned" on account of his cruelty and paranoia, was so fearful of a coup that he did not allow his army to conduct war games, lest this serve as cover for a coup, but he did see the need for military mobilization. In 1883, a German military mission under General Baron
Colmar von der Goltz
arrived to train the Ottoman Army, leading to the so-called "Goltz generation" of German-trained officers, who played a notable role in the politics of the empire's last years.
[150]
: 24
From 1894 to 1896, between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians living throughout the empire were killed in what became known as the
Hamidian massacres
.
[151]
: 42
In 1897 the population was 19
million, of whom 14
million (74%) were Muslim. An additional 20
million lived in provinces that remained under the sultan's nominal suzerainty but were entirely outside his actual power. One by one the Porte lost nominal authority. They included Egypt, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Lebanon.
[152]
As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank, 7-9
million Muslims from its former territories in the Caucasus,
Crimea
, Balkans, and the
Mediterranean
islands migrated to Anatolia and
Eastern Thrace
.
[153]
After the Empire lost the
First Balkan War
(1912-1913), it lost all its
Balkan
territories except
East Thrace
(European Turkey). This resulted in around 400,000 Muslims fleeing with the retreating Ottoman armies (with many dying from
cholera
brought by the soldiers), and 400,000 non-Muslims fled territory still under Ottoman rule.
[154]
Justin McCarthy
estimates that from 1821 to 1922, 5.5
million Muslims died in southeastern Europe, with the expulsion of 5
million.

The defeat and
dissolution of the Ottoman Empire
(1908—1922) began with the
Second Constitutional Era
, a moment of hope and promise established with the
Young Turk Revolution
. It restored the
Constitution of the Ottoman Empire
and brought in
multi-party politics
with a
two-stage electoral system
(
electoral law
) under the
Ottoman parliament
. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire's citizens to modernise the state's institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers. Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place.
[158]
Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire.
Members of
Young Turks
movement who had once gone underground now established their parties.
[159]
Among them "
Committee of Union and Progress
", and "
Freedom and Accord Party
" were major parties. On the other end of the spectrum were ethnic parties, which included
Poale Zion
,
Al-Fatat
, and
Armenian national movement
organised under
Armenian Revolutionary Federation
. Profiting from the civil strife, Austria-Hungary officially annexed
Bosnia and Herzegovina
in 1908. The last of the
Ottoman censuses
was performed in
1914
. Despite
military reforms
which reconstituted the
Ottoman Modern Army
, the Empire lost its North African territories and the Dodecanese in the
Italo-Turkish War
(1911) and almost all of its European territories in the
Balkan Wars
(1912-1913). The Empire faced continuous unrest in the years leading up to
World War I
, including the
31 March Incident
and two further coups in
1912
and
1913
.

World War I
on the side of the
Central Powers
and was ultimately defeated. The Ottoman participation in the war began with the combined
German-Ottoman surprise attack
on the
Black Sea
coast of the
Russian Empire
on 29 October 1914. Following the attack, the Russian Empire (2 November 1914)
[160]
and its allies
France
(5 November 1914)
[160]
and the
British Empire
(5 November 1914)
[160]
declared war on the Ottoman Empire (also on 5 November 1914, the British government changed the status of the
Khedivate of Egypt
and
Cyprus
, which were
de jure
Ottoman territories prior to the war, as
British protectorates
.)
The Ottomans successfully defended the
Dardanelles
strait during the
Gallipoli campaign
(1915-1916) and achieved initial victories against British forces in the first two years of the
Mesopotamian campaign
, such as the
Siege of Kut
(1915-1916); but the
Arab Revolt
(1916-1918) turned the tide against the Ottomans in the Middle East. In the
Caucasus campaign
, however, the Russian forces had the upper hand from the beginning, especially after the
Battle of Sarikamish
(1914-1915). Russian forces advanced into northeastern
Anatolia
and controlled the major cities there until retreating from World War I with the
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
following the
Russian Revolution
in 1917.

The
Armenian genocide
was the result of the Ottoman government's
deportation
and
ethnic cleansing
policies regarding its
Armenian
citizens after the
Battle of Sarikamish
(1914-1915) and the collapse of the
Caucasus Front
against the
Imperial Russian Army
and
Armenian volunteer units
during
World War I
. An estimated 600,000
[161]
to more than 1 million,
[161]
or up to 1.5 million
[162]
[163]
[164]
people were killed.
In 1915 the Ottoman government and Kurdish tribes in the region started the extermination of its ethnic Armenian population, resulting in the deaths of up to 1.5
million Armenians in the
Armenian genocide
.
[165]
[166]
The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on
death marches
leading to the
Syrian desert
. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery,
rape
, and systematic massacre.
[167]
[168]
Large-scale massacres were also committed against the Empire's
Greek
and
Assyrian
minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing.

Arab Revolt
Main articles:
Middle Eastern theatre of World War I
and
Arab Revolt
The
Arab Revolt
began in 1916 with British support. It turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. On the basis of the
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence
, an agreement between the British government and
Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca
, the revolt was officially initiated at Mecca on 10 June 1916.
[o]
The Arab nationalist goal was to create a single unified and independent
Arab state
stretching from
Aleppo
,
Syria
, to
Aden
,
Yemen
, which the British promised to recognise.
The
Sharifian Army
, led by Hussein and the
Hashemites
, with military backing from the British
Egyptian Expeditionary Force
, successfully fought and expelled the Ottoman military presence from much of the
Hejaz
and
Transjordan
. The rebellion eventually took
Damascus
and set up a short-lived monarchy led by
Faisal
, a son of Hussein.
Following the terms of the 1916
Sykes-Picot Agreement
, the British and French later partitioned the Middle East into
mandate territories
. There was no unified Arab state, much to Arab nationalists' anger.
Treaty of Sèvres and Turkish War of Independence
Mehmed VI
, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, leaving the country after the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate, 17 November 1922
Defeated in World War I, the Ottoman Empire signed the
Armistice of Mudros
on 30 October 1918.
Istanbul was occupied
by combined British, French, Italian, and Greek forces. In May 1919, Greece also
took control of the area around Smyrna
(now İzmir).
The
partition of the Ottoman Empire
was finalized under the terms of the 1920
Treaty of Sèvres
. This treaty, as designed in the
Conference of London
, allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. Anatolia's status was problematic given the occupied forces.
A nationalist opposition arose in the
Turkish national movement
. It won the
Turkish War of Independence
(1919-1923) under the leadership of
Mustafa Kemal
(later given the surname "Atatürk"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan,
Mehmed VI
(reigned 1918-1922), left the country on 17 November 1922. The
Republic of Turkey
was
established
in its place on 29 October 1923, in the new capital city of
Ankara
. The
caliphate
was abolished on 3 March 1924.

Historiographical debate on the Ottoman state
See also:
Ghaza thesis
Several historians, such as British historian
Edward Gibbon
and the Greek historian
Dimitri Kitsikis
, have argued that after the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Byzantine (Roman) state and that the Ottoman Empire was in essence a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a
Turkish
Muslim
guise.
[172]
The American historian
Speros Vryonis
writes that the Ottoman state centered on "a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the Turkish language and the Islamic religion".
[173]
Kitsikis and the American historian
Heath Lowry
posit that the early Ottoman state was a predatory confederacy open to both Byzantine Christians and Turkish Muslims whose primary goal was attaining booty and slaves, rather than spreading Islam, and that Islam only later became the empire's primary characteristic.
[174]
[175]
[176]
Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian
Paul Wittek
, who emphasizes the early Ottoman state's Islamic character, seeing it as a "
jihad
state" dedicated to expanding the
Muslim world
.
[173]
Many historians led in 1937 by the Turkish historian
Mehmet Fuat Köprülü
championed the
Ghaza thesis
, according to which the early Ottoman state was a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic
Turkic tribes
who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale. They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from
Persia
.
[177]
The British historian
Norman Stone
suggests many continuities between the Eastern Roman and Ottoman empires, such as that the
zeugarion
tax of Byzantium became the Ottoman
Resm-i çift
tax, that the
pronoia
land-holding system that linked the amount of land one owned with one's ability to raise cavalry became the Ottoman
timar
system, and that the Ottoman land measurement the
dönüm
was the same as the Byzantine
stremma
. Stone also argues that although Sunni Islam was the state religion, the Ottoman state supported and controlled the
Eastern Orthodox Church
, which in return for accepting that control became the Ottoman Empire's largest land-holder. Despite the similarities, Stone argues that a crucial difference is that the land grants under the
timar
system were not hereditary at first. Even after they became inheritable, land ownership in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan revoked land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged
Timariots
from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led them to adopt a strategy of short-term exploitation, which had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.

and 1856 to 1922,
[180]
respectively.
Before the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the
state organisation of the Ottoman Empire
was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration. The Sultan was in the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic
Iran
remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.
[181]
According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of
orthodox
Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.
[182]
Ambassadors at the Topkapı Palace
The Ottoman Empire, or as a dynastic institution, the House of Osman, was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration.
[183]
In Europe, only the
House of Habsburg
had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.
[182]
As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (
r.
1918-1922
) was a
direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant
of the first Ottoman sultan
Osman I
(
d.
1323/4), which was unparalleled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world. The primary purpose of the
Imperial Harem
was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the Ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal (male-line) power of the Ottoman sultans in the future generations.
The highest position in Islam,
caliph
, was claimed by the sultans starting with
Selim I
,
[20]
which was established as the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan,
pâdişâh
or "lord of kings", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the
valide sultan
. On occasion, the valide sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the "
Sultanate of Women
". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan.

The strong educational system of the
palace school
was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the
Madrasa
(
Medrese
) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by
vakif
s, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income.
[184]
The second track was a free
boarding school
for the Christians, the
Enderûn
,
[185]
which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in
Rumelia
or the Balkans, a process known as
Devshirme
(
Devşirme
).
[186]
Though the sultan was the supreme monarch, the sultan's political and executive authority was delegated. The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as
Divan
. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a
Beylik
, was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the
de facto
head of state.

Throughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces. The representatives formed the
Imperial Government of the Ottoman Empire
.
This eclectic administration was apparent even in the diplomatic correspondence of the Empire, which was initially undertaken in the
Greek language
to the west.
[188]
The
Tughra
were calligraphic monograms, or signatures, of the Ottoman Sultans, of which there were 35. Carved on the Sultan's seal, they bore the names of the Sultan and his father. The statement and prayer, "ever victorious", was also present in most. The earliest belonged to Orhan Gazi. The ornately stylized
Tughra
spawned a branch of Ottoman-Turkish
calligraphy
.
Law
Main article:
Ottoman law
The Ottoman legal system accepted the
religious law
over its subjects. At the same time the
Qanun
(or
Kanun
), dynastic law, co-existed with religious law or
Sharia
.
[189]
[190]
The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local
jurisprudence
. Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority.
[191]
Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local
millet
.
[191]
The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups.
[191]
The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the "trade court". The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative
Qanun
, i.e., laws, a system based upon the Turkic
Yassa
and
Töre
, which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.
[192]
[193]
An Ottoman trial, 1877
These court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive; for instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic
Sharia
law system had been developed from a combination of the
Qur'an
; the
Hadīth
, or words of the prophet
Muhammad
;
ijmā'
, or consensus of the members of the
Muslim community
;
qiyas
, a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs. Both systems were taught at the Empire's law schools, which were in
Istanbul
and
Bursa
.

Qadi

[194]
The Ottoman Islamic legal system was set up differently from traditional European courts. Presiding over Islamic courts would be a
Qadi
, or judge. Since the closing of the
ijtihad
, or 'Gate of Interpretation',
Qadi
s throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent, and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered.
[191]
However, the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure, leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favour.
In the late 19th century, the Ottoman legal system saw substantial reform. This process of legal modernisation began with the
Edict of Gülhane
of 1839.
[195]
These reforms included the "fair and public trial[s] of all accused regardless of religion", the creation of a system of "separate competences, religious and civil", and the validation of testimony on non-Muslims.
[196]
Specific land codes (1858), civil codes (1869-1876), and a code of civil procedure also were enacted.
[196]
These reforms were based heavily on French models, as indicated by the adoption of a three-tiered court system. Referred to as
Nizamiye
, this system was extended to the local magistrate level with the final promulgation of the
Mecelle
, a civil code that regulated marriage, divorce, alimony, will, and other matters of personal status.
[196]
In an attempt to clarify the division of judicial competences, an administrative council laid down that religious matters were to be handled by religious courts, and statute matters were to be handled by the Nizamiye courts.

Military

Military of the Ottoman Empire

The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century. The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the
Ottoman Army
included Janissary,
Sipahi
,
Akıncı
and
Mehterân
. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using
falconets
, which were short but wide cannons, during the
Siege of Constantinople
. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armor, using bows and short swords on fast
Turkoman
and
Arabian
horses (progenitors of the
Thoroughbred
racing horse),
[197]
[198]
and often applied tactics similar to those of the
Mongol Empire
, such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack. The Ottoman army continued to be an effective fighting force throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries,
[199]
[200]
falling behind the empire's European rivals only during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768.
[35]

The modernization of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century started with the military. In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the
Nizam-ı Cedid
(New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.

The

vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of
Algeria
and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of Greece in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan
Abdülaziz
(reigned 1861-1876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France. The shipyard at Barrow, England, built its first
submarine
in 1886 for the Ottoman Empire.
[201]
However, the collapsing Ottoman economy could not sustain the fleet's strength for long. Sultan
Abdülhamid II
distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist
Midhat Pasha
and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War. He locked most of the fleet inside the
Golden Horn
, where the ships decayed for the next 30 years. Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Committee of Union and Progress sought to develop a strong Ottoman naval force. The
Ottoman Navy Foundation
was established in 1910 to buy new ships through public donations.
Ottoman pilots
in early 1912
The establishment of
Ottoman military aviation
dates back to between June 1909 and July 1911.
[202]
[203]
The Ottoman Empire started preparing its first pilots and planes, and with the founding of the Aviation School (
Tayyare Mektebi
) in
Yeşilköy
on 3 July 1912, the Empire began to tutor its own flight officers. The founding of the Aviation School quickened advancement in the military aviation program, increased the number of enlisted persons within it, and gave the new pilots an active role in the Ottoman Army and Navy. In May 1913, the world's first specialized Reconnaissance Training Program was started by the Aviation School, and the first separate reconnaissance division was established.

In June 1914 a new military academy, the Naval Aviation School (
Bahriye Tayyare Mektebi
) was founded. With the outbreak of World War I, the modernization process stopped abruptly. The

fought on many fronts during World War I, from
Galicia
in the west to the Caucasus in the east and

in the south.

The Ottoman Empire was first subdivided into provinces, in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan, in the late 14th century.
[204]
The
Eyalet
(also
Pashalik
or
Beylerbeylik
) was the territory of office of a
Beylerbey
("lord of lords" or governor), and was further subdivided in
Sanjaks
.
[205]
The
Vilayets
were introduced with the promulgation of the "Vilayet Law" (
Teskil-i Vilayet Nizamnamesi
)
[206]
in 1864, as part of the Tanzimat reforms.
[207]
Unlike the previous eyalet system, the 1864 law established a hierarchy of administrative units: the vilayet,
liva
/
sanjak
/
mutasarrifate
,

and

Ottoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of Bursa, Edirne, and Istanbul, successive Ottoman capitals, into major commercial and industrial centers, considering that merchants and artisans were indispensable in creating a new metropolis.
[209]
To this end, Mehmed and his successor Bayezid, also encouraged and welcomed migration of the Jews from different parts of Europe, who were settled in Istanbul and other port cities like Salonica. In many places in Europe, Jews were suffering persecution at the hands of their Christian counterparts, such as in Spain, after the conclusion of Reconquista. The tolerance displayed by the Turks was welcomed by the immigrants.

The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous.
[210]
The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact. The Ottoman economy greatly expanded during the early modern period, with particularly high growth rates during the first half of the eighteenth century. The empire's annual income quadrupled between 1523 and 1748, adjusted for inflation.
[211]
The organization of the treasury and chancery were developed under the Ottoman Empire more than any other Islamic government and, until the 17th century, they were the leading organization among all their contemporaries.
[187]
This organisation developed a scribal bureaucracy (known as "men of the pen") as a distinct group, partly highly trained ulama, which developed into a professional body.
[187]
The effectiveness of this professional financial body stands behind the success of many great Ottoman statesmen.
[212]

Modern Ottoman studies indicate that the change in relations between the Ottoman Turks and central Europe was caused by the opening of the new sea routes. It is possible to see the decline in the significance of the land routes to the East as Western Europe opened the ocean routes that bypassed the Middle East and the Mediterranean as parallel to the decline of the Ottoman Empire itself.
[213]
[
]
The
Anglo-Ottoman Treaty
, also known as the
Treaty of Balta Liman
that opened the Ottoman markets directly to English and French competitors, would be seen as one of the staging posts along with this development.
By developing commercial centers and routes, encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions, the state performed basic economic functions in the Empire. But in all this, the financial and political interests of the state were dominant. Within the social and political system they were living in, Ottoman administrators could not see the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in Western Europe.
[214]
Economic historian
Paul Bairoch
argues that
free trade
contributed to
deindustrialisation
in the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to the
protectionism
of China, Japan, and Spain, the Ottoman Empire had a
liberal trade
policy, open to foreign imports. This has origins in
capitulations of the Ottoman Empire
, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with
capitulations
in 1673 and 1740, which lowered
duties
to 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists, such as
John Ramsay McCulloch
in his
Dictionary of Commerce
(1834), but later criticized by British politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846
Corn Laws
debate.
[215]
Demographics

A population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520-1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5.
[216]
For unclear reasons, the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century.
[217]
An estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount, as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts.
[216]
Censuses of Ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century. Figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results, but the censuses did not cover the whole population. For example, the 1831 census only counted men and did not cover the whole empire.
[103]
[216]
For earlier periods estimates of size and distribution of the population are based on observed demographic patterns.
[218]

However, it began to rise to reach 25-32 million by 1800, with around 10 million in the European provinces (primarily in the Balkans), 11 million in the Asiatic provinces, and around 3 million in the African provinces. Population densities were higher in the European provinces, double those in Anatolia, which in turn were triple the population densities of Iraq and
Syria
and five times the population density of Arabia.
[219]
Towards the end of the empire's existence life expectancy was 49 years, compared to the mid-twenties in Serbia at the beginning of the 19th century.
[220]
Epidemic diseases and famine caused major disruption and demographic changes. In 1785 around one-sixth of the Egyptian population died from the plague and Aleppo saw its population reduced by twenty percent in the 18th century. Six famines hit Egypt alone between 1687 and 1731 and the last famine to hit Anatolia was four decades later.
[221]
The rise of port cities saw the clustering of populations caused by the development of steamships and railroads. Urbanization increased from 1700 to 1922, with towns and cities growing. Improvements in health and sanitation made them more attractive to live and work in. Port cities like Salonica, in Greece, saw its population rise from 55,000 in 1800 to 160,000 in 1912 and İzmir which had a population of 150,000 in 1800 grew to 300,000 by 1914.
[222]
[223]
Some regions conversely had population falls—Belgrade saw its population drop from 25,000 to 8,000 mainly due to political strife.
[222]
The town of
Safranbolu
is one of the best preserved Ottoman villages.
Economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire. For example, the
Russian
and Austria-Habsburg annexation of the Crimean and Balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of Muslim refugees—200,000 Crimean Tartars fleeing to Dobruja.
[224]
Between 1783 and 1913, approximately 5-7 million refugees flooded into the Ottoman Empire, at least 3.8 million of whom were from Russia. Some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire (e.g., Turkey and Bulgaria), whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories, simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations. Economies were also impacted by the loss of artisans, merchants, manufacturers, and agriculturists.
[225]
Since the 19th century, a large proportion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans emigrated to present-day Turkey. These people are called
Muhacir
.
[226]
By the time the Ottoman Empire came to an end in 1922, half of the urban population of Turkey was descended from Muslim refugees from Russia.

Language
Main article:
Languages of the Ottoman Empire
1911 Ottoman calendar shown in several different languages such as: Ottoman Turkish, Greek, Armenian, Hebrew, Bulgarian and French
Ottoman Turkish
was the official language of the Empire. It was an
Oghuz
Turkic language
highly influenced by
Persian
and
Arabic
, though lower registries spoken by the common people had fewer influences from other languages compared to higher varieties used by upper classes and governmental authorities.
[227]
Turkish, in its Ottoman variation, was a language of military and administration since the nascent days of the Ottomans. The Ottoman constitution of 1876 did officially cement the official imperial status of Turkish.
[228]
The Ottomans had several influential languages: Turkish, spoken by the majority of the people in Anatolia and by the majority of Muslims of the Balkans except in
Albania
,
Bosnia
[229]
and the
Megleno-Romanian
-inhabited
Nânti
;
[230]
Persian, only spoken by the educated;
[229]
Arabic, spoken mainly in Egypt, the
Levant
,
Arabia
, Iraq, North Africa,
Kuwait
and parts of the
Horn of Africa
and
Berber
in North Africa. In the last two centuries, usage of these became limited, though, and specific: Persian served mainly as a literary language for the educated,
[229]
while
Arabic
was used for Islamic prayers. In the post-
Tanzimat
period French became the common Western language among the educated.
[18]
Because of a low literacy rate among the public (about 2-3% until the early 19th century and just about 15% at the end of the 19th century), ordinary people had to hire
scribes
as "special request-writers" (
arzuhâlci
s) to be able to communicate with the government.
[231]
Some ethnic groups continued to speak within their families and neighborhoods (
mahalles
) with their own languages, though many non-Muslim minorities such as Greeks and Armenians only spoke Turkish.
[232]
In villages where two or more populations lived together, the inhabitants would often speak each other's language. In cosmopolitan cities, people often spoke their family languages; many of those who were not ethnic
Turks
spoke Turkish as a second language.

Abdülmecid II
was the last
caliph
of Islam and a member of the
Ottoman dynasty
.
Sunni Islam
was the prevailing
Dīn
(customs, legal traditions, and religion) of the Ottoman Empire; the official
Madh'hab
(school of Islamic
jurisprudence
) was
Hanafi
.
[233]
From the early 16th century until the early 20th century, the Ottoman sultan also served as the
caliph
, or politico-religious leader, of the
Muslim world
. Most of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to
Sufism
and followed
Sufi orders
, and believed Sufism was the correct way to reach God.
[234]
Non-Muslims, particularly Christians and Jews, were present throughout the empire's history. The Ottoman imperial system was charactised by an intricate combination of official Muslim hegemony over non-Muslims and a wide degree of religious tolerance. While religious minorities were never equal under the law, they were granted recognition, protection, and limited freedoms under both Islamic and Ottoman tradition.
[235]
Until the second half of the 15th century, the majority of Ottoman subjects were Christian.
[191]
Non-Muslims remained a significant and economically influential minority, albeit declining significantly by the 19th century, due largely to migration and
secession
.
[235]
The proportion of Muslims amounted to 60% in the 1820s, gradually increasing to 69% in the 1870s and 76% in the 1890s.
[235]
By 1914, less than a fifth of the empire's population (19.1%) was non-Muslim, mostly made up of Jews and Christian Greeks, Assyrians, and Armenians.

facilitated the spread of Islam into the Turkic heartland of Central Asia. Many Turkic tribes—including the
Oghuz Turks
, who were the ancestors of both the Seljuks and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam and brought religion to Anatolia through their migrations beginning in the 11th century. From its founding, the Ottoman Empire officially supported the

Islamic theology
, which emphasized

However, some heterodox Muslim groups were viewed as heretical and even ranked below Jews and Christians in terms of legal protection; Druze were frequent targets of persecution,

), whom he considered a
fifth column
for the rival
Safavid Empire
.
During Selim's reign, the Ottoman Empire saw an unprecedented and rapid expansion into the Middle East, particularly the
conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt
on the early 16th century. These conquests further solidified the Ottoman claim of being an
Islamic caliphate
, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the reign of Murad I (1362-1389).
[20]
The caliphate was officially transferred from the Mamluks to the Ottoman sultanate in 1517, whose members would be recognized as caliphs until the
office's abolition on 3 March 1924
by the
Republic of Turkey
(and the exile of the last caliph,
Abdülmecid II
, to France).
Christianity and Judaism

In accordance with the Muslim
dhimmi
system, the Ottoman Empire guaranteed limited freedoms to Christians, Jews, and other "
people of the book
", such as the right to worship, own property, and be exempt from the obligatory alms (
z
akat
) required of Muslims. However, non-Muslims (or
dhimmi
) were subject to various legal restrictions, including being forbidden to carry weapons, ride on horseback, or have their homes overlook those of Muslims; likewise, they were required to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects, including the
jizya
,
which was a key source of state revenue.
[245]
[246]
Many Christians and Jews converted to Islam to secure full social and legal status, though most continued to practice their faith without restriction.
The Ottomans developed a unique sociopolitical system known as the
millet
, which granted non-Muslim communities a large degree of political, legal, and religious autonomy; in essence, members of a millet were subjects of the empire but not subject to the Muslim faith or Islamic law. A millet could govern its own affairs, such as raising taxes and resolving internal legal disputes, with little or no interference from Ottoman authorities, so long as its members were loyal to the sultan and adhered to the rules concerning
dhimmi.
A quintessential example is the ancient Orthodox community of
Mount Athos
, which was permitted to retain its autonomy and was never subject to occupation or forced conversion; even special laws were enacted to protect it from outsiders.
[247]
The
Rum
Millet
, which encompassed most Eastern Orthodox Christians, was governed by the Byzantine-era
Corpus Juris Civilis
(Code of Justinian), with the
Ecumenical Patriarch
designated the highest religious and political authority (
millet-bashi
, or
ethnarch
). Likewise,
Ottoman Jews
came under the authority of the
Haham Başı
,
or Ottoman
Chief Rabbi
, while
Armenians
were under the authority of the
chief bishop
of the
Armenian Apostolic Church
.
[248]
As the largest group of non-Muslim subjects, the Rum Millet enjoyed several special privileges in politics and commerce; however, Jews and Armenians were also well represented among the wealthy merchant class, as well as in public administration.
[249]
[250]
Some modern scholars consider the millet system to be an early example of
religious pluralism
, as it accorded minority religious groups official recognition and tolerance.
[251]

Beginning in the early 19th century, society, government, and religion were interrelated in a complex, overlapping way that was deemed inefficient by Atatürk, who systematically dismantled it after 1922.
[252]
[253]
In Constantinople, the Sultan ruled two distinct domains: the secular government and the religious hierarchy. Religious officials formed the Ulama, who had control of religious teachings and theology, and also the Empire's judicial system, giving them a major voice in day-to-day affairs in communities across the Empire (but not including the non-Muslim millets). They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan
Selim III
. His successor Sultan
Mahmud II
(r. 1808-1839) first won ulama approval before proposing similar reforms.
[254]
The secularisation program brought by Atatürk ended the ulema and their institutions. The caliphate was abolished, madrasas were closed down, and the sharia courts were abolished. He replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin letters, ended the religious school system, and gave women some political rights. Many rural traditionalists never accepted this secularisation, and by the 1990s they were reasserting a demand for a larger role for Islam.
[255]
The original
Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Istanbul
was built in 1725 by the local Italian community of Istanbul.
The Janissaries were a highly formidable military unit in the early years, but as Western Europe modernized its military organization technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened, or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or they might be superseded by the cavalrymen, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West.
[256]
[257]
The political system was transformed by the destruction of the
Janissaries
, a powerful military/governmental/police force, which revolted in the
Auspicious Incident
of 1826. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt executed the leaders and disbanded the large organization. That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology.
The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire. The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into the Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning. A large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called millets.
[258]
They were primarily
Greek
,
Armenian
, or
Jewish
. In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.
[259]
In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millet system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support. Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.
[260]
Hemdat Israel Synagogue

Istanbul
At the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the
ayans
or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.
[261]
The economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century, for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.
After the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism. The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the result that they came out as one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.

Culture of the Ottoman Empire
Depiction of a

shop in
Lebanon
The Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Although the predominant literary language of the Ottoman Empire was Turkish, Persian was the preferred vehicle for the projection of an imperial image.
[263]
Slavery
was part of Ottoman society,
[264]
with most slaves employed as domestic servants. Agricultural slavery, like that in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of
chattel slavery
, slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, and the children of female slaves were born legally free. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908.
[265]
During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the Ottoman slave trade but slavery had centuries of religious backing and sanction and so was never abolished in the Empire.
[248]
Plague
remained a major scourge in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. "Between 1701 and 1750, 37 larger and smaller plague epidemics were recorded in Istanbul, and 31 between 1751 and 1801."
[266]
Ottomans adopted Persian bureaucratic traditions and culture. The sultans also made an important contribution in the development of Persian literature.
[267]
Language was not an obvious sign of group connection and identity in the 16th century among the rulers of the Ottoman Empire,
Safavid Iran
and
Abu'l-Khayrid Shibanids
of
Central Asia
.
[268]
Hence the ruling classes of all three polities were bilingual in varieties of Persian and Turkic.
[268]
But in the century's final quarter, linguistic adjustments occurred in the Ottoman and Safavid realms defined by a new rigidity that favoured Ottoman Turkish and Persian, respectively.
[268]
Education
Main article:
Education in the Ottoman Empire
The Beyazıt State Library was founded in 1884.
In the Ottoman Empire, each
millet
established a schooling system serving its members.
[269]
Education was therefore largely divided on ethnic and religious lines: few non-Muslims attended schools for Muslim students, and vice versa. Most institutions that served all ethnic and religious groups taught in French or other languages.
[270]
Several "foreign schools" (
Frerler mektebleri
) operated by religious clergy primarily served Christians, although some Muslim students attended.
[269]
Garnett described the schools for Christians and Jews as "organised upon European models", with "voluntary contributions" supporting their operation and most of them "well attended" and with "a high standard of education".
[271]
Literature
Main article:
Ottoman literature
The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and
prose
. Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European
romance
, short story, or novel. Analog genres did exist, though, in both
Turkish folk literature
and in
Divan poetry
.
Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the
Persian poetry
that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (
مراعات نظير
mura'ât-i nazîr
/
تناسب
tenâsüb
) and opposition (
تضاد
tezâd
) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was
lyric
in nature: either
gazels
(which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasîdes. But there were other common genres, especially the mesnevî, a kind of
verse romance
and thus a variety of
narrative poetry
; the two most notable examples of this form are the
Leyli and Majnun
of
Fuzuli
and the
Hüsn ü Aşk
of
Şeyh Gâlib
. The
Seyahatnâme
of
Evliya Çelebi
(1611-1682) is an outstanding example of travel literature.
Ahmet Nedîm Efendi
, one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets
Until the 19th century,
Ottoman prose
did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of
sec
(
سجع
, also transliterated as
seci
), or
rhymed prose
,
[272]
a type of writing descended from the Arabic
saj'
that prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though it was exclusively nonfictional. One apparent exception was
Muhayyelât
(
Fancies
) by
Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi
, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was
Vartan Pasha
's 1851
The Story of Akabi
(Turkish:
Akabi Hikyayesi
). It was written in Turkish but with
Armenian
script.
[273]
[274]
[275]
[276]
Due to historically close ties with France,
French literature
constituted the major Western influence on Ottoman literature in the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period had Ottoman equivalents; in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of
Romanticism
can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the
Realist
and
Naturalist
movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, the influence of the
Symbolist
and
Parnassian
movements was paramount.
Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously; for instance, the poet
Namık Kemal
also wrote the important 1876 novel
İntibâh
(
Awakening
), while the journalist
İbrahim Şinasi
is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the
one-act
comedy
Şair Evlenmesi
(
The Poet's Marriage
). An earlier play, a
farce
titled
Vakâyi'-i 'Acibe ve Havâdis-i Garibe-yi Kefşger Ahmed
(
The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed
), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there is doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist
Ahmed Midhat Efendi
wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (
Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr
, 1873;
Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery
), Realism (
Henüz on Yedi Yaşında
, 1881;
Just Seventeen Years Old
), and Naturalism (
Müşâhedât
, 1891;
Observations
). This diversity was, in part, due to Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman
social structures
.
[277]
Media
Main article:
Media of the Ottoman Empire
The media of the Ottoman Empire was diverse, with newspapers and journals published in languages including
French
,
[278]
Greek
,
[279]
and
German
.
[248]
Many of these publications were centered in
Constantinople
,
[280]
but there were also French-language newspapers produced in
Beirut
,
Salonika
, and
Smyrna
.
[281]
Non-Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a
lingua franca
and used French-language publications,
[278]
while some provincial newspapers were published in
Arabic
.
[282]
The use of French in the media persisted until the
end of the empire
in 1923 and for a few years thereafter in the
Republic of Turkey
.

The architecture of the empire developed from earlier
Seljuk Turkish architecture
, with influences from
Byzantine
and
Iranian
architecture and other architectural traditions in the Middle East.
[283]
[284]
[285]
Early Ottoman architecture
experimented with multiple building types over the course of the 13th to 15th centuries, progressively evolving into the
Classical Ottoman style
of the 16th and 17th centuries, which was also strongly influenced by the
Hagia Sophia
.
[285]
[286]
The most important architect of the Classical period is
Mimar Sinan
, whose major works include the
Şehzade Mosque
,
Süleymaniye Mosque
, and
Selimiye Mosque
.
[287]
[288]
The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional
Byzantine art
with elements of
Chinese art
.
[289]
The second half of the 16th century also saw the apogee of certain decorative arts, most notably in the use of
Iznik tiles
.
[290]
Beginning in the 18th century, Ottoman architecture was influenced by the
Baroque architecture
in Western Europe, resulting in the
Ottoman Baroque
style.
[291]
Nuruosmaniye Mosque
is one of the most important examples from this period.
[292]
[293]
The last Ottoman period saw more influences from Western Europe, brought in by architects such as those from the
Balyan family
.
[294]
Empire style
and
Neoclassical
motifs were introduced and a trend towards
eclecticism
was evident in many types of buildings, such as the
Dolmabaçe Palace
.
[295]
The last decades of the Ottoman Empire also saw the development of a new architectural style called neo-Ottoman or Ottoman revivalism, also known as the
First National Architectural Movement
,
[296]
by architects such as
Mimar Kemaleddin
and
Vedat Tek
.
[294]
Ottoman dynastic patronage was concentrated in the historic capitals of Bursa, Edirne, and Istanbul (Constantinople), as well as in several other important administrative centers such as
Amasya
and
Manisa
. It was in these centers that most important developments in Ottoman architecture occurred and that the most monumental Ottoman architecture can be found.
[297]
Major religious monuments were typically architectural complexes, known as a
külliye
, that had multiple components providing different services or amenities. In addition to a mosque, these could include a
madrasa
, a
hammam
, an
imaret
, a
sebil
, a market, a
caravanserai
, a
primary school
, or others.
[298]
These complexes were governed and managed with the help of a
vakıf
agreement (Arabic
waqf
).
[298]
Ottoman constructions were still abundant in Anatolia and in the Balkans (Rumelia), but in the more distant Middle Eastern and North African provinces older
Islamic architectural
styles continued to hold strong influence and were sometimes blended with Ottoman styles.
[299]
[300]
Decorative arts
Further information:
Ottoman illumination
and
Ottoman miniature
Ottoman miniature
lost its function with the Westernization of Ottoman culture.
The tradition of
Ottoman miniatures
, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the
Persian
art form, though it also included elements of the
Byzantine
tradition of
illumination
and painting.
[301]
A Greek academy of painters, the
Nakkashane-i-Rum
, was established in the
Topkapi Palace
in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the
Nakkashane-i-Irani
, was added.
Surname-i Hümayun
(Imperial Festival Books) were albums that commemorated celebrations in the Ottoman Empire in pictorial and textual detail.
Ottoman illumination
covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in
muraqqa
or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the
Ottoman miniature
. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (
taswir
), calligraphy (
hat
),
Islamic calligraphy
, bookbinding (
cilt
) and
paper marbling
(
ebru
). In the Ottoman Empire,
illuminated and illustrated manuscripts
were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in
Nakkashane
, the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums
levha
consisted of illuminated calligraphy (
hat
) of
tughra
, religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.
The art of carpet
weaving
was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.
[302]
The weaving of such carpets originated in the
nomadic
cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs, and
kilims
not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.
[303]
Music and performing arts
Further information:
Ottoman Music
Ottoman classical music
was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite. A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as
Selim III
, whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of
Byzantine music
,
Armenian music
,
Arabic music
, and
Persian music
. Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called
usul
, which are somewhat similar to
meter
in Western music, and
melodic
units called
makam
, which bear some resemblance to Western
musical modes
.
The
instruments
used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the
saz
, the
bağlama
, the
kemence
), other Middle Eastern instruments (the
ud
, the
tanbur
, the
kanun
, the
ney
), and—later in the tradition—Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of
folk music
were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian Türküs, North-Eastern (
Laz
) Türküs, Aegean Türküs, Central Anatolian Türküs, Eastern Anatolian Türküs, and Caucasian Türküs. Some of the distinctive styles were:
Janissary music
,
Roma music
,
Belly dance
,
Turkish folk music
.
The traditional
shadow play
called
Karagöz and Hacivat
was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.
[304]
[305]
It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by
tambourine
(
def
). Its origins are obscure, deriving perhaps from an older Egyptian tradition, or possibly from an Asian source.

Ottoman cuisine

Ottoman cuisine
is the cuisine of the capital, Constantinople (
Istanbul
), and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared. This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through
Ramadan
events, and through the cooking at the
Yalıs
of the
Pashas
, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.
Much of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially

Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire
The
Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din
in 1577
Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.
[69]
A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.
Sultan Mehmet II
ordered
Georgios Amiroutzes
, a Greek scholar from
Trabzon
, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of
Ptolemy
. Another example is
Ali Qushji
- an
astronomer
,
mathematician
and
physicist
originally from
Samarkand
- who became a professor in two madrasas and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years in Constantinople before his death.
[307]
Taqi al-Din
built the
Constantinople observatory of Taqi al-Din
in 1577, where he carried out observations until 1580. He calculated the
eccentricity
of the Sun's orbit and the annual motion of the
apogee
.
[308]
However, the observatory's primary purpose was almost certainly
astrological
rather than astronomical, leading to its destruction in 1580 due to the rise of a clerical faction that opposed its use for that purpose.
[309]
He also experimented with
steam power
in
Ottoman Egypt
in 1551, when he described a
steam jack
driven by a rudimentary
steam turbine
.

Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions existed in Egypt for the adoption of
oil
as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.

In the 19th century,
Ishak Efendi
is credited with introducing the then current Western scientific ideas and developments to the Ottoman and wider Muslim world, as well as the invention of a suitable Turkish and Arabic scientific terminology, through his translations of Western works.

The
War Office
has referred to several British government organisations in history, all relating to the army.  It was a
department of the British Government
responsible for the administration of the
British Army
between 1857 and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the new
Ministry of Defence
(MoD).
[1]
It was at that time, equivalent to the
Admiralty
, responsible for the
Royal Navy
(RN), and (much later) the
Air Ministry
, which oversaw the
Royal Air Force
(RAF).  The name 'War Office' is also given to the former home of the department, located at the junction of
Horse Guards Avenue
and
Whitehall
in central London.  The landmark building was sold on 1 March 2016 by
HM Government
for more than
£
350 million, on a 250 year lease for conversion into a luxury hotel and residential apartments.
Prior to 1855, 'War Office' signified the office of the
Secretary at War
.  In the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of independent offices and individuals were responsible for various aspects of Army administration.  The most important were the
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces
, the
Secretary at War
, and the twin
Secretaries of State
; most of whose military responsibilities were passed to a new
Secretary of State for War
in 1794.  Others who performed specialist functions were the
controller
of army accounts, the
Army Medical Board
, the
Commissariat
Department, the Board of General Officers, the
Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces
, the Commissary General of
Muster
, the
Paymaster General of the forces
, and (particularly with regard to the
Militia
) the
Home Office
.
[1]
The term
War Department
was initially used for the separate office of the Secretary of State for War; in 1855, the offices of Secretary at War and Secretary of State for War were amalgamated, and thereafter the terms War Office and War Department were used somewhat interchangeably.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
The War Office developed from the
Council of War
, an
ad hoc
grouping of the King and his senior military commanders which managed the
Kingdom of England
's wars and campaigns. The management of the War Office was directed initially by the
Secretary at War
, whose role had originated during the reign of
King Charles II
as the secretary to the
Commander-in-Chief of the Army
. In the latter part of the 17th century, the office of Commander-in-Chief was vacant for several periods, which left the Secretary at War answering directly to the Sovereign; and thereafter, even when the office of Commander-in-Chief was restored on a more permanent basis, the Secretary at War retained his independence.
[2]
The department of the Secretary at War was referred to as the 'Warr Office' (sic) from as early as 1694;
[2]
its foundation has traditionally been ascribed to
William Blathwayt
, who had accompanied
King William III
during the
Nine Years' War
and who, from his appointment as Secretary in 1684, had greatly expanded the remit of his office to cover general day-to-day administration of the Army.
[3]
After Blathwayt's retirement in 1704, Secretary at War became a political office. In political terms, it was a fairly minor government job (despite retaining a continued right of access to the monarch) which dealt with the minutiae of administration, rather than grand strategy. The Secretary, who was usually a member of the House of Commons, routinely presented the House with the Army Estimates, and occasionally spoke on other military matters as required. In symbolic terms, he was seen as signifying parliamentary control over the Army. Issues of strategic policy during wartime were managed by the
Northern
and
Southern Departments
(the predecessors of today's
Foreign Office
and
Home Office
).
[4]
From 1704 to 1855, the job of Secretary remained occupied by a minister of the second rank (although he was occasionally part of the Cabinet after 1794).  Many of his responsibilities were transferred to the
Secretary of State for War
after the creation of that more senior post in 1794 (though the latter was also responsible for Britain's colonies from 1801, and renamed
Secretary of State for War and the Colonies
, an arrangement which only ceased with the establishment of the
Colonial Office
in 1854).
[5]
From 1824, the
British Empire
(excepting
India
, which was administered separately by the
East India Company
and then the
India Office
) was divided by the War and Colonial Office into the following administrative departments:
[6]
NORTH AMERICA
Upper Canada
,
Lower Canada
New Brunswick
,
Nova Scotia
,
Prince Edward Island

MEDITERRANEAN AND AFRICA
Malta
Gibraltar
Ionian Islands
Sierra Leone
and the West African Forts, Consulates to the
Barbary States
EASTERN COLONIES
New South Wales
Van Dieman's Land
Ceylon
Mauritius
The War Office, after 1854 and until the 1867
confederation
of the
Dominion of Canada
, was to split the military administration of the British Empire much as the War and Colonial Office had:

In February 1855, the new Secretary of State for War was additionally commissioned as Secretary at War, thus giving the Secretary of State oversight of the War Office in addition to his own department.  The same procedure was followed for each of his successors, until the office of Secretary at War was abolished altogether in 1863.
[9]
In 1855, the
Board of Ordnance
was abolished as a result of its perceived poor performance during the
Crimean War
.  This powerful independent body, dating from the 15th century, had been directed by the
Master-General of the Ordnance
, usually a very senior military officer who (unlike the Secretary at War) was often a member of the Cabinet.  The disastrous campaigns of the Crimean War resulted in the consolidation of all administrative duties in 1855 as subordinate to the Secretary of State for War, a Cabinet job.
[10]
He was not, however, solely responsible for the Army; the Commander-in-Chief had a virtually equal degree of responsibility.  This was reduced in theory by
the reforms
introduced by
Edward Cardwell
in 1870, which subordinated the Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary for War. In practice, however, a large influence was retained by the conservative Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal
Prince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge
, who held the post between 1856 and 1895. His resistance to reform caused military efficiency to lag well behind that of Britain's rivals, a problem that became obvious during the
Second Boer War
. The situation was only remedied in 1904, when the job of Commander-in-Chief was abolished, and replaced with that of the
Chief of the General Staff
, which was replaced by the job of
Chief of the Imperial General Staff
in 1908.  An
Army Council
was created with a format similar to that of the
Board of Admiralty
, directed by the Secretary of State for War, and an
Imperial General Staff
was established to coordinate Army administration. The creation of the Army Council was recommended by the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee, and formally appointed by
Letters Patent
dated 8 February 1904, and by
Royal Warrant
dated 12 February 1904.
[11]
The management of the War Office was hampered by persistent disputes between the civilian and military parts of the organisation. The government of
H.H. Asquith
attempted to resolve this during the
First World War
by appointing
Lord Kitchener
as Secretary for War.
[12]
During his tenure, the
Imperial General Staff
was virtually dismantled. Its role was replaced effectively by the
Committee of Imperial Defence
, which debated broader military issues.
[13]
The War Office decreased greatly in importance after the First World War, a fact illustrated by the drastic reductions of its staff numbers during the inter-war period. Its responsibilities and funding were also reduced. In 1936, the government of
Stanley Baldwin
appointed a Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, who was not part of the War Office. When
Winston Churchill
became Prime Minister in 1940, he bypassed the War Office altogether, and appointed himself Minister of Defence (though there was, curiously, no
ministry
of defence
until 1947).
[14]
Clement Attlee
continued this arrangement when he came to power in 1945, but appointed a separate Minister of Defence for the first time in 1947. In 1964, the present form of the
Ministry of Defence
was established, unifying the War Office, Admiralty, and Air Ministry.
[15]
The Old War Office building
[
edit
]
View of the former War Office building from Whitehall.
The former War Office building facing
Horse Guards Avenue
.
As early as 1718 letters from the Secretary at War were addressed from "The War Office". His department had several headquarters in London until it settled at
Horse Guards
in
Whitehall
during 1722. It remained there until 1858. Then, following the dissolution of the Board of Ordnance, the War Office moved into the Board's former offices in
Cumberland House
,
Pall Mall
. Over the ensuing years it expanded into adjacent properties on Pall Mall before it was relocated to purpose-built accommodation, in what is now known as the Old War Office Building, in 1906.
[16]
Between 1906 and its abolition in 1964 the War Office was based in a large
neo-Baroque
building designed by
William Young
, completed during 1906, and located on Horse Guards Avenue at its junction with
Whitehall
in Central London. The construction of the building required five years to complete, at a cost of more than 1.2 million pounds.
[17]
The building is somewhat oddly shaped, forming a
trapezoid
in order to maximise the use of the irregularly shaped plot of land on which it was built: its four distinctive domes were designed as a decorative means of disguising the shape.
[17]
It has around 1,100 rooms on seven floors.
[18]
After 1964 the building continued to be used, under the name The Old War Office, by the
Ministry of Defence
.
[17]
On 1 June 2007 the building, other than the steps that give access to it, was designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the
Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005
. The effect was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to
trespass
on the building.
[19]
In August 2013 it was announced that the building would be sold on the open market, with a goal of realising offers above 100 million pounds.
[20]
On 13 December 2014 the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the building would be sold to the
Hinduja Group
for an undisclosed amount.
[21]
The building was sold on 1 March 2016 for more than 350 million pounds, on a 250-year lease, to the Hinduja Group and OHL Developments for conversion to a luxury hotel and residential apartments.
[18]
Hinduja and Raffles plan to open the hotel in the building, the Raffles London at the OWO, on 29 September 2023.

Angelos Evert
(
Greek
:
Άγγελος Έβερτ
;
German
:
Ewert
; 10 April 1894 - 30 December 1970) was a Greek police officer, most notable for serving as head of the
Athens
branch of the
Cities Police
during the
Axis Occupation of Greece
during
World War II
.
Biography
[
edit
]
He was born in Athens, the son of the
Gendarmerie
Major Miltiadis Evert. His family was of
Bavarian
origin, having come to Greece with its first king, the Bavarian prince
Otto
.  After Law studies in the
University of Athens
, Angelos Evert joined the
Gendarmerie
as an officer in September 1915. He was transferred to the Cities Police in 1929, and became Police Commissioner of the Athens branch in September 1941, a few months after the country was
overrun
by the Germans.
During the course of the occupation, Evert and the German
Sicherheitsdienst
jointly provided protection to illegal casinos and gambling establishments operating throughout the country. Both received
kickbacks
for their services while the lion's share of the profits were used to pay the salaries of collaborationist spies. Following the end of the occupation Evert assisted the authorities in the capture and imprisonment of 48 underground casino owners.
[1]
Over the next few years he was active in several fronts, supporting the
Resistance

Greek government in exile

He also participated in the rescue of several Jewish families from Athens, for which he was later honoured as a "
Righteous among the Nations

EAM
demonstration in central Athens, triggering the
Dekemvriana
clashes.

New Democracy
party, and served as
Mayor of Athens
in 1987-1989 and President of New Democracy in 1993-1997.
Throughout his career, he received numerous medals and commendations, including the
Legion of Honour

England
became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, as the discovery of stone tools and footprints at
Happisburgh
in Norfolk have indicated.
[1]
The earliest evidence for early modern humans in
Northwestern Europe
, a jawbone discovered in Devon at
Kents Cavern
in 1927, was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old.
[2]
Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see
Creswellian
), at the end of the
Last Glacial Period
. The region has numerous remains from the
Mesolithic
,
Neolithic
and
Bronze Age
, such as
Stonehenge
and
Avebury
. In the
Iron Age
, all of Britain south of the
Firth of Forth
was inhabited by the
Celtic
people known as the
Britons
, including some
Belgic
tribes (e.g. the
Atrebates
, the
Catuvellauni
, the
Trinovantes
, etc.) in the south east. In AD 43 the
Roman conquest of Britain
began; the
Romans
maintained control of their
province of Britannia
until the early 5th century.
The
end of Roman rule in Britain
facilitated the
Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
, which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the
English people
. The
Anglo-Saxons
, a collection of various
Germanic peoples
, established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England and parts of southern
Scotland
.
[3]
They introduced the
Old English
language, which largely displaced the previous
Brittonic language
. The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in western Britain and the
Hen Ogledd
(Old North; the
Brittonic
-speaking parts of northern Britain), as well as with each other. Raids by
Vikings
became frequent after about AD 800, and the
Norsemen
settled in large parts of what is now England. During this period, several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, an effort that led to the emergence of the
Kingdom of England
by the 10th century.
In 1066, a
Norman expedition invaded and conquered England
. The
Norman dynasty
, established by
William the Conqueror
, ruled England for over half a century before the period of succession crisis known as
the Anarchy
(1135-1154). Following the Anarchy, England came under the rule of the
House of Plantagenet
, a dynasty which later inherited claims to the
Kingdom of France
. During this period,
Magna Carta
was signed. A succession crisis in France led to the
Hundred Years' War
(1337-1453), a series of conflicts involving the peoples of both nations. Following the Hundred Years' Wars, England became embroiled in its own succession wars. The
Wars of the Roses
pitted two branches of the House of Plantagenet against one another, the
House of York
and the
House of Lancaster
. The Lancastrian
Henry Tudor
ended the War of the Roses and established the
Tudor dynasty
in 1485.
Under the Tudors and the later
Stuart dynasty
, England became a colonial power. During the rule of the Stuarts, the
English Civil War
took place between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists, which resulted in
the execution
of
King Charles I
(1649) and the establishment of a series of republican governments—first, a Parliamentary republic known as the
Commonwealth of England
(1649-1653), then a military dictatorship under
Oliver Cromwell
known as
the Protectorate
(1653-1659). The Stuarts returned to the restored throne in 1660, though continued questions over religion and power resulted in the deposition of another Stuart king,
James II
, in the
Glorious Revolution
(1688). England, which had subsumed Wales in the 16th century under Henry VIII, united with Scotland in 1707 to form a new sovereign state called
Great Britain
.
[4]
[5]
[6]
Following the
Industrial Revolution
, which started in England, Great Britain ruled a colonial
Empire
, the largest in recorded history. Following a process of
decolonisation
in the 20th century, mainly caused by the weakening of Great Britain's power in the two World Wars; almost all of the empire's overseas territories became independent countries.

Stone Age
[

Main article:
Neolithic British Isles
Stonehenge
, erected in several stages from c.3000-2500 BC
The time from Britain's first inhabitation until the
Last Glacial Maximum
is known as the Old Stone Age, or
Palaeolithic era
. Archaeological evidence indicates that what was to become England was colonised by humans long before the rest of the British Isles because of its more hospitable climate between and during the various
glacial periods
of the distant past. This earliest evidence, from Happisburgh in Norfolk, includes the oldest hominid footprints found outside Africa, and points to dates of more than 800,000
RCYBP
.
[1]
These earliest inhabitants were
hunter-gatherers
. Low sea-levels meant that Britain was attached to the continent for much of this earliest period of history, and varying temperatures over tens of thousands of years meant that it was not always inhabited.
[7]
Silbury Hill
, c. 2400 BC
England has been continuously inhabited since the last Ice Age ended around 9000 BC, the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, or
Mesolithic era
. Rising sea-levels cut off Britain from the continent for the last time around 6500 BC. The population by then, as in the rest of the world, was exclusively
anatomically modern humans
, and the evidence suggests that their societies were increasingly complex and they were manipulating their environment and prey in new ways, possibly selective burning of then omnipresent woodland to create clearings for herds to gather and then hunt them. Hunting was mainly done with simple projectile weapons such as
javelin
and possibly
sling
. Bow and arrow was known in Western Europe since at least 9000 BC. The climate continued to warm and the population probably rose.
[8]
The New Stone Age, or
Neolithic era
, began with the introduction of farming, ultimately from the Middle East, around 4000 BC. It is not known whether this was caused by a substantial folk movement or native adoption of foreign practices or both. People began to lead a more settled lifestyle. Monumental collective tombs were built for the dead in the form of chambered cairns and long barrows. Towards the end of the period, other kinds of monumental stone alignments begin to appear, such as Stonehenge; their cosmic alignments show a preoccupation with the sky and planets. Flint technology produced a number of highly artistic pieces as well as purely pragmatic. More extensive woodland clearance was done for fields and pastures. The
Sweet Track
in the
Somerset Levels
is one of the oldest
timber trackways
known in Northern Europe and among the oldest roads in the world, dated by
dendrochronology
to the winter of 3807-3806 BC; it too is thought to have been a primarily religious structure.
[7]
Archaeological evidence from
North Yorkshire
indicates that salt was being manufactured there in the Neolithic.

The
Bronze Age
began around 2500 BC with the appearance of bronze objects. This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic
Bell Beaker culture
, following migration of new people from the continent. According to Olalde et al. (2018), after 2500 BC Britain's Neolithic population was largely replaced by this new Bell Beaker population, that was genetically related to the
Corded Ware culture
of central and eastern Europe and the
Yamnaya culture
of the eastern European
Pontic-Caspian Steppe
.
[10]
[11]
While the migration of these Beaker peoples must have been accompanied by a language shift, the Celtic languages were probably introduced by later Celtic migrations.
[12]
The Bronze Age saw a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise of increasingly powerful elites whose power came from their prowess as hunters and warriors and their controlling the flow of precious resources to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, many examples of very fine metalwork began to be deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive change in emphasis from the sky to the earth, as a rising population put increasing pressure on the land. England largely became bound up with the
Atlantic trade system
, which created a cultural continuum over a large part of Western Europe.
[13]
It is possible that the
Celtic languages
developed or spread to England as part of this system; by the end of the Iron Age there is much evidence that they were spoken across all England and western parts of Britain.

[15]
The
Iron Age
is conventionally said to begin around 800 BC. At this time, the
Britons
or Celtic Britons were settled in England. The Celtic people of early England were the majority of the population, beside other smaller ethnic groups in Great Britain. They existed like this from the British Iron Age into the Middle Ages, when it was
overtaken
by Germanic
Anglo-Saxons
. After some time, the
Celtic Britons
diverged into the multiple distinct ethnic groups such as Welsh, Cornish and Breton, but they were still tied by language, religion and culture. They spoke the Brittonic language, a Celtic language which is the ancestor of the modern Brittonic languages. The Atlantic system had by this time effectively collapsed, although England maintained contacts across the channel with France, as the
Hallstatt culture
became widespread across the country. Its continuity suggests it was not accompanied by substantial movement of population; crucially, only a single Hallstatt burial is known from Britain, and even here the evidence is inconclusive. On the whole, burials largely disappear across England, and the dead were disposed of in a way which is archaeologically invisible:
excarnation
is a widely cited possibility.
Hillforts
were known since the Late Bronze Age, but a huge number were constructed during 600-400 BC, particularly in the South, while after about 400 BC new forts were rarely built and many ceased to be regularly inhabited, while a few forts become more and more intensively occupied, suggesting a degree of regional centralisation.

Around this time the earliest mentions of Britain appear in the annals of history. The first historical mention of the region is from the
Massaliote Periplus
, a sailing manual for merchants thought to date to the 6th century BC, and
Pytheas
of
Massilia
wrote of his voyage of discovery to the island around 325 BC. Both of these texts are now lost; although quoted by later writers, not enough survives to inform the archaeological interpretation to any significant degree.
Britain, we are told, is inhabited by tribes which are autochthonous and preserve in their ways of living the ancient manner of life. They use chariots, for instance, in their wars, even as tradition tells us the old Greek heroes did in the Trojan War.

Contact with the continent was less than in the Bronze Age but still significant. Goods continued to move to England, with a possible hiatus around 350 to 150 BC. There were a few armed invasions of hordes of migrating Celts. There are two known invasions. Around 300 BC, a group from the Gaulish
Parisii
tribe apparently took over East Yorkshire, establishing the highly distinctive
Arras culture
. And from around 150-100 BC, groups of Belgae began to control significant parts of the South.
Bronze coins of
Cunobelin
, called "King of the Britons" by
Suetonius
. 1-42 AD.
These invasions constituted movements of a few people who established themselves as a warrior elite atop existing native systems, rather than replacing them. The Belgic invasion was much larger than the Parisian settlement, but the continuity of pottery style shows that the native population remained in place. Yet, it was accompanied by significant socio-economic change. Proto-urban, or even urban settlements, known as
oppida
, begin to eclipse the old hillforts, and an elite whose position is based on battle prowess and the ability to manipulate resources re-appears much more distinctly.
[17]
In 55 and 54 BC,
Julius Caesar
, as part of
his campaigns in Gaul
,
invaded Britain
and claimed to have scored a number of victories, but he never penetrated further than Hertfordshire and could not establish a province. However, his invasions mark a turning-point in British history. Control of trade, the flow of resources and prestige goods, became ever more important to the elites of Southern Britain; Rome steadily became the biggest player in all their dealings, as the provider of great wealth and patronage. In retrospect, a full-scale invasion and annexation was inevitable.

After Caesar's expeditions, the Romans began a serious and sustained attempt to
conquer Britain
in AD 43, at the behest of Emperor
Claudius
. They landed in Kent with four legions and defeated two armies led by the kings of the
Catuvellauni
tribe,
Caratacus
and
Togodumnus
, in battles at the Medway and the Thames. Togodumnus was killed, and Caratacus fled to Wales. The Roman force, led by
Aulus Plautius
, waited for Claudius to come and lead the final march on the Catuvellauni capital at
Camulodunum
(modern
Colchester
), before he returned to Rome for his triumph. The Catuvellauni held sway over most of the southeastern corner of England; eleven local rulers surrendered, a number of client kingdoms were established, and the rest became a Roman province with Camulodunum as its capital.
[19]
Over the next four years, the territory was consolidated and the future emperor
Vespasian
led a campaign into the Southwest where he subjugated two more tribes. By AD 54 the border had been pushed back to the Severn and the Trent, and campaigns were underway to subjugate Northern England and Wales.
But in AD 60, under the leadership of the warrior-queen
Boudicca
, the tribes rebelled against the Romans. At first, the rebels had great success. They burned Camulodunum,
Londinium
and
Verulamium
(modern-day Colchester, London and St. Albans respectively) to the ground. There is some archaeological evidence that the same happened at Winchester. The Second Legion
Augusta
, stationed at
Exeter
, refused to move for fear of revolt among the locals. Londinium governor
Suetonius Paulinus
evacuated the city before the rebels sacked and burned it; the fire was so hot that a ten-inch layer of melted red clay remains 15 feet below London's streets.
[20]
In the end, the rebels were said to have killed 70,000 Romans and Roman sympathisers. Paulinus gathered what was left of the Roman army. In the
decisive battle
, 10,000 Romans faced nearly 100,000 warriors somewhere along the line of
Watling Street
, at the end of which Boudicca was utterly defeated. It was said that 80,000 rebels were killed, but only 400 Romans.
Over the next 20 years, the borders expanded slightly, but the governor Agricola incorporated into the province the last pockets of independence in Wales and Northern England. He also led a campaign into Scotland which was recalled by Emperor Domitian. The border gradually formed along the
Stanegate
road in Northern England, solidified by
Hadrian's Wall
built in AD 138, despite temporary forays into Scotland.
The Romans and their culture stayed in charge for 350 years.
Traces of their presence
are ubiquitous throughout England.

In the wake of the breakdown of Roman rule in Britain from the middle of the fourth century, present day England was progressively settled by
Germanic
groups. Collectively known as the
Anglo-Saxons
, these included
Angles
,
Saxons
,
Jutes
and
Frisians
. The
Battle of Deorham
was critical in establishing Anglo-Saxon rule in 577.
[21]
Saxon mercenaries existed in Britain since before the late Roman period, but the main influx of population probably happened after the fifth century. The precise nature of these invasions is not fully known; there are doubts about the legitimacy of historical accounts due to a lack of archaeological finds.
Gildas
'
De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae
, composed in the 6th century, states that when the Roman army departed the Isle of Britannia in the 4th century AD, the indigenous Britons were invaded by
Picts
, their neighbours to the north (now Scotland) and the
Scots
(now Ireland). Britons invited the
Saxons
to the island to repel them but after they vanquished the Scots and Picts, the Saxons turned against the Britons.
Kingdoms and tribes in
Britain
, c. AD 600
The epic poem
Beowulf
, set in 6th century Scandinavia, composed c. 700-1000 AD.
Seven kingdoms are traditionally identified as being established by these migrants. Three were clustered in the South east:
Sussex
,
Kent
and
Essex
. The Midlands were dominated by the kingdoms of
Mercia
and
East Anglia
. To the north was
Northumbria
which unified two earlier kingdoms,
Bernicia
and
Deira
. Other smaller kingdoms seem to have existed as well, such as
Lindsey
in what is now Lincolnshire, and the
Hwicce
in the southwest. Eventually, the kingdoms were dominated by
Northumbria
and
Mercia
in the 7th century,
Mercia
in the 8th century and then
Wessex
in the 9th century.
Northumbria
eventually extended its control north into
Scotland
and west into
Wales
. It also subdued
Mercia
whose first powerful King,
Penda
, was killed by
Oswy
in 655. Northumbria's power began to wane after 685 with the defeat and death of its king
Aegfrith
at the hands of the
Picts
. Mercian power reached its peak under the rule of
Offa
, who from 785 had influence over most of Anglo-Saxon England. Since Offa's death in 796, the supremacy of
Wessex
was established under
Egbert
who extended control west into
Cornwall
before defeating the Mercians at the
Battle of Ellendun
in 825. Four years later, he received submission and tribute from the Northumbrian king,
Eanred
.
[22]
Since so few contemporary sources exist, the events of the fifth and sixth centuries are difficult to ascertain. As such, the nature of the Anglo-Saxon settlements is debated by historians, archaeologists and linguists. The traditional view, that the Anglo-Saxons drove the Romano-British inhabitants out of what is now England, was subject to reappraisal in the later twentieth century. One suggestion is that the invaders were smaller in number, drawn from an elite class of male warriors that gradually acculturated the natives.
[23]
[24]
[25]
An emerging view is that the scale of the Anglo-Saxon settlement varied across England, and that as such it cannot be described by any one process in particular. Mass migration and population shift seem to be most applicable in the core areas of settlement such as East Anglia and Lincolnshire,
[26]
[27]
[28]
[29]
[30]
while in more peripheral areas to the northwest, much of the native population likely remained in place as the incomers took over as elites.
[31]
[32]
In a study of place names in northeastern England and southern Scotland, Bethany Fox concluded that Anglian migrants settled in large numbers in river valleys, such as those of the Tyne and the Tweed, with the Britons in the less fertile hill country becoming acculturated over a longer period. Fox interprets the process by which English came to dominate this region as "a synthesis of mass-migration and elite-takeover models."

Genetic markers of Anglo-Saxon migrations
[
edit
]
Main article:
Genetic history of the British Isles
Shoulder clasp from
Sutton Hoo
,  625 AD
Genetic testing has been used to find evidence of large scale immigration of
Germanic peoples
into England.
Weale
et al.
(2002)
found that English Y DNA data showed signs of a mass
Anglo-Saxon
immigration from the European continent, affecting 50%-100% of the male gene pool in central England. This was based on the similarity of the DNA collected from small English towns to that found in
Friesland
.
[34]
A 2003 study with samples coming from larger towns, found a large variance in amounts of continental "Germanic" ancestry in different parts of England.
[35]
In the study, such markers typically ranged from 20% and 45% in southern England, with East Anglia, the east Midlands, and Yorkshire having over 50%. North German and Danish genetic frequencies were indistinguishable, thus precluding any ability to distinguish between the genetic influence of the Anglo-Saxon source populations and the later, and better documented, influx of Danish Vikings.
[36]
The mean value of continental Germanic genetic input in this study was calculated at 54 per cent.
[37]
In response to arguments, such as those of
Stephen Oppenheimer
[38]
and
Bryan Sykes
, that the similarity between English and continental Germanic DNA could have originated from earlier prehistoric migrations, researchers have begun to use data collected from ancient burials to ascertain the level of Anglo-Saxon contribution to the modern English gene pool.
Two studies published in 2016, based on data collected from skeletons found in Iron Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon era graves in Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire, concluded that the ancestry of the modern English population contains large contributions from both Anglo-Saxon migrants and Romano-British natives.

, c. 720 AD
Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England began around 600 AD, influenced by
Celtic Christianity
from the northwest and the
Roman Catholic Church
from the southeast.
Augustine
, the first
Archbishop of Canterbury
, took office in 597. In 601, he baptised the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king,
Æthelberht of Kent
. The last
pagan
Anglo-Saxon king,
Penda of Mercia
, died in 655. The last pagan
Jutish
king,
Arwald
of the
Isle of Wight
was killed in 686. The
Anglo-Saxon mission
on the continent took off in the 8th century, leading to the Christianisation of practically all of the
Frankish Empire
by 800.
Throughout the 7th and 8th centuries, power fluctuated between the larger kingdoms.
Bede
records Æthelberht of Kent as being dominant at the close of the 6th century, but power seems to have shifted northwards to the kingdom of Northumbria, which was formed from the amalgamation of Bernicia and Deira.
Edwin of Northumbria
probably held dominance over much of Britain, though Bede's Northumbrian bias should be kept in mind. Due to succession crises, Northumbrian hegemony was not constant, and
Mercia
remained a very powerful kingdom, especially under Penda. Two defeats ended Northumbrian dominance: the Battle of the Trent in 679 against Mercia, and Nechtanesmere in 685 against the
Picts
.
[41]
The so-called "Mercian Supremacy" dominated the 8th century, though it was not constant. Aethelbald and
Offa
, the two most powerful kings, achieved high status; indeed, Offa was considered the overlord of south Britain by
Charlemagne
. His power is illustrated by the fact that he summoned the resources to build
Offa's Dyke
. However, a rising Wessex, and challenges from smaller kingdoms, kept Mercian power in check, and by the early 9th century the "Mercian Supremacy" was over.
This period has been described as the
Heptarchy
, though this term has now fallen out of academic use. The term arose because the seven kingdoms of
Northumbria
,
Mercia
,
Kent
,
East Anglia
,
Essex
,
Sussex
and
Wessex
were the main polities of south Britain. Other small kingdoms were also politically important across this period:
Hwicce
,
Magonsaete
,
Lindsey
and Middle Anglia.

Viking challenge and the rise of Wessex

England in 878
The first recorded landing of
Vikings
took place in 787 in
Dorsetshire
, on the south-west coast.
[43]
The first major attack in Britain was in 793 at
Lindisfarne
monastery as given by the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
. However, by then the Vikings were almost certainly well-established in
Orkney
and
Shetland
, and many other non-recorded raids probably occurred before this. Records do show the first Viking attack on
Iona
taking place in 794. The arrival of the Vikings (in particular the Danish
Great Heathen Army
) upset the political and social geography of Britain and Ireland. In 867
Northumbria
fell to the Danes;
East Anglia
fell in 869. Though
Wessex
managed to contain the Vikings by defeating them at
Ashdown
in 871, a second invading army landed, leaving the Saxons on a defensive footing. At much the same time,
Æthelred
, king of Wessex died and was succeeded by his younger brother
Alfred
. Alfred was immediately confronted with the task of defending Wessex against the Danes. He spent the first five years of his reign paying the invaders off. In 878, Alfred's forces were overwhelmed at Chippenham in a surprise attack.
[44]
The
Alfred Jewel
, late 9th century
It was only now, with the independence of Wessex hanging by a thread, that Alfred emerged as a great king. In May 878 he led a force that defeated the Danes at
Edington
. The victory was so complete that the Danish leader,
Guthrum
, was forced to accept Christian baptism and withdraw from
Mercia
. Alfred then set about strengthening the defences of Wessex, building a new navy—60 vessels strong. Alfred's success bought Wessex and Mercia years of peace and sparked economic recovery in previously ravaged areas.
[45]
Old Minster
cathedral, Winchester, in the 10th century
Alfred's success was sustained by his son
Edward
, whose decisive victories over the Danes in East Anglia in 910 and 911 were followed by a crushing victory at Tempsford in 917. These military gains allowed Edward to fully incorporate Mercia into his kingdom and add East Anglia to his conquests. Edward then set about reinforcing his northern borders against the Danish
kingdom of Northumbria
. Edward's rapid conquest of the English kingdoms meant Wessex received homage from those that remained, including
Gwynedd
in Wales and Scotland. His dominance was reinforced by his son
Æthelstan
, who extended the borders of Wessex northward, in 927 conquering the
Kingdom of York
and leading a land and naval invasion of
Scotland
. These conquests led to his adopting the title 'King of the English' for the first time.
The dominance and independence of England was maintained by the kings that followed. It was not until 978 and the accession of
Æthelred the Unready
that the Danish threat resurfaced. Two powerful Danish kings (
Harold Bluetooth
and later his son
Sweyn
) both launched devastating invasions of England. Anglo-Saxon forces were resoundingly defeated at
Maldon
in 991. More Danish attacks followed, and their victories were frequent. Æthelred's control over his nobles began to falter, and he grew increasingly desperate. His solution was to pay off the Danes: for almost 20 years he paid increasingly large sums to the Danish nobles to keep them from English coasts. These payments, known as
Danegelds
, crippled the English economy.
[46]
Æthelred
then made an alliance with
Normandy
in 1001 through marriage to the Duke's daughter
Emma
, in the hope of strengthening England. Then he made a great error: in 1002 he ordered the massacre of all the Danes in England. In response, Sweyn began a decade of devastating attacks on England. Northern England, with its sizable Danish population, sided with Sweyn. By 1013, London, Oxford, and Winchester had fallen to the Danes. Æthelred fled to
Normandy
and Sweyn seized the throne. Sweyn suddenly died in 1014, and Æthelred returned to England, confronted by Sweyn's successor,
Cnut
. However, in 1016, Æthelred also suddenly died. Cnut swiftly defeated the remaining Saxons, killing Æthelred's son
Edmund
in the process. Cnut seized the throne, crowning himself King of England.

Alfred of Wessex
died in 899 and was succeeded by his son
Edward the Elder
. Edward, and his brother-in-law
Æthelred
of (what was left of) Mercia, began a programme of expansion, building forts and towns on an Alfredian model. On Æthelred's death, his wife (Edward's sister)
Æthelflæd
ruled as "Lady of the Mercians" and continued expansion. It seems Edward had his son
Æthelstan
brought up in the Mercian court. On Edward's death, Æthelstan succeeded to the Mercian kingdom, and, after some uncertainty, Wessex.
Æthelstan continued the expansion of his father and aunt and was the first king to achieve direct rulership of what we would now consider England. The titles attributed to him in
charters
and on coins suggest a still more widespread dominance. His expansion aroused ill-feeling among the other kingdoms of Britain, and he defeated a combined Scottish-Viking army at the
Battle of Brunanburh
. However, the unification of England was not a certainty. Under Æthelstan's successors
Edmund
and
Eadred
the English kings repeatedly lost and regained control of Northumbria. Nevertheless,
Edgar
, who ruled the same expanse as Æthelstan, consolidated the kingdom, which remained united thereafter.

The
Norman Conquest
led to a profound change in the history of the English state. William ordered the compilation of the
Domesday Book
, a survey of the entire population and their lands and property for tax purposes, which reveals that within 20 years of the conquest the English ruling class had been almost entirely dispossessed and replaced by Norman landholders, who monopolised all senior positions in the government and the Church. William and his nobles spoke and conducted court in
Norman French
, in both Normandy and England. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy endured for centuries and left an indelible mark in the development of modern English.
Upon being crowned, on Christmas Day 1066, William immediately began consolidating his power. By 1067, he faced revolts on all sides and spent four years crushing them. He then imposed his superiority over Scotland and Wales, forcing them to recognise him as overlord.
The English
Middle Ages
were characterised by
civil war
, international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread political intrigue among the aristocratic and monarchic elite. England was more than self-sufficient in cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. Its international economy was based on
wool trade
, in which wool from the
sheepwalks
of northern England was exported to the textile cities of
Flanders
, where it was worked into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was as much shaped by relations with the Flemish textile industry as it was by dynastic adventures in western France. An English textile industry was established in the 15th century, providing the basis for rapid English
capital accumulation
.

Henry I
, the fourth son of
William I the Conqueror
, succeeded his elder brother
William II
as
King of England
in 1100. Henry was also known as "Henry Beauclerc" because he received a formal education, unlike his older brother and
heir apparent
William
who got practical training to be king. Henry worked hard to reform and stabilise the country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and
Anglo-Norman
societies. The loss of his son,
William Adelin
, in the wreck of the
White Ship
in November 1120, undermined his reforms. This problem regarding succession cast a long shadow over English history.
Henry I had required the leading barons, ecclesiastics and officials in Normandy and England, to take an oath to accept
Matilda
(also known as Empress Maud, Henry I's daughter) as his heir. England was far less than enthusiastic to accept an outsider, and a woman, as their ruler.
There is some evidence that Henry was unsure of his own hopes and the oath to make Matilda his heir. Probably Henry hoped Matilda would have a son and step aside as Queen Mother. Upon Henry's death, the Norman and English barons ignored Matilda's claim to the throne, and thus through a series of decisions,
Stephen
, Henry's favourite nephew, was welcomed by many in England and Normandy as their new king.
Durham Cathedral
. The Norman cathedral was built 1093-1133
On 22 December 1135, Stephen was anointed king with implicit support by the church and nation. Matilda and her own son waited in France until she sparked the civil war from 1139 to 1153 known as
the Anarchy
. In the autumn of 1139, she invaded England with her illegitimate half-brother
Robert of Gloucester
. Her husband,
Geoffroy V of Anjou
, conquered Normandy but did not cross the channel to help his wife. During this breakdown of central authority, nobles built
adulterine castles
(i.e. castles erected without government permission), which were hated by the peasants, who were forced to build and maintain them.
Stephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from London. The war continued until 1148, when Matilda returned to France. Stephen reigned unopposed until his death in 1154, although his hold on the throne was uneasy. As soon as he regained power, he began to demolish the adulterine castles, but kept a few castles standing, which put him at odds with his heir. His contested reign,
civil war
, and lawlessness saw a major swing in power towards
feudal
barons
. In trying to appease Scottish and Welsh raiders, he handed over large tracts of land.

The first Angevins
[

Main article:
Angevin kings of England
Tomb of Richard I of England and Isabella of Angoulême
Empress Matilda and
Geoffrey
's son, Henry, resumed the invasion; he was already Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine when he landed in England. When Stephen's son and heir apparent
Eustace
died in 1153, Stephen made an agreement with Henry of
Anjou
(who became
Henry II
) to succeed Stephen and guarantee peace between them. The union was retrospectively named the
Angevin Empire
. Henry II destroyed the remaining adulterine castles and expanded his power through various means and to different levels into Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Flanders, Nantes, Brittany, Quercy, Toulouse, Bourges and Auvergne.
[48]
The reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power from the barony to the monarchical state in England; it was also to see a similar redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted legislation and a radical shift away from
feudalism
. In his reign, new
Anglo-Angevin
and
Anglo-Aquitanian
aristocracies developed, though not to the same degree as the
Anglo-Norman
once did, and the Norman nobles interacted with their French peers.
Henry's successor,
Richard I
"the Lion Heart" (also known as "the absent king"), was preoccupied with foreign wars, taking part in the
Third Crusade
, being captured while returning and pledging fealty to the
Holy Roman Empire
as part of his ransom, and defending his French territories against Philip II of France. His successor, his younger brother
John
, lost much of those territories including Normandy following the disastrous
Battle of Bouvines
in 1214, despite having in 1212 made the
Kingdom of England
a tribute-paying vassal of the
Holy See
, which it remained until the 14th century when the Kingdom rejected the overlordship of the Holy See and re-established its sovereignty.
From 1212 onwards, John had a constant policy of maintaining close relations with the Pope, which partially explains how he persuaded the Pope to reject the legitimacy of
Magna Carta
.

Over the course of his reign, a combination of higher taxes, unsuccessful wars and conflict with the Pope made King John unpopular with his barons. In 1215, some of the most important barons rebelled against him. He met their leaders along with their French and Scot allies at
Runnymede
, near London on 15 June 1215 to seal the Great Charter (
Magna Carta
in
Latin
), which imposed legal limits on the king's personal powers. But as soon as hostilities ceased, John received approval from the Pope to break his word because he had made it under duress. This provoked the
First Barons' War
and a French invasion by
Prince Louis of France
invited by a majority of the English barons to replace John as king in London in May 1216. John travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces, directing, among other operations, a two-month siege of the rebel-held
Rochester Castle
.
Henry III
[

]
Main article:
Henry III of England
John's son,
Henry III
, was only 9 years old when he became king (1216-1272). He spent much of his reign fighting the barons over
Magna Carta
[49]
and the royal rights, and was eventually forced to call the first "
parliament
" in 1264. He was also unsuccessful on the continent, where he endeavoured to re-establish English control over
Normandy
,
Anjou
, and
Aquitaine
.
His reign was punctuated by many rebellions and civil wars, often provoked by incompetence and mismanagement in government and Henry's perceived over-reliance on French courtiers (thus restricting the influence of the English nobility). One of these rebellions—led by a disaffected courtier,
Simon de Montfort
—was notable for its assembly of one of the earliest precursors to
Parliament
. In addition to fighting the
Second Barons' War
, Henry III made war against Louis IX and was defeated during the
Saintonge War
, yet Louis did not capitalise on his victory, respecting his opponent's rights.
Henry III's policies towards Jews began with relative tolerance, but became gradually more restrictive. In 1253 the
Statute of Jewry
, reinforced physical segregation and demanded a previously notional requirement to wear square white badges.
[50]
Henry III also backed an accusation of child murder in Lincoln, ordering a Jew Copin to be executed and 91 Jews to be arrested for trial; 18 were killed. Popular superstitious fears were fuelled, and Catholic theological hostility combined with Baronial abuse of loan arrangements, resulting in
Simon de Montfort
's supporters targeting of Jewish communities in their
revolt
. This hostility, violence and controversy was the background to the increasingly oppressive measures that followed under Edward I.

The reign of
Edward I
(reigned 1272-1307) was rather more successful. Edward enacted numerous laws strengthening the powers of his government, and he summoned the first officially sanctioned
Parliaments of England
(such as his
Model Parliament
). He
conquered Wales
and attempted to use a succession dispute to gain control of the
Kingdom of Scotland
, though this developed into a costly and drawn-out military campaign.
Edward I is also known for his policies first persecuting Jews, particularly the 1275
Statute of the Jewry
. This banned Jews from their previous role in making loans, and demanded that they work as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers. This was unrealistic, and failed.
[52]
Edward's solution was to
expel Jews from England

His son,

rather than jousting, hunting, or the usual entertainments of kings, he spent most of his reign trying in vain to control the nobility, who in return showed continual hostility to him. Meanwhile, the Scottish leader
Robert Bruce
began retaking all the territory conquered by Edward I. In 1314, the English army was disastrously defeated by the Scots at the
Battle of Bannockburn
. Edward also showered favours on his companion
Piers Gaveston
, a knight of humble birth. While it has been widely believed that Edward was a homosexual because of his closeness to Gaveston, there is no concrete evidence of this. The king's enemies, including his cousin
Thomas of Lancaster
, captured and murdered Gaveston in 1312.
Edward's downfall came in 1326 when his wife,
Queen Isabella
, travelled to her native France and, with her lover
Roger Mortimer
,
invaded England
. Despite their tiny force, they quickly rallied support for their cause. The king fled London, and his companion since Piers Gaveston's death,
Hugh Despenser
, was publicly tried and executed. Edward was captured, charged with breaking his coronation oath,
deposed
and imprisoned in Gloucestershire until he was murdered some time in the autumn of 1327, presumably by agents of Isabella and Mortimer.
In 1315-1317, the Great Famine may have resulted in half a million deaths in England due to hunger and disease, more than 10 per cent of the population.

Edward III
, son of Edward II, was crowned at age 14 after his father was
deposed
by his mother and her
consort
Roger Mortimer
. At age 17, he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the
de facto
ruler of the country, and began his personal reign.
Edward III
reigned 1327-1377, restored royal authority and went on to transform England into the most efficient military power in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislature and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the
Black Death
. After defeating, but not subjugating, the
Kingdom of Scotland
, he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1338, but his claim was denied due to the
Salic law
. This started what would become known as the
Hundred Years' War
.
[56]
Following some initial setbacks, the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at
Crécy
and
Poitiers
led to the highly favourable
Treaty of Brétigny
. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.
For many years, trouble had been brewing with
Castile
—a Spanish kingdom whose navy had taken to raiding English merchant ships in the
Channel
. Edward won a
major naval victory
against a Castilian fleet off
Winchelsea
in 1350.
[57]
Although the Castilian crossbowmen killed many of the enemy,
[58]
the English gradually got the better of the encounter. In spite of Edward's success, however, Winchelsea was only a flash in a conflict that raged between the English and the Spanish for over 200 years,
[59]
coming to a head with the defeat of the
Spanish Armada
in 1588.
[60]
In 1373, England signed an
alliance with the Kingdom of Portugal
, which is claimed to be the oldest alliance in the world still in force.
Edward III died of a stroke on  21 June 1377, and was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson,
Richard II
. He married
Anne of Bohemia
, daughter of
Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor
in 1382, and ruled until he was deposed by his first cousin
Henry IV
in 1399.
In 1381, a
Peasants' Revolt
led by
Wat Tyler
spread across large parts of England. It was suppressed by  Richard II, with the death of 1500 rebels.
Black Death
[
edit
]
Main article:
Black Death in England
The Black Death
, an epidemic of
bubonic plague
that spread all over Europe, arrived in England in 1348 and killed as much as a third to half the population. Military conflicts during this period were usually with domestic neighbours such as the Welsh, Irish, and Scots, and included the
Hundred Years' War
against the French and their
Scottish
allies. Notable English victories in the Hundred Years' War included
Crécy
and
Agincourt
. The final defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince,
Owain Glyndŵr
, in 1412 by Prince Henry (who later became
Henry V
) represents the last major armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.
Edward III
gave land to powerful noble families, including many people of royal lineage. Because land was equivalent to power, these powerful men could try to claim the crown. When Edward III died in 1376, he was succeeded by his grandson,
Richard II
.  Richard's autocratic and arrogant methods  only served to alienate the nobility more, and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by
Henry IV
increased the turmoil.
Henry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts.
Rebellions continued throughout the first ten years of Henry's reign, including the revolt of
Owain Glyndŵr
, who declared himself
Prince of Wales
in 1400, and the rebellion of
Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland
. The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son,
Henry of Monmouth
,
[61]
who later became king (though the son managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410).

Henry V
succeeded to the throne in 1413. He renewed hostilities with France and began a set of military campaigns which are considered a new phase of the
Hundred Years' War
, referred to as the
Lancastrian War
. He won several notable victories over the French, including the
Battle of Agincourt
. In the
Treaty of Troyes
, Henry V was given the power to succeed the current ruler of France,
Charles VI of France
. The Treaty also provided that he would marry Charles VI's daughter,
Catherine of Valois
. They married in 1421. Henry died of dysentery in 1422, leaving a number of unfulfilled plans, including his plan to take over as King of France and to lead a crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Muslims.
Henry V's son,
Henry VI
, became king in 1422 as an infant. His reign was marked by constant turmoil due to his political weaknesses. While he was growing up, England was ruled by the
Regency government
.
The Regency Council tried to install Henry VI as the King of France, as provided by the Treaty of Troyes signed by his father, and led English forces to take over areas of France. It appeared they might succeed due to the poor political position of the son of Charles VI, who had claimed to be the rightful king as
Charles VII of France
. However, in 1429,
Joan of Arc
began a military effort to prevent the English from gaining control of France. The French forces regained control of French territory.
In 1437, Henry VI came of age and began to actively rule as king. To forge peace, he married French noblewoman
Margaret of Anjou
in 1445, as provided in the
Treaty of Tours
. Hostilities with France resumed in 1449. When England lost the
Hundred Years' War
in August 1453, Henry fell into mental breakdown until Christmas 1454.
Henry could not control the feuding nobles, and a series of civil wars known as the
Wars of the Roses
began, lasting from 1455 to 1485. Although the fighting was very sporadic and small, there was a general breakdown in the power of the Crown. The royal court and Parliament moved to Coventry, in the Lancastrian heartlands, which thus became the capital of England until 1461. Henry's cousin
Edward, Duke of York
, deposed Henry in 1461 to become Edward IV following a
Lancastrian
defeat at the
Battle of Mortimer's Cross
. Edward was later briefly expelled from the throne in 1470-1471 when
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick
, brought Henry back to power. Six months later, Edward defeated and killed Warwick in battle and reclaimed the throne. Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London and died there.
Edward died in 1483, only 40 years old, his reign having gone a little way to restoring the power of the Crown. His eldest son and heir
Edward V
, aged 12, could not succeed him because the king's brother,
Richard III, Duke of Gloucester
, declared Edward IV's marriage bigamous, making all his children illegitimate. Richard III was then declared king, and Edward V and his 10-year-old brother Richard were
imprisoned
in the Tower of London. The two were never seen again. It was widely believed that Richard III had them murdered and he was reviled as a treacherous fiend, which limited his ability to govern during his brief reign. In summer 1485,
Henry Tudor
, the last Lancastrian male, returned from exile in France and landed in Wales. Henry then defeated and killed Richard III at
Bosworth Field
on 22 August, and was crowned Henry VII.

Henry VII
[
edit
]
With
Henry VII
's accession to the throne in 1485, the Wars of the Roses came to an end, and Tudors would continue to rule England for 118 years. Traditionally, the
Battle of Bosworth Field
is considered to mark the end of the Middle Ages in England, although Henry did not introduce any new concept of monarchy, and for most of his reign his hold on power was tenuous. He claimed the throne by conquest and God's judgement in battle. Parliament quickly recognised him as king, but the Yorkists were far from defeated. Nonetheless, he married Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth in January 1486, thereby uniting the houses of York and Lancaster.
Most of the European rulers did not believe Henry would survive long, and were thus willing to shelter claimants against him. The first plot against him was the
Stafford and Lovell rebellion
of 1486, which presented no serious threat. But Richard III's nephew
John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln
, hatched another attempt the following year. Using a peasant boy named
Lambert Simnel
, who posed as
Edward, Earl of Warwick
(the real Warwick was locked up in the Tower of London), he led an army of 2,000 German mercenaries paid for by
Margaret of Burgundy
into England. They were defeated and de la Pole was killed at the difficult
Battle of Stoke
, where the loyalty of some of the royal troops to Henry was questionable. The king, realizing that Simnel was a dupe, employed him in the royal kitchen.
A more serious threat was
Perkin Warbeck
, a Flemish youth who posed as Edward IV's son Richard. Again with support from Margaret of Burgundy, he invaded England four times from 1495 to 1497 before he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Both Warbeck and the Earl of Warwick were dangerous even in captivity, and Henry executed them in 1499 before Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain would allow their daughter Catherine to come to England and marry his son Arthur.
In 1497, Henry defeated Cornish rebels marching on London. The rest of his reign was relatively peaceful, despite worries about succession after the death of his wife
Elizabeth of York
in 1503.
Henry VII's foreign policy was peaceful. He had made an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor
Maximilian I
, but in 1493, when they went to war with France, England was dragged into the conflict. Impoverished and his hold on power insecure, Henry had no desire for war. He quickly reached an understanding with the French and renounced all claims to their territory except the port of Calais, realizing also that he could not stop them from incorporating the Duchy of Brittany. In return, the French agreed to recognize him as king and stop sheltering pretenders. Shortly afterwards, they became preoccupied with adventures in Italy. Henry also reached an understanding with Scotland, agreeing to marry his daughter Margaret to that country's king
James IV
.
Upon becoming king, Henry inherited a government severely weakened and degraded by the Wars of the Roses. The treasury was empty, having been drained by Edward IV's Woodville in-laws after his death. Through a tight fiscal policy and sometimes ruthless tax collection and confiscations, Henry refilled the treasury by the time of his death. He also effectively rebuilt the machinery of government.
In 1501, the king's son
Arthur
, having married
Catherine of Aragon
, died of illness at age 15, leaving his younger brother
Henry, Duke of York
as heir. When the king himself died in 1509, the position of the Tudors was secure at last, and his son succeeded him unopposed.
Henry VIII
[
edit
]
King
Henry VIII
Henry VIII
began his reign with much optimism. The handsome, athletic young king stood in sharp contrast to his wary, miserly father. Henry's lavish court quickly drained the treasury of the fortune he inherited. He married the widowed
Catherine of Aragon
, and they had several children, but none survived infancy except a daughter,
Mary
.
In 1512, the young king started a
war in France
. Although England was an ally of Spain, one of France's principal enemies, the war was mostly about Henry's desire for personal glory, despite his sister
Mary
being married to the French king
Louis XII
. The war accomplished little. The English army suffered badly from disease, and Henry was not even present at the one notable victory, the
Battle of the Spurs
. Meanwhile,
James IV of Scotland
(despite being Henry's other brother-in-law), activated his alliance with the French and declared war on England. While Henry was dallying in France, Catherine, who was serving as regent in his absence, and his advisers were left to deal with this threat. At the
Battle of Flodden
on 9 September 1513, the Scots were completely defeated. James and most of the Scottish nobles were killed. When Henry returned from France, he was given credit for the victory.
Eventually, Catherine was no longer able to have any more children. The king became increasingly nervous about the possibility of his daughter Mary inheriting the throne, as England's one experience with a female sovereign, Matilda in the 12th century, had been a catastrophe. He eventually decided that it was necessary to divorce Catherine and find a new queen. To persuade the Church to allow this, Henry cited the passage in the
Book of Leviticus
: "If a man taketh his brother's wife, he hath committed adultery; they shall be childless". However, Catherine insisted that she and Arthur never consummated their brief marriage and that the prohibition did not apply here. The timing of Henry's case was very unfortunate; it was 1527 and the Pope had been imprisoned by emperor
Charles V
, Catherine's nephew and the most powerful man in Europe, for siding with his archenemy
Francis I of France
. Because he could not divorce in these circumstances, Henry seceded from the Church, in what became known as the
English Reformation
.
The newly established
Church of England
amounted to little more than the existing Catholic Church, but led by the king rather than the Pope. It took a number of years for the separation from Rome to be completed, and many were executed for resisting the king's religious policies.
In 1530, Catherine was banished from court and spent the rest of her life (until her death in 1536) alone in an isolated manor home, barred from contact with Mary. Secret correspondence continued thanks to her ladies-in-waiting. Their marriage was declared invalid, making Mary an illegitimate child. Henry married
Anne Boleyn
secretly in January 1533, just as his divorce from Catherine was finalised. They had a second, public wedding. Anne soon became pregnant and may have already been when they wed. But on 7 September 1533, she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. The king was devastated at his failure to obtain a son after all the effort it had taken to remarry. Gradually, he came to develop a disliking of his new queen for her strange behaviour. In 1536, when Anne was pregnant again, Henry was badly injured in a jousting accident. Shaken by this, the queen gave birth prematurely to a stillborn boy. By now, the king was convinced that his marriage was hexed, and having already found a new queen, Jane Seymour, he put Anne in the Tower of London on charges of witchcraft. Afterwards, she was beheaded along with five men (her brother included) accused of adultery with her. The marriage was then declared invalid, so that Elizabeth, just like her half sister, became a bastard.
Henry immediately married
Jane Seymour
, who became pregnant almost as quickly. On 12 October 1537, she gave birth to a healthy boy, Edward, which was greeted with huge celebrations. However, the queen died of
puerperal sepsis
ten days later. Henry genuinely mourned her death, and at his own passing nine years later, he was buried next to her.
The king married a fourth time in 1540, to the German
Anne of Cleves
for a political alliance with her Protestant brother, the
Duke of Cleves
. He also hoped to obtain another son in case something should happen to Edward. Anne proved a dull, unattractive woman and Henry did not consummate the marriage. He quickly divorced her, and she remained in England as a kind of adopted sister to him. He married again, to a 19-year-old named
Catherine Howard
. But when it became known that she was neither a virgin at the wedding, nor a faithful wife afterwards, she ended up on the scaffold and the marriage declared invalid. His sixth and last marriage was to
Catherine Parr
, who was more his nursemaid than anything else, as his health was failing since his jousting accident in 1536.
In 1542, the king started a new campaign in France, but unlike in 1512, he only managed with great difficulty. He only conquered the city of Boulogne, which France retook in 1549. Scotland also declared war and at
Solway Moss
was again totally defeated.
Henry's paranoia and suspicion worsened in his last years. The number of executions during his 38-year reign numbered tens of thousands. His domestic policies had strengthened royal authority to the detriment of the aristocracy, and led to a safer realm, but his foreign policy adventures did not increase England's prestige abroad and wrecked royal finances and the national economy, and embittered the Irish.
[62]
He died in January 1547 at age 55 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VI.

Although he showed piety and intelligence,
Edward VI
was only nine years old when he became king in 1547.
[62]
His uncle,
Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset
tampered with
Henry VIII's will
and obtained
letters patent
giving him much of the power of a monarch by March 1547. He took the title of Protector. While some see him as a high-minded idealist, his stay in power culminated in a crisis in 1549 when many counties of the realm were up in protest.
Kett's Rebellion
in Norfolk and the
Prayer Book Rebellion
in
Devon
and
Cornwall
simultaneously created a crisis while invasion from Scotland and France were feared. Somerset, disliked by the Regency Council for being autocratic, was removed from power by
John Dudley
, who is known as
Lord President Northumberland
. Northumberland proceeded to adopt the power for himself, but he was more conciliatory and the Council accepted him. During Edward's reign England changed from being a Catholic nation to a Protestant one, in schism from Rome.
Edward showed great promise but fell violently ill of
tuberculosis
in 1553 and died that August, two months before his 16th birthday.
[62]
Northumberland made plans to place
Lady Jane Grey
on the throne and marry her to his son, so that he could remain the power behind the throne. His plot failed in a matter of days, Jane Grey was beheaded, and
Mary I
(1516-1558) took the throne amidst popular demonstration in her favour in London, which contemporaries described as the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary had never been expected to hold the throne, at least not since Edward was born. She was a devoted Catholic who believed that she could reverse the Reformation.
[63]
Returning England to Catholicism led to the burnings of 274 Protestants, which are recorded especially in
John Foxe
's
Book of Martyrs
. Mary then married her cousin
Philip
, son of
Emperor Charles V
, and King of Spain when Charles abdicated in 1556. The union was difficult because Mary was already in her late 30s and Philip was a Catholic and a foreigner, and so not very welcome in England. This wedding also provoked hostility from France, already at war with Spain and now fearing being encircled by the Habsburgs. Calais, the last English outpost on the Continent, was then taken by France. King Philip (1527-1598) had very little power, although he did protect Elizabeth. He was not popular in England, and spent little time there.
[64]
Mary eventually became pregnant, or at least believed herself to be. In reality, she may have had
uterine cancer
. Her death in November 1558 was greeted with huge celebrations in the streets of London.
Elizabeth I
[
edit
]
Main article:
Elizabethan era
Elizabeth I
After Mary I died in 1558,
Elizabeth I
came to the throne. Her reign restored a sort of order to the realm after the turbulent reigns of Edward VI and Mary I. The religious issue which had divided the country since Henry VIII was in a way put to rest by the
Elizabethan Religious Settlement
, which re-established the
Church of England
. Much of Elizabeth's success was in balancing the interests of the
Puritans
and Catholics; historian Robert Bucholz paraphrasing historian Conrad Russell, suggested that the genius of the Church of England was that it "thinks Protestant but looks Catholic."
[62]
She managed to offend neither to a large extent, although she clamped down on Catholics towards the end of her reign as war with Catholic Spain loomed.
[65]
[66]
Despite the need for an heir, Elizabeth declined to marry, despite offers from a number of suitors across Europe, including the Swedish king
Erik XIV
. This created endless worries over her succession, especially in the 1560s when she nearly died of smallpox. It has been often rumoured that she had a number of lovers (including
Francis Drake
), but there is no hard evidence.
Elizabeth maintained relative government stability. Apart from the
Revolt of the Northern Earls
in 1569, she was effective in reducing the power of the old nobility and expanding the power of her government. Elizabeth's government did much to consolidate the work begun under
Thomas Cromwell
in the reign of Henry VIII, that is, expanding the role of the government and effecting common law and administration throughout England. During the reign of Elizabeth and shortly afterwards, the population grew significantly: from three million in 1564 to nearly five million in 1616.
[67]
The queen ran afoul of her cousin
Mary, Queen of Scots
, who was a devoted Catholic and so was forced to abdicate her throne (Scotland had
recently become Protestant
). She fled to England, where Elizabeth immediately had her arrested. Mary spent the next 19 years in confinement, but proved too dangerous to keep alive, as the Catholic powers in Europe considered her the legitimate ruler of England. She was eventually tried for treason, sentenced to death, and beheaded in February 1587.

The Procession Picture,
c.
1600
, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers
The Elizabethan era was the epoch in English history of Queen
Elizabeth I
's reign (1558-1603). Historians often depict it as the
golden age
in English history. The symbol of
Britannia
was first used in 1572 and often thereafter to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the hated Spanish foe. In terms of the entire century, the historian
John Guy
(1988) argues that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the
Tudors
" than at any time in a thousand years.
[68]
This "golden age"
[69]
represented the apogee of the
English Renaissance
and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for
theatre
, as
William Shakespeare
and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant
Reformation
became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the
Spanish Armada
was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.
The Elizabethan Age is viewed so highly largely because of the periods before and after. It was a brief period of largely internal peace after the horrible violence and disorder of the
Wars of the Roses
, and battles between Catholics and Protestants during the
English Reformation
; and it preceded the violent turmoil of the
English Civil War
and battles between
parliament
and the monarchy during the 17th century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the
Elizabethan Religious Settlement
, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.
England was also well off compared to the other nations of Europe. The
Italian Renaissance
had ended due to foreign domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in religious battles until the
Edict of Nantes
in 1598. Also, the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent. Due to these reasons, the centuries long conflict with France was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign. England during this period had a centralised, organised and effective government, largely due to the reforms of
Henry VII
and
Henry VIII
. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of
trans-Atlantic
trade.
Sir Francis Drake's voyage 1585-86
In 1585 worsening relations between
Philip II of Spain
and Elizabeth erupted into war. Elizabeth signed the
Treaty of Nonsuch
with the Dutch and permitted
Francis Drake
to maraud in response to a Spanish embargo. Drake surprised
Vigo
, Spain, in October, then proceeded to the
Caribbean
and
sacked Santo Domingo
(the capital of Spain's American empire and the present-day capital of the Dominican Republic)
and Cartagena
(a large and wealthy port on the north coast of Colombia that was the centre of the silver trade). Philip II tried to invade England with the
Spanish Armada
in 1588 but was famously defeated.
The Armada was not just a naval campaign. The build-up of land forces to resist a Spanish invasion has been described as an administrative feat of massive scope. A survey taken in November and December 1587 showed 130,000 men in the militia, of whom 44,000 were members of the trained bands, being drilled and led by experienced captains and sergeants. By May 1588 the London bands were drilling weekly. To give warning of the enemy's approach, beacons were built, manned twenty-four hours a day by four men. Once the beacons were lit, 72,000 men could be mobilised on the south coast, with another 46,000 protecting London. For the many Englishmen caught up in the Armada the experience must have been very profound and frightening. Some shared the intimacy of beacon watching, hoping for the best, but ready to light their warning fires in case of the worst.

Foreign affairs
[
edit
]
In foreign policy, Elizabeth played against each other the major powers France and Spain, as well as the papacy and Scotland. These were all Catholic and each wanted to end Protestantism in England. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland. She risked war with Spain by supporting the "
Sea Dogs
", such as
Walter Raleigh
,
John Hawkins
and Sir
Francis Drake
, who preyed on Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. Drake himself became a hero—being the first
Englishman to circumnavigate the world
between 1577 and 1580, having plundered Spanish settlements and treasure ships. The
major war came with Spain, 1585-1603
. When Spain tried to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco, and the defeat of the
Spanish Armada
in 1588 associated Elizabeth's name with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in English history. Her enemies failed to combine and Elizabeth's foreign policy successfully navigated all the dangers.
[71]
End of Tudor era
[
edit
]
In all, the
Tudor period
is seen as a decisive one which set up many important questions which would have to be answered in the next century and during the
English Civil War
. These were questions of the relative power of the monarch and Parliament and to what extent one should control the other. Some historians think that Thomas Cromwell affected a "Tudor Revolution" in government, and it is certain that Parliament became more important during his chancellorship. Other historians argue that the "Tudor Revolution" extended to the end of Elizabeth's reign, when the work was all consolidated. Although the
Privy Council
declined after Elizabeth's death, it was very effective while she was alive.
Elizabeth died in 1603 at the age of 69.

King James I of England
When Elizabeth died, her closest male Protestant relative was the
King of Scots
,
James VI
, of the
House of Stuart
, who became King James I of England in a
Union of the Crowns
, called James I and VI. He was the first monarch to rule the entire island of Britain, but the countries remained separate politically. Upon taking power, James made peace with Spain, and for the first half of the 17th century, England remained largely inactive in European politics. Several assassination attempts were made on James, notably the
Main Plot
and
Bye Plots
of 1603, and most famously, on 5 November 1605, the
Gunpowder Plot
, by a group of Catholic conspirators, led by
Robert Catesby
, which caused more antipathy in England towards Catholicism.
Colonies

In 1607 England built an
establishment at Jamestown
. This was the beginning of colonialism by England in North America. Many English settled then in North America for religious or economic reasons. Approximately 70% of English immigrants to North America who came between 1630 and 1660 were
indentured servants
. By 1700,
Chesapeake
planters transported about 100,000 indentured servants,
[72]
who accounted for more than 75% of all European immigrants to Virginia and Maryland.

King Charles I
, who was beheaded in 1649
The
First English Civil War
broke out in 1642, largely due to ongoing conflicts between James' son,
Charles I
, and
Parliament
. The defeat of the Royalist army by the
New Model Army
of Parliament at the
Battle of Naseby
in June 1645 effectively destroyed the king's forces. Charles surrendered to the Scottish army at Newark. He was eventually handed over to the English Parliament in early 1647. He escaped, and the
Second English Civil War
began, but the New Model Army quickly secured the country. The capture and trial of Charles led to the
execution of Charles I
in January 1649 at
Whitehall
Gate in London, making England a republic. This shocked the rest of Europe. The king argued to the end that only God could judge him.
The New Model Army, commanded by
Oliver Cromwell
, then scored decisive victories against Royalist armies in Ireland and Scotland. Cromwell was given the title
Lord Protector
in 1653, making him 'king in all but name' to his critics. After he died in 1658, his son
Richard Cromwell
succeeded him in the office but he was forced to abdicate within a year. For a while it seemed as if a new civil war would begin as the New Model Army split into factions. Troops stationed in Scotland under the command of
George Monck
eventually marched on London to restore order.
According to
Derek Hirst
, outside of politics and religion, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterised by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialisation of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.

Restoration of the monarchy

King Charles II
The Great Fire London, 1666.
The monarchy was restored in 1660, with King
Charles II
returning to London. However, the power of the crown was less than before the Civil War. By the 18th century, England rivaled the Netherlands as one of the freest countries in Europe.
[75]
In 1665, London was swept by the
plague
, and in 1666 by the
Great Fire
for 5 days which destroyed about 15,000 buildings.
Glorious Revolution
[
edit
]
In 1680, the
Exclusion Crisis
consisted of attempts to prevent accession of James, heir to Charles II, because he was Catholic. After Charles II died in 1685 and his younger brother,
James II and VII
was crowned, various factions pressed for his Protestant daughter
Mary
and her husband
Prince William III of Orange
to replace him in what became known as the
Glorious Revolution
.
In November 1688, William
invaded England
and succeeded in being crowned. James tried to retake the throne in the
Williamite War
, but was defeated at the
Battle of the Boyne
in 1690.
In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the
Bill of Rights
, was passed.
[76]
The Bill, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier
Declaration of Right
, established restrictions on the
royal prerogative
. For example, the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments.
[77]
William was opposed to such constraints, but chose to avoid conflict with Parliament and agreed to the statute.
[78]
In parts of Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James remained determined to see him restored to the throne, and staged a series of bloody uprisings. As a result, any failure to pledge loyalty to the victorious King William was severely dealt with. The most infamous example of this policy was the
Massacre of Glencoe
in 1692.
Jacobite rebellions
continued into the mid-18th century until the son of the last Catholic claimant to the throne,
James III and VIII
, mounted a
final campaign in 1745
. The Jacobite forces of Prince
Charles Edward Stuart
, the "Bonnie Prince Charlie" of legend, were defeated at the
Battle of Culloden
in 1746.
Formation of Great Britain and the United Kingdom
[
edit
]
The
Acts of Union
between the
Kingdom of England
and the
Kingdom of Scotland
were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed by both parliaments in 1707, which dissolved them in order to form a
Kingdom of Great Britain
governed by a unified
Parliament of Great Britain
according to the
Treaty of Union
. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate independent states, with separate legislatures but
with the same monarch
, starting with James I of England (also James VI of Scotland)) into a single kingdom.
[79]
The two countries had shared a monarch since the
Union of the Crowns
in 1603, when
King James VI of Scotland
inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen
Elizabeth I
. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.
The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scots Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of Great Britain, based in the
Palace of Westminster
in London, the home of the English Parliament.
[80]
Hence, the Acts are referred to as the
Union of the Parliaments
. On the Union, historian
Simon Schama
said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."
[81]
In 1714 ended the reign of
Queen Anne
, the last monarch of the
House of Stuart
. She was succeeded by her
second cousin
,
George I
, of the
House of Hanover
, who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother,
Elizabeth
, daughter of
James VI & I
.
[82]
A series of
Jacobite rebellions
broke out in an attempt to restore the Stuart monarchy, but failed. Several
planned French invasions
were attempted, also with the intention of placing the Stuarts on the throne.
The first general laws against child labour, the
Factory Acts
, were passed in Britain in the first half of the 19th century. Children younger than nine were not allowed to work and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours.
[83]
The
Act of Union of 1800
formally assimilated Ireland within the British political process and from 1 January 1801 created a new
state
called the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
, which united Great Britain with the
Kingdom of Ireland
to form a single political entity. The English parliament at Westminster became the parliament of the Union.

Industrial Revolution
[

Main article:
Economic history of the United Kingdom
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, technological advances and mechanisation resulted in the
Industrial Revolution
which transformed a largely agrarian society and caused considerable social upheaval.
Economies of scale
and increased output per worker allowed steam-based factories to undercut production of traditional cottage industries. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in mortality, crime, and social deprivation. (Many Sunday schools for pre-working-age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each other's funeral arrangements.) The process of industrialisation threatened many livelihoods, which prompted some to sabotage factories. These saboteurs were known as "
Luddites
".

The
Local Government Act 1888
was the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England. The system was based on the existing counties (today known as the
historic counties
, since the major boundary changes of 1974). Later, the
Local Government Act 1894
created a second tier of local government. All administrative counties and county boroughs were divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration.
During the 1800s, the need for local administration greatly increased, prompting piecemeal adjustments. The sanitary districts and parish councils had legal status, but were not part of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers; often no-one could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. Furthermore, the increased "county business" could not be handled by the
quarter sessions
, nor was this appropriate. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. By 1888, these shortcomings were clear, and the
Local Government Act
was the first systematic attempt to create a standardised system of local government in England.
The system was based on the existing counties (now known as the
historic counties
, since the major boundary changes of 1974). The counties themselves had had some boundary changes in the preceding 50 years, mainly to remove enclaves and exclaves. The act called for the creation of statutory counties, based on the ancient/historic counties, but completely corrected for enclaves and exclaves, and adjusted so that each settlement was completely within one county. These statutory counties were to be used for non-administrative functions:
"
sheriff
,
lieutenant
,
custos rotulorum
, justices, militia, coroner, or other"
. With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.
The statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called 'administrative counties'. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus, 59 "counties in themselves", or 'county boroughs', were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties.
In 1894, the Local Government Act
created a second tier of local government. Henceforth, all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration. The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based on, and incorporated the
sanitary districts
which created in 1875 (with adjustments, so that districts did not overlap two counties).
The Act also provided for the establishment of
civil parishes
. The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of these responsibilities (others being transferred to the district/county councils). However, the civil parishes were not a complete third tier of local government. Instead, they were 'community councils' for smaller, rural settlements, which did not have a local government district to themselves. Where urban parish councils had previously existed, they were absorbed into the new urban districts.

Political history of the United Kingdom (1979-present)
A prolonged agricultural depression in Britain at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.
General history and political issues

Following years of political and military agitation for 'Home Rule' for Ireland, the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 established the
Irish Free State
(now the
Republic of Ireland
) as a separate state, leaving
Northern Ireland
as part of the United Kingdom. The country's official name thus became "The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
".
England, as part of the UK, joined the
European Economic Community
in 1973, which became the
European Union
in 1993. The UK left the EU in 2020.
There is a movement in England to create a
devolved English Parliament
. This would give England a local Parliament like those already functioning for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. This issue is referred to as the
West Lothian question
.
Political history and local government
[
edit
]
Further information:
History of local government in England
A
Local Government Commission
was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the
Redcliffe-Maud commission
). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier
unitary authorities
for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of
Merseyside
,
Selnec
(Greater Manchester) and
West Midlands
(
Birmingham
and the
Black Country
), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the
Labour Party
government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the
Conservative Party
won the
June 1970 general election
, and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.
The reforms arising from the
Local Government Act of 1972
resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government which has been used in England. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before, and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts—statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes—were abolished.
The aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country. Onto the blank canvas, new counties were created to cover the entire country; many of these were obviously based on the
historic counties
, but there were some major changes, especially in the north.
This uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. The Local Government Act (1992) established a commission (
Local Government Commission for England
) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the
status quo
should remain.
The
rate-capping rebellion
was a campaign within English local councils in 1985 which aimed to force the Conservative government of
Margaret Thatcher
to withdraw powers to restrict the spending of councils. The campaign's tactic was that councils whose budgets were restricted would refuse to set any budget at all for the financial year 1985-86, requiring the Government to intervene directly in providing local services, or to concede. However, all 15 councils which initially refused to set a rate eventually did so, and the campaign failed to change Government policy. Powers to restrict council budgets have remained in place ever since.
In 1997, the
Lieutenancies Act
was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as
ceremonial counties
, since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the
historic counties
and the counties established in 1974.
While the 1997 Labour government devolved power to
Wales
,
Scotland
and
Northern Ireland
, it refused to create a devolved Assembly or
parliament for England
, planning instead to introduce eight regional assemblies around England to devolve power to the regions. In the event, only a
London Assembly
(and directly elected
Mayor
) was established. Rejection in a referendum of a proposed North-East Assembly in 2004 effectively scrapped those plans. A pre-condition of having a regional assembly was for the whole area to move to unitary authority status. Since the
2005 general election
the government has floated the idea of voluntary mergers of local councils, avoiding a costly reorganisation but achieving desired reform. For instance, the guiding principles of the government's "New Localism" demand levels of efficiency not present in the current over-duplicated two-tier structure.
Recent changes
[
edit
]
In 2009,
new changes to local government
were made whereby a number of new
unitary authorities
were created in areas which previously had a 'two-tier' system of
counties
and
districts
. In five
shire counties
the functions of the county and district councils were combined into a single authority; and in two counties the powers of the county council were absorbed into a significantly reduced number of districts.
The abolition of
regional development agencies
and the creation of
local enterprise partnerships
were announced as part of the
June 2010 United Kingdom budget
.
[84]
On 29 June 2010 a letter was sent from the
Department of Communities and Local Government
and the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
to local authority and business leaders, inviting proposals to replace regional development agencies in their areas by 6 September 2010.
[85]
On 7 September 2010, details were released of 56 proposals for
local enterprise partnerships
that had been received.
[86]
[87]
On 6 October 2010, during the Conservative Party Conference, it was revealed that 22 had been given the provisional 'green light' to proceed and others may later be accepted with amendments.
[88]
Twenty-four bids were announced as successful on 28 October 2010.

The SNCF
BB 75000
(also known as the SNCF
BB 475000
[3]
) are 4 axle,
Bo′Bo′
,
diesel electric locomotives
ordered in 2000 by
SNCF
for freight operations to renew its aging fleet.
[i]
The locomotives are also classified as
Prima DE30BAC
[4]
They are similar in appearance to the
SNCF Class BB 27000
, but are in fact the result of a collaboration between
Alstom
and
Siemens
. The internal electrical components are similar to those found in the Siemens
EuroRunner
made for
ÖBB
; the Rh 2016, and the bodyshell,
bogies
and other equipment being of the
Prima
type made by Alstom.
The initial order was for 400 machines to be delivered from 2007 onwards with an option for a further 100 additional machines. The order is valued at 1 billion euros.
[5]
Development
[
edit
]
Background
[
edit
]
The order for the BB 75000 resulted from a long and arduous project of renewal of diesel freight locomotives, which began in 2000, and spans a period of seven years from the announcement of the tender to the delivery of the new BB 75000s.
SNCF had a requirement for new diesel locomotives for two reasons:
The current diesel fleet is very old
[ii]
and expensive in terms of operation and maintenance.
The changes in European pollution and emission regulations as well as noise regulations make it necessary for the organisation to renew its fleet.
Tenders
[
edit
]
The first document released by SNCF relating to this order was published in November 2000. It refers to delivery of 124 diesel powered freight locomotives and invites manufacturers to submit tenders. With a delivery date between 2003 and 2006 it set out a requirement for two types of locomotives:
55 Single cab locomotives with an average power of 1200 to 1800 kW (with performances comparable to those of
BB 66000
and
BB 67000
) suitable for medium distance routes.
69 High-power devices with two cabs for long-distance trains. These locomotives would be expected to replace
CC 72000
and would need between 2250 and 3200 kW of power.
However the project did not receive sufficient funding for the cost of the expensive high powered Co'Co' locomotives that would fulfil the second role and as a result the project was cancelled.
A few months after the cancellation of the first tender, a second was launched. It is based on the idea of a single multipurpose engine of medium power (1800 kW) similar to designs already available. These units would be used in multiple when necessary to provide a lower cost alternative to the expense of designing a high powered 6 axle from scratch. New tenders were to be delivered by November 2001 and technical meetings with potential manufacturers held during the spring of 2002.
In November 2002, Alstom and Siemens formed a winning consortium (with Alstom taking the lead role) and the project was finalized with SNCF in 2003. The contract was signed on 27 February 2004, and was substantially different from the original specifications published in 2000— not 124 but 400 new machines (all of medium power), which will reduce the average age of the locomotive freight fleet to 15 - 20 years.
The design used already proven components; traction components similar to those in the Siemens built OBB Rh 2016 and the structural design from the Alstom Prima 427000 series of locomotives.
[2]
The purchase contract was signed on 25 March 2004 inside the Station of
Villeneuve-Saint-Georges
, in the presence of the Presidents of the SNCF, Alstom, and Siemens for the purchase of 400 locomotives with a possible further 100.
For the occasion,
BB 437,002
was disguised to resemble an as yet unbuilt BB 475,001.
Testing and approval
[
edit
]
The first locomotives came off the assembly line at Alstom in Belfort in spring 2006. The BB 75001 and 75002 were sent to
Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg-Wildenrath
in Germany in March 2006 for testing by the manufacturer until May 2007. They then returned to Belfort in early June for a final tests before being delivered to the railway in September or October 2007.
BB 75003 and 75004 carried out tests on the national network in June 2006 for the BB 75003. Torque and mechanical tests in took place in
Vitry-sur-Seine
, then journeying to the French Riviera in July 2006 to test dynamic behavior, noise and vibration.
In late October 2006 the exact configurations for the main build of locomotives was issued.
BB 75004 went to
Châlons-en-Champagne
for tests on the brakes, and haulage tests, before travelling to Nevers for tests on the brakes. The process concluded on 21 November 2006 with BB 75006 undertaking shunting tests at
Plouaret
. In February 2007 the order allowing entry into commercial operation was given by the
Établissement public de sécurité ferroviaire
(EPSF) and issued to Fret SNCF on the 27th of March.
Service
[
edit
]
Following the test and approval process the production of the locomotives could begin; by the end of June 2007 thirty locomotives had been built.
All new BB 75000 are received at the
Gare de Longueau
on the
TER Picardie
line in
Amiens
- where they will help replace the
SNCF Class BB 67400
working between northern France and Belgium; from there they will be divided between two depots:
Longueau
: 150 - 200 machines (including those with equipment for cross border operations)
[iii]
Avignon
.
They are primarily used on journeys of less than 400 km with train weight up to 1800 tonnes, above this mass multiple traction is employed.
Their first placements are in the north of France plus the
Île-de-France
from June 11 (
Massy
,
Le Bourget
,
Vaires-sur-Marne
and
Troyes
). Workings in the East and South-East of France will be served by the later production models, while the West will be supported by the new type of
BB 60000
and the
BB 69000
(which are remotorised BB 66000s).
On 28 March 2007, the first commercial multiple working took place consisting of BB 75009 and 75006.
Conclusion
[
edit
]
The introduction of this new locomotive should mean the elimination of
BB 67300
,
CC 72000
, and through multiple unit workings of non-updated
BB 66000
.
It is not impossible that a variant be built or modified for passenger traffic (like the
BB 27300
Transilien, derived from the
SNCF Class BB 27000
) because they have the necessary equipment
[iv]
Updates
[
edit
]
European standards will become increasingly demanding in terms of the requirements for particulate emissions and also the amount of CO
2
emitted. These new guidelines will be implemented in two stages, taking place in January 2009 and in January 2012.
To comply with the first set of standards (January 2009) all new locomotives of this type will be built with a new diesel engine: the MTU 4000 R43. As well as engine modifications, the locomotive's exhaust will be changed (many locomotive manufacturers are implementing new exhaust systems to reduce emitted particulates). This will change the external appearance of these locomotives. All new locomotives built thus will be numbered from 200 onwards, i.e., BB 475200 and upwards in number.

pop
band
Madness
, released on 19 August 1985 as the
lead single
from their sixth studio album
Mad Not Mad
(1985). It was written by
Graham McPherson
and
Chris Foreman
, and produced by
Clive Langer
and
Alan Winstanley
. The song spent 7 weeks on the
UK Singles Chart
, peaking at number 18.
[2]
The song was edited for release as a single, the album version being some thirty seconds longer. A

Critical reception
[
edit
]
Upon its release as a single, Paul Bursche of
Number One
described "Yesterday's Men" as "a grim portrait of a land without hope" and "a real grower that finally emerges into one of the best songs the group have ever done". He added that although it was "very
Sade
-ish", "even the orchestration can't disguise a new lush Madness sound".
[4]
Ian Cranna of
Smash Hits
wrote, This mournful little exhortation to hang on in there with gentle percussion and varied instrumental weaving must be quite satisfying to record after being so nutty for so long, but it's hardly soul-stirring stuff."
[5]
Paolo Hewitt
of
NME
felt the song was "cast in a similar mould" to the band's 1984 song "
One Better Day
" and noted that Madness "have never sounded so wistful and yet so relaxed as this song of optimism and smashed dreams". He praised Suggs' vocals for "fast becoming the vehicle to carry off such sentiments" and noted the song's "lilting and haunting refrain". He concluded it was "assured, classy and irresistible music".
[6]
The song was ranked number 7 among the "
Tracks of the Year
" for 1985 by
NME
.
[7]
In a retrospective review of
Mad Not Mad
, Darryl Cater of
AllMusic
described the song as "dwell[ing] on themes of transience and aging".
[8]
Terry Staunton of
Record Collector
noted, "The wacky humour of old, already on the wane in their previous outing,
Keep Moving
, was almost totally eclipsed by sombre tones of resignation, best exemplified on 'Yesterday's Men'."

Study of the past
This article is about the academic discipline. For a general history of human beings, see
Human history
. For other uses, see
History (disambiguation)
.
Herodotus
(
c.
484
- c.
425
BC) has been considered the "father of history" in the Western world.
History
(derived from
Ancient Greek
ἱστορία
(
historía
)
'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation')
[1]
is the systematic study and documentation of the human
past
.
[2]
[3]
The period of events before the
invention of writing systems
is considered
prehistory
.
[4]
"History" is an
umbrella term
comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events.
Historians
seek knowledge of the past using
historical sources
such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.
[5]
History is incomplete and still has debatable mysteries.
History is an
academic discipline
which uses a
narrative
to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.
[6]
[7]
Historians debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians debate the
nature of history
as an end in itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the present.
[6]
[8]
[9]
[10]
Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding
King Arthur
), are usually classified as
cultural heritage
or
legends
.
[11]
[12]
History differs from
myth
in that it is supported by verifiable
evidence
. However, ancient cultural influences have helped create variant interpretations of the nature of history, which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is taught as a part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a
major discipline
in universities.
Herodotus
, a 5th-century BC
Greek historian
, is often considered the "father of history", as one of the first historians in the Western tradition,
[13]
though he has been criticized as the "father of lies".
[14]
[15]
Along with his contemporary
Thucydides
, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies.
[16]
Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state
chronicle
, the
Spring and Autumn Annals
, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, though only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.
Etymology
History
by
Frederick Dielman
(1896)
The word
history
comes from
historía
(
Ancient Greek
:
ἱστορία
,
romanized
:
historíā
,
lit.
'inquiry, knowledge from inquiry, or judge'
[17]
). It was in that sense that
Aristotle
used the word in his
History of Animals
.
[18]
The ancestor word
ἵστωρ
is attested early on in
Homeric Hymns
,
Heraclitus
, the
Athenian
ephebes
' oath, and in
Boeotic
inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar). The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as
historia
, meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative".
History
was borrowed from Latin (possibly via
Old Irish
or
Old Welsh
) into
Old English
as
stær
("history, narrative, story"), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.
[19]
Meanwhile, as Latin became
Old French
(and
Anglo-Norman
),
historia
developed into forms such as
istorie
,
estoire
, and
historie
, with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (
c.
1240
), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (
c.
1265
), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (
c.
1462
)".
[19]
It was from Anglo-Norman that
history
was brought into
Middle English
, and it has persisted. It appears in the 13th-century
Ancrene Wisse
, but seems to have become a common word in the late 14th century, with an early attestation appearing in
John Gower
's
Confessio Amantis
of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In Middle English, the meaning of
history
was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-15th century.
[19]
With the
Renaissance
, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that
Francis Bacon
used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about
natural history
. For him,
historia
was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by
memory
(while
science
was provided by
reason
, and
poetry
was provided by
fantasy
).
[20]
In an expression of the linguistic
synthetic
vs.
analytic/isolating
dichotomy, English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and
storytelling
in general. In modern
German
,
French
, and most Germanic and
Romance languages
, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".
Historian
in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all
European languages
, the substantive
history
is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, or the word
historiography
.
[18]
[

The adjective
historical
is attested from 1661, and
historic
from 1669.
[21]
Description
The title page to
The Historians' History of the World
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of
Benedetto Croce
, "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.
[22]
The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.
All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.
[23]
The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past"). Part of the historian's role is to skillfully and objectively use the many sources from the past, most often found in the archives. The process of creating a narrative inevitably generates debate, as historians remember or emphasize different events of the past.
[24]
The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the
humanities
, other times part of the
social sciences
.
[25]
It can be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some historians strongly support one or the other classification.
[26]
In the 20th century the
Annales school
revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as
economics
,
sociology
, and
geography
in the study of global history.
[27]
Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an
oral tradition
, and attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.
[28]
But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.
Archaeology
is especially helpful in unearthing buried sites and objects, which contribute to the study of history. Archeological finds rarely stand alone, with narrative sources complementing its discoveries. Archeology's methodologies and approaches are independent from the field of history. "Historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archeology which often contrasts its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical
Annapolis, Maryland
, US, has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents idealizing "liberty" and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth made apparent by the study of the total historical environment.
There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically,
culturally
, territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant intersections are present. It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, though the trend has been toward specialization. The area called
Big History
resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or
theoretical
aim, but may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.
[29]
Prehistory
Further information:
Protohistory
Human history
is the memory of the past
experience
of
Homo sapiens sapiens
around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of
Sub-Saharan Africa
and
pre-Columbian
America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the
Western world
.
[30]
In 1961, British historian
E. H. Carr
wrote:
The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.
[31]
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as
Indigenous Australians
and New Zealand
Māori
in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.
Historiography
Main article:
Historiography
The title page to
La Historia d'Italia
Historiography has a number of related meanings.
[32]
Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of
methodology
and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative toward long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s").
[32]
Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the
philosophy of history
. As a
meta-level
analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations,
world view
, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Historians debate whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.
[33]
[34]
Methods

A depiction of the ancient
Library of Alexandria
Historical method basics
The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
When was
the source, written or unwritten, produced (
date
)?
Where was it produced (
localization
)?
By whom was it produced (
authorship
)?
From what pre-existing material was it produced (
analysis
)?
In what original form was it produced (
integrity
)?
What is the evidential value of its contents (
credibility
)?
The first four are known as
historical criticism
; the fifth,
textual criticism
; and, together, external criticism. The sixth and final inquiry about a source is called internal criticism.
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use
primary sources
, and other evidence, to research and write history.
Herodotus
, from the 5th-century BC,
[35]
has been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary
Thucydides
is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in the
History of the Peloponnesian War
. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as the product of the choices and actions of humans, and looked at
cause and effect
, rather than the result of divine intervention (though Herodotus was not wholly committed to this idea himself).
[35]
In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a nominally neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of human actions. Greek historians viewed history as
cyclical
, with events regularly recurring.
[36]
There was sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval
China
. The groundwork for professional historiography in
East Asia
was established by court historian
Sima Qian
(145-90 BC), author of the
Records of the Grand Historian
(
Shiji
) and posthumously known as the Father of
Chinese historiography
.
Saint Augustine
was influential in
Christian
and
Western thought
at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and
Renaissance
periods, history was often studied through a
sacred
or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
brought
philosophy
and a more
secular
approach in historical study.
[29]
In the preface to his book, the
Muqaddimah
(1377), the
Arab historian
and
early sociologist
,
Ibn Khaldun
, warned of 7 mistakes he thought historians committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun criticized "idle
superstition
and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a
scientific method
to the study of history, and referred to it as his "new science".
[37]
His method laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of
state
,
communication
,
propaganda
and
systematic bias
in history,
[38]
and so is considered to be the "father of historiography"
[39]
[40]
or the "father of the philosophy of history".
[41]
In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. In 1851,
Herbert Spencer
summarized these methods:"From the successive strata of our historical deposits, they [historians] diligently gather all the highly colored fragments, pounce upon everything that is curious and sparkling and chuckle like children over their glittering acquisitions; meanwhile the rich veins of wisdom that ramify amidst this worthless debris, lie utterly neglected. Cumbrous volumes of rubbish are greedily accumulated, while those masses of rich ore, that should have been dug out, and from which golden truths might have been smelted, are left untaught and unsought."
[42]
By the "rich ore" Spencer meant scientific theory of history. Meanwhile,
Henry Thomas Buckle
expressed a dream of history becoming one day a science: "In regard to nature, events apparently the most irregular and capricious have been explained and have been shown to be in accordance with certain fixed and universal laws. This has been done because men of ability and, above all, men of patient, untiring thought have studied events with the view of discovering their regularity, and if human events were subject to a similar treatment, we have every right to expect similar results.
[43]
Contrary to Buckle's dream, the 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods became
Leopold von Ranke
in Germany. He limited history to "what really happened" and by this directed the field further away from science. For Ranke, historical data should be collected carefully, examined objectively and put together with critical rigor. But these procedures "are merely the prerequisites and preliminaries of science. The heart of science is searching out order and regularity in the data being examined and in formulating generalizations or laws about them."
[44]
As Historians like Ranke and many who followed him have pursued it,
no
, history is not a science. Thus if Historians tell us that, given the manner in which he practices his craft, it cannot be considered a science, we must take him at his word. If he is not doing science, then, whatever else he is doing, he is not
doing
science. The traditional Historian is thus no scientist and history, as conventionally practiced, is not a science.
[45]
In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or
great men
, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was to treat history more as a
social science
rather than
art
, which traditionally had been the case. Leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included
Fernand Braudel
and
E. H. Carr
. Many are noted for their multidisciplinary approach e.g. Braudel combined history with geography. Nevertheless, these multidisciplinary approaches failed to produce a theory of history. So far only one theory of history came from a professional historian.
[46]
Whatever other theories of history exist, they were written by experts from other fields (for example, Marxian theory of history). The field of
digital history
has begun to address ways of using computer technology, to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.
In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as
Hugh Trevor-Roper
argued the key to historians' work was the power of the
imagination
, and hence contended that history should be understood as art.
French historians
associated with the
Annales school
introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of
cultural history
(cf.
histoire des mentalités
). Intellectual historians such as
Herbert Butterfield
have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups. A genre of
social history
to emerge post-WWII was
Alltagsgeschichte
(History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as
Ian Kershaw
examined what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in
Nazi Germany
.
Marxist historians
sought to validate
Karl Marx
's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as
François Furet
have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history.
Feminist
historians argued for the importance of studying the experience of women.
Postmodernists
have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources.
Keith Windschuttle
's 1994 book,
The Killing of History
defended the worth of history.
Today, most historians begin their research in the archives, on either a physical or digital platform. They often propose an argument and use research to support it.
John H. Arnold
proposed that history is an argument, which creates the possibility of creating change.
[5]
Digital information companies, such as
Google
, have sparked controversy over the role of internet censorship in information access.
[47]
Marxian theory
Main article:
Historical materialism
The
Marxist theory
of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the
material conditions
at any given time - in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.
[48]
Overall,
Marx
and
Engels
claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in
Western Europe
.
[49]
Marxist historiography
was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the communism's collapse there, its influence has significantly reduced.
[50]
Potential shortcomings in the production of history
Many historians believe that the production of history is embedded with
bias
because events and known facts in history can be interpreted in a variety of ways.
Constantin Fasolt
suggested that history is linked to politics by the practice of silence itself.
[51]
He said: "A second common view of the link between history and politics rests on the elementary observation that historians are often influenced by politics."
[51]
According to
Michel-Rolph Trouillot
, the historical process is rooted in the archives, therefore silences, or parts of history that are forgotten, may be an intentional part of a narrative strategy that dictates how areas of history are remembered.
[24]
Historical omissions can occur in many ways and can have a profound effect on historical records. Information can also purposely be excluded or left out accidentally. Historians have coined multiple terms that describe the act of omitting historical information, including: "silencing",
[24]
"selective memory",
[52]
and erasures.
[53]
Gerda Lerner
, a twentieth century historian who focused much of her work on historical omissions involving women and their accomplishments, explained the negative impact that these omissions had on minority groups.
[52]
Environmental historian
William Cronon
proposed three ways to combat bias and ensure authentic and accurate narratives: narratives must not contradict known fact, they must make ecological sense (specifically for environmental history), and published work must be reviewed by scholarly community and other historians to ensure accountability.
[53]

Periods
Main article:
Periodization
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these
periods of time
names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.
[54]
The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period.
Centuries
and
decades
are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the
dating system
used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.
[55]
Prehistoric periodization
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to archeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. In
archeology
, the usual method for periodization of the distant
prehistoric
past is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the
Stone Age
,
Bronze Age
, and
Iron Age
, with subdivisions that are also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.
[56]
This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodizations, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology, and that are thus devoid of any specific meaning.
Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through
radiocarbon dating
and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighboring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodization, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework, with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodization boundaries" and that different trajectories of change need to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.
[57]
Geographical locations
Particular
geographical
locations can form the basis of historical study, for example,
continents
,
countries
, and
cities
. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to the methods and theory from the discipline of
geography
.
[58]
According to
Jules Michelet
in his book
Histoire de France
(1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air".
[59]
Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the
geography of Egypt
is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of
climate
, which historians like
Ellsworth Huntington
and
Ellen Churchill Semple
cited as a crucial influence on the course of history. Huntington and Semple further argued that climate has an impact on racial temperament.
[60]
Regions

History of the Pacific Islands
covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Political
Main articles:
Political history
and
Political history in the United States
Political history covers the type of government, the branches of government, leaders, legislation, political activism, political parties, and voting.
Military
Main article:
Military history
Military history
concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat.
[62]
The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.
[63]
Religious
Main article:
History of religion
The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include
Church History
,
The Catholic Historical Review
, and
History of Religions
. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.
[64]
This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.
[65]
Social
Main article:
Social history
Social history
, sometimes called the
new social history
, is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.
[66]
In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.
[67]
In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified themselves with social history while
political history
came next with 1425 (25%).
[68]
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with
political history
,
intellectual history
and the history of
great men
. English historian
G. M. Trevelyan
saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."
[69]
While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in".
[70]
Subfields
The chief subfields of social history include:
Black history
Demographic history
Ethnic history
Gender history
History of childhood
History of education
History of the family
Labor history
LGBT history
Rural history
Urban history
American urban history
Women's history
Cultural
Main article:
Cultural history
Cultural history replaced
social history
as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic. Cultural history includes the study of
art in society
as well is the study of images and human visual production (
iconography
).
[71]
Diplomatic
Main article:
Diplomatic history
Diplomatic history
focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars.
[72]
More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of
political history
is the study of the conduct of
international relations
between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian
Muriel Chamberlain
notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies".
[73]
She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.
Economic
Main articles:
Economic history
and
Business history
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.
[74]
Business history
deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history. Business history is most often taught in business schools.
[75]
Environmental
Main article:
Environmental history
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.
[76]
It is an offshoot of the environmental movement, which was kickstarted by Rachel Carson's
Silent Spring
in the 1960s.
World
Main article:
World history (field)
See also:
Human history
and
Universal history
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,
[77]
Japan
[78]
and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.
It has led to highly controversial interpretations by
Oswald Spengler
and
Arnold J. Toynbee
, among others.
The World History Association publishes the
Journal of World History
every quarter since 1990.
[79]
The H-World discussion list
[80]
serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.
People's
Main article:
People's history
A
people's history
is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the
perspective of common people
. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other types of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the
disenfranchised
, the
oppressed
, the
poor
, the
nonconformists
, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the
History Workshop
movement in Britain in the 1960s.
[81]
Intellectual
Main article:
Intellectual history
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.
[82]
[83]
Gender
Main articles:
Gender history
and
LGBT history
Gender history
is a subfield of History and
Gender studies
, which looks at the past from the perspective of
gender
. The outgrowth of gender history from
women's history
stemmed from many non-
feminist
historians dismissing the importance of women in history. According to Joan W. Scott, "Gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differences between the sexes, and gender is a primary way of signifying relations of power",
[84]
meaning that gender historians study the social effects of perceived differences between the sexes and how all genders use allotted power in societal and political structures. Despite being a relatively new field, gender history has had a significant effect on the general study of history. Gender history traditionally differs from women's history in its inclusion of all aspects of gender such as masculinity and femininity, and today's gender history extends to include people who identify outside of that binary.
LGBT history
deals with the first recorded instances of same-sex love and sexuality of
ancient civilizations
, and involves the history of
lesbian
,
gay
,
bisexual
and
transgender
(
LGBT
) peoples and cultures around the world.
[85]
Public
Main article:
Public history
Public history
describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the United States and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and
historic sites
, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.
[86]
Historians
For a more comprehensive list, see
List of historians
.
Benedetto Croce
Ban Zhao
, courtesy name Huiban, was the first known female Chinese historian.
Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. They discover this information through archeological evidence, written primary sources, verbal stories or oral histories, and other archival material. In
lists of historians
, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized.
Chroniclers
and
annalists
, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.
Judgement
See also:
Ash heap of history
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history".
[87]
The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of
legal judgements
, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.
[88]
A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of
collective memory
.
Pseudohistory
Main article:
Pseudohistory
Pseudohistory
is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard
historiographical conventions
in a way which undermines their conclusions. It is closely related to deceptive
historical revisionism
. Works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.
Teaching
Scholarship vs teaching
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor
Charles Harding Firth
, Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defense of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where
Thomas Frederick Tout
was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.
[89]
[90]
In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.
[91]
Nationalism
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching
world history
or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.
[92]
At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.
The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the
Nouvelle histoire
as disseminated after the 1960s by
Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement
and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery". Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.
[93]
Bias in school teaching
History books in a bookstore
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official narrative about national enemies.
[94]
In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the
Nanking Massacre
has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.
[95]
Another example includes Turkey, where there is no mention of the
Armenian Genocide
in Turkish textbooks as a result of the denial of the genocide.
[96]
It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.
[97]
[98]
In the
United States
, textbooks published by the same company often differ in content from state to state.
[99]
An example of content that is represented different in different regions of the country is the history of the
Southern states
, where
slavery
and the
American Civil War
are treated as controversial topics.
McGraw-Hill Education
for example, was criticized for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.
[100]
Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.
[101]
[102]
In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace." The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."

Apollo, God of Light, Eloquence, Poetry and the Fine Arts with Urania, Muse of Astronomy
(1798) by
Charles Meynier
Apollo
[a]
or
Apollon
[3]
is one of the
Olympian deities
in
classical Greek
and
Roman religion
and
Greek
and
Roman mythology
. Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the
Sun
and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of
Zeus
and
Leto
, and the twin brother of
Artemis
, goddess of the hunt. He is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the
kouros
(ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth). Apollo is known in Greek-influenced
Etruscan mythology
as
Apulu
.
[4]
As the patron deity of
Delphi
(
Apollo Pythios
), Apollo is an
oracular
god—the prophetic
deity
of the
Delphic Oracle
and also the deity of ritual purification. His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters. He was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil, and is referred to as
Alexicacus
, the "averter of evil".
Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son
Asclepius
. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly
plague
with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows.
As the god of
mousike
,
[b]
Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common
attribute of Apollo
. Protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a
kourotrophos
, Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children, and he presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (
ephebeia
) and dedicated to Apollo. The god himself is depicted with long, uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth.
Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary rustic duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions, is associated with dominion over
colonists
, and was the giver of laws. His oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city. Apollo
Agyieus
was the protector of the streets, public places and home entrances.
In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as
Apollo Helios
he became identified among Greeks with
Helios
, the personification of the Sun.
[5]
In Latin texts, however, there was no
conflation
of Apollo with
Sol
among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.
[6]
Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

Apollo (
Attic
,
Ionic
, and
Homeric Greek
:
Ἀπόλλων
,
Apollōn
(
GEN
Ἀπόλλωνος
);
Doric
:
Ἀπέλλων
,
Apellōn
;
Arcadocypriot
:
Ἀπείλων
,
Apeilōn
;
Aeolic
:
Ἄπλουν
,
Aploun
;
Latin
:
Apollō
)
The name
Apollo
—unlike the related
older name
Paean
—is generally not found in the
Linear B
(
Mycenean Greek
) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the
lacunose
form
]pe-rjo-[
(Linear B: ]
𐀟𐁊
-[) on the
KN
E 842 tablet,
[7]
[8]
[9]
though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read "
Hyperion
" ([u]-pe-rjo-[ne]).
[10]
The
etymology
of the name is uncertain. The spelling
Ἀπόλλων
(
pronounced
[a.pól.lɔːn]
in
Classical Attic
) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the
common era
, but the
Doric
form,
Apellon
(
Ἀπέλλων
), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier
*
Ἀπέλjων
. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month
Apellaios
(
Ἀπελλαῖος
),
[11]
and the offerings
apellaia
(
ἀπελλαῖα
) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival
apellai
(
ἀπέλλαι
).
[12]
[13]
According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word
apella
(
ἀπέλλα
), which originally meant "wall," "fence for animals" and later "assembly within the limits of the square."
[14]
[15]
Apella
(
Ἀπέλλα
) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,
[14]
corresponding to the
ecclesia
(
ἐκκλησία
).
R. S. P. Beekes
rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun
apellai
and suggested a
Pre-Greek
proto-form *
Apal
y
un
.
[16]
Several instances of
popular etymology
are attested by ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb
ἀπόλλυμι
(
apollymi
), "to destroy".
[17]
Plato
in
Cratylus
connects the name with
ἀπόλυσις
(
apolysis
), "redemption", with
ἀπόλουσις
(
apolousis
), "purification", and with
ἁπλοῦν
(
[h]aploun
), "simple",
[18]
in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name,
Ἄπλουν
, and finally with
Ἀειβάλλων
(
aeiballon
), "ever-shooting".
Hesychius
connects the name Apollo with the Doric
ἀπέλλα
(
apella
), which means "assembly", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation
σηκός
(
sekos
), "fold", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.
[19]
In the
ancient Macedonian language
πέλλα
(
pella
) means "stone,"
[20]
and some
toponyms
may be derived from this word:
Πέλλα
(
Pella
,
[21]
the capital of
ancient Macedonia
) and
Πελλήνη
(
Pellēnē
/
Pellene
).
[22]
The
Hittite
form
Apaliunas
(
d
x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš
) is attested in the
Manapa-Tarhunta letter
.
[23]
The
Hittite
testimony reflects an early form
*
Apeljōn
, which may also be surmised from the comparison of Cypriot
Ἀπείλων
with Doric
Ἀπέλλων
.
[24]
The name of the Lydian god
Qλdãns
/kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y
>
d.
[25]
Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric
Ἀπέλjων
and Hittite
Apaliunas
.
A
Luwian
etymology suggested for
Apaliunas
makes Apollo "The One of Entrapment", perhaps in the sense of "Hunter".
[26]
Greco-Roman epithets
Apollo's chief
epithet
was
Phoebus
(

FEE
-bəs
;
Φοῖβος
,
Phoibos
Greek pronunciation:
[pʰó͜i.bos]
), literally "bright".
[27]
It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in
Latin literature
.

Celtic epithets and cult titles
Apollo was worshipped throughout the
Roman Empire
. In the traditionally
Celtic
lands, he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with
Celtic gods
of similar character.
[48]
Apollo Atepomarus
("the great horseman" or "possessing a great horse"). Apollo was worshipped at
Mauvières
(
Indre
). Horses were, in the Celtic world, closely linked to the Sun.
[49]
Apollo Belenus
("bright" or "brilliant"). This epithet was given to Apollo in parts of
Gaul
, Northern Italy and
Noricum
(part of modern Austria). Apollo Belenus was a healing and sun god.
[50]
Apollo Cunomaglus
("hound lord"). A title given to Apollo at a shrine at
Nettleton Shrub
,
Wiltshire
. May have been a god of healing. Cunomaglus himself may originally have been an independent healing god.
[51]
Apollo Grannus
. Grannus was a healing spring god, later equated with Apollo.
[52]
[53]
[54]
Apollo Maponus
. A god known from inscriptions in Britain. This may be a local fusion of Apollo and
Maponus
.
Apollo Moritasgus
("masses of sea water"). An epithet for Apollo at Alesia, where he was worshipped as the god of healing and, possibly, of physicians.
[55]
Apollo Vindonnus
("clear light"). Apollo Vindonnus had a temple at
Essarois
, near
Châtillon-sur-Seine
in present-day
Burgundy
. He was a god of healing, especially of the eyes.
[53]
Apollo Virotutis
("benefactor of mankind"). Apollo Virotutis was worshipped, among other places, at Fins d'Annecy (
Haute-Savoie
) and at
Jublains
(
Maine-et-Loire
).
[54]
[56]
Origins
The
Omphalos
in the Museum of
Delphi
Apollo is considered the most Hellenic (Greek) of the
Olympian gods
.
[57]
[58]
[59]
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece,
Delphi
and
Delos
, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to
Artemis
, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent
Python
. For the Greeks, Apollo was the most Greek of all the gods, and through the centuries he acquired different functions. In
Archaic Greece
he was the
prophet
, the oracular god who in older times was connected with "healing". In
Classical Greece
he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.
[60]
Walter Burkert
discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed "a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component."
[61]
Healer and god-protector from evil
Apollo Victorious over the Python
by
Pietro Francavilla
(1591) depicting Apollo's victory over the serpent Python
[62]
(
The Walters Art Museum
).
In classical times, his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and he was therefore called "apotropaios" (
ἀποτρόπαιος
, "averting evil") and "alexikakos" (
ἀλεξίκακος
"keeping off ill"; from
v.
ἀλέξω
+
n.
κακόν
).
[63]
Apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer. Some commonly-used examples are "paion" (
παιών
literally "healer" or "helper")
[64]
"epikourios" (
ἐπικούριος
, "succouring"), "oulios" (
οὔλιος
, "healer, baleful")
[65]
and "loimios" (
λοίμιος
, "of the plague"). In later writers, the word, "paion", usually spelled "Paean", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of
healing
.
[66]
Apollo in his aspect of "healer" has a connection to the primitive god
Paean
(
Παιών-Παιήων
), who did not have a cult of his own. Paean serves as the healer of the gods in the
Iliad
, and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion.
[67]
It is suggested, though unconfirmed, that he is connected to the
Mycenaean
figure
pa-ja-wo-ne
(Linear B:
𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚
).
[68]
[69]
[70]
Paean was the personification of holy songs sung by "seer-doctors" (
ἰατρομάντεις
), which were supposed to cure disease.
[71]
Homer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of
apotropaic
thanksgiving or triumph.
[72]
Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods: to
Dionysus
, to Apollo
Helios
, to Apollo's son
Asclepius
the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the
Python
led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the
Roman
custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.
In the
Iliad
, Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the
Vedic
god of disease
Rudra
.
[73]
He sends a plague (
λοιμός
) to the
Achaeans
. Knowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent, they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows, called a
hecatomb
.
[74]
Dorian origin
The
Homeric Hymn to Apollo
depicts Apollo as an intruder from the north.
[75]
The connection with the northern-dwelling
Dorians
and their initiation festival
apellai
is reinforced by the month
Apellaios
in northwest Greek calendars.
[76]
The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (
Doric
:
Ἀπέλλων
).
[77]
Apellaios
is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the "megistos kouros" (the great Kouros).
[78]
However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the
Ancient Macedonian
word "pella" (
Pella
),
stone
. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (
Omphalos
).
[79]
[80]
Minoan origin
Ornamented golden
Minoan
labrys
George Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity Paiawon, worshipped in Crete, to have originated at Delphi.
[81]
In the
Homeric Hymn
, Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices.
Apollo Delphinios
or
Delphidios
was a sea-god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands.
[82]
Apollo's sister
Artemis
, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with
Britomartis
(Diktynna), the Minoan "Mistress of the animals". In her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the "Master of the animals", a bow-wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo.
[83]
Anatolian origin
Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from
Ambracia
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.
[11]
The name of Apollo's mother
Leto
has
Lydian
origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of
Asia Minor
. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from
Anatolia
, which is the origin of
Sibyl
, and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old
Assyro
-
Babylonian
texts. These rituals were spread into the empire of the
Hittites
, and from there into Greece.
[84]
Homer
pictures Apollo on the side of the
Trojans
, fighting against the
Achaeans
, during the
Trojan War
. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to
Appaliunas
, a tutelary god of
Wilusa
(
Troy
) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.
[85]
The stones found in front of the gates of
Homeric
Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of
Artimus
(
Artemis
) and
Qλdãns
, whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving
Lydian
texts
.
[86]
However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of
Qλdãns
with Apollo.
[87]
The Greeks gave to him the name
ἀγυιεύς
agyieus
as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.
[88]
However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the
full moon
, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (
sibutu
) indicates a
Babylonian
origin.
[89]
The
Late Bronze Age
(from 1700 to 1200 BCE)
Hittite
and
Hurrian
Aplu
was a god of
plague
, invoked during plague years. Here we have an
apotropaic
situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning
the son of
, was a title given to the god
Nergal
, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun
Shamash
.
[90]
[

Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god (
δεινὸς θεός
) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.
[91]
In
Iliad
, his priest prays to
Apollo Smintheus
,
[92]
the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.
[35]
[93]
[94]
All these functions, including the function of the healer-god
Paean
, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.
Proto-Indo-European
The
Vedic
Rudra
has some similar functions to Apollo. The terrible god is called "the archer" and the bow is also an attribute of
Shiva
.
[95]
Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god.
[96]
However the
Indo-European
component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.
Oracular cult
Columns of the
Temple of Apollo
at Delphi, Greece
Oracular tripod.
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence:
Delos
and
Delphi
. In cult practice,
Delian Apollo
and
Pythian Apollo
(the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.
[59]
Lycia
was sacred to the god, for this Apollo was also called Lycian.
[97]
[98]
Apollo's
cult
was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the
archaic period
, and the frequency of
theophoric names
such as
Apollodorus
or
Apollonios
and cities named
Apollonia
testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at
Didyma
and
Claros
pronounced the so-called "theological oracles", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an
all-encompassing, highest deity
. "In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent.
Julian the Apostate
(359-361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed."
[11]
Oracular shrines
Delos lions
Apollo had a famous
oracle
in Delphi, and other notable ones in
Claros
and
Didyma
. His oracular shrine in
Abae
in
Phocis
, where he bore the
toponymic
epithet
Abaeus
(
Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος
,
Apollon Abaios
), was important enough to be consulted by
Croesus
.
[99]
His oracular shrines include:
Abae
in
Phocis
.
Bassae
in the
Peloponnese
.
At
Clarus
, on the west coast of
Asia Minor
; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a
pneuma
, from which the priests drank.
In
Corinth
, the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of
Tenea
, from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
At
Khyrse
, in
Troad
, the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
In
Delos
, there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
In
Delphi
, the
Pythia
became filled with the
pneuma
of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the
Adyton
.
In
Didyma
, an oracle on the coast of
Anatolia
, south west of
Lydian
(
Luwian
)
Sardis
, in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by
Branchus
, son or lover of Apollo.
In
Hierapolis Bambyce
, Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise
De Dea Syria
, the sanctuary of the
Syrian Goddess
contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.
[100]
At
Patara
, in
Lycia
, there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
In
Segesta
in Sicily.
Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
In
Oropus
, north of
Athens
, the oracle
Amphiaraus
, was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
in Labadea, 20 miles (32 km) east of Delphi,
Trophonius
, another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.
Temples of Apollo
Main articles:

and
Roman temple
Partial view of the temple of Apollo Epikurios (healer) at
Bassae
in southern Greece
Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in
Crete
, do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered
divine
, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of
Doric order
. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be
canonic
, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.
[101]
From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of
Pythagoras
, who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.
[102]
The
Doric order
dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the
Ionic order
, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the
Corinthian order
gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.
The most important temples are:
Greek temples
Temple of the Delians at
Delos
, dedicated to Apollo (478 BC). 19th-century pen-and-wash restoration.
Temple of Apollo Smintheus in
Çanakkale Province
, Turkey
Thebes, Greece
: The oldest temple probably dedicated to
Apollo Ismenius
was built in the 9th century BC. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The
Doric
temple was built in the early 7th century BC., but only some small parts have been found
[103]
A festival called
Daphnephoria
was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called "daphnephoros".
[104]
Eretria
: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived on the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of
Apollo Daphnephoros
, "Apollo, laurel-bearer", or "carrying off Daphne", is dated to 800 BC. The temple was curvilinear
hecatombedon
(a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century BC, with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 BC, with the
stylobate
measuring 21,00 x 43,00 m. The number of
pteron
column was 6 x 14.
[105]
[106]
Dreros
(
Crete
). The temple of
Apollo Delphinios
dates from the 7th century BC, or probably from the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of
Delphi
.
[107]
The dimensions of the plan are 10,70 x 24,00 m and the building was not peripteral. It contains column-bases of the
Minoan
type, which may be considered as the predecessors of the
Doric
columns.
[108]
Gortyn
(
Crete
). A temple of
Pythian Apollo
, was built in the 7th century BC. The plan measured 19,00 x 16,70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was a single door on the east side.
Thermon
(
West Greece
): The
Doric
temple of
Apollo Thermios
, was built in the middle of the 7th century BC. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century, on which a
peristyle
was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.
[109]

Corinth
: A
Doric
temple was built in the 6th century BC. The temple's
stylobate
measures 21.36 x 53.30 m, and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 15. There was a double row of inner columns. The style is similar to the Temple of Alcmeonidae at
Delphi
.
[110]
The Corinthians were considered to be the inventors of the
Doric order
.
[109]
Napes (
Lesbos
): An
Aeolic
temple probably of
Apollo Napaios
was built in the 7th century BC. Some special capitals with floral ornament have been found, which are called
Aeolic
, and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.
[111]
Cyrene, Libya
: The oldest
Doric
temple of Apollo was built in
c.
600 BC
. The number of pteron columns was 6 x 11, and it measures 16.75 x 30.05 m at the stylobate. There was a double row of sixteen inner columns on stylobates. The capitals were made from stone.
[111]
Naukratis
: An
Ionic
temple was built in the early 6th century BC. Only some fragments have been found and the earlier ones, made from limestone, are identified among the oldest of the
Ionic order
.
[112]
Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Syracuse
Syracuse, Sicily
: A
Doric
temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The temple's
stylobate
measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.
[113]
Selinus
(
Sicily
):The
Doric
Temple C
dates from 550 BC, and it was probably dedicated to Apollo. The temple's stylobate measures 10.48 x 41.63 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. There was a portico with a second row of columns, which is also attested for the temple at
Syracuse
.
[114]
Delphi
: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century BC. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The "Temple of Alcmeonidae" was built in
c.
513 BC
and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.
[115]
A fest similar with Apollo's fest at
Thebes, Greece
was celebrated every nine years. A boy was sent to the temple, who walked on the sacred road and returned carrying a laurel branch (
dopnephoros
). The maidens participated with joyful songs.
[104]
Chios
: An
Ionic
temple of
Apollo Phanaios
was built at the end of the 6th century BC. Only some small parts have been found and the capitals had floral ornament.
[111]
Abae
(
Phocis
). The temple was destroyed by the
Persians
in the invasion of
Xerxes
in 480 BC, and later by the
Boeotians
. It was rebuilt by
Hadrian
.
[116]
The oracle was in use from early
Mycenaean
times to the Roman period, and shows the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion.
[117]
Floor plan of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae
Bassae
(
Peloponnesus
): A temple dedicated to
Apollo Epikourios
("Apollo the helper"), was built in 430 BC, designed by
Iktinos
. It combined
Doric
and
Ionic
elements, and the earliest use of a column with a
Corinthian
capital in the middle.
[118]
The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the
stylobate
measuring 14.5 x 38.3 metres
[119]
containing a
Doric
peristyle
of 6 x 15 columns. The roof left a central space open to admit light and air.
Delos
: A temple probably dedicated to Apollo and not peripteral, was built in the late 7th century BC, with a plan measuring 10,00 x 15,60 m. The
Doric
Great temple of Apollo, was built in
c.
475 BC
. The temple's stylobate measures 13.72 x 29.78 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 13. Marble was extensively used.
[111]
Ambracia
: A
Doric
peripteral temple dedicated to
Apollo Pythios Sotir
was built in 500 BC, at the centre of the Greek city
Arta
. Only some parts have been found, and it seems that the temple was built on earlier sanctuaries dedicated to Apollo. The temple measures 20,75 x 44,00 m at the
stylobate
. The foundation which supported the statue of the god, still exists.
[120]
Temple of Apollo, Didyma
Didyma
(near
Miletus
): The gigantic
Ionic
temple of
Apollo Didymaios
started around 540 BC. The construction ceased and then it was restarted in 330 BC. The temple is dipteral, with an outer row of 10 x 21 columns, and it measures 28.90 x 80.75 m at the stylobate.
[121]
Clarus
(near ancient
Colophon
): According to the legend, the famous seer Calchas, on his return from Troy, came to Clarus. He challenged the seer Mopsus, and died when he lost.
[122]
The
Doric
temple of
Apollo Clarius
was probably built in the 3rd century BC., and it was peripteral with 6 x 11 columns. It was reconstructed at the end of the Hellenistic period, and later from the emperor
Hadrian
but Pausanias claims that it was still incomplete in the 2nd century BC.
[123]
Hamaxitus
(
Troad
): In the
Iliad
,
Chryses
the priest of Apollo, addresses the god with the epithet Smintheus (Lord of Mice), related to the god's ancient role as bringer of the disease (plague). Recent excavations indicate that the Hellenistic temple of
Apollo Smintheus
was constructed in 150-125 BC, but the symbol of the mouse god was used on coinage probably from the 4th century .
[124]
The temple measures 40,00 x 23,00 m at the
stylobate
, and the number of pteron columns was 8 x 14.
[125]
Pythion (
Ancient Greek
:
Πύθιον
), this was the name of a shrine of Apollo at
Athens
near the
Ilisos
river. It was created by Peisistratos, and tripods were placed there by those who had won in the cyclic chorus at the
Thargelia
.
[126]
Setae (Lydia)
: The temple of
Apollo Aksyros
located in the city.
[127]
Apollonia Pontica
: There were two temples of Apollo Healer in the city. One from the Late Archaic period and the other from the Early Classical period.
[128]
Ikaros island in the Persian Gulf
(modern
Failaka Island
): There was a temple of Apollo on the island.
[129]
Argos in
Cyprus
: there was a temple of Apollo Erithios (Ἐριθίου Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερῷ).

[38]
Etruscan and Roman temples
Veii
(
Etruria
): The temple of Apollo was built in the late 6th century BC, indicating the spread of Apollo's culture (Aplu) in Etruria. There was a prostyle porch, which is called
Tuscan
, and a triple cella 18,50 m wide.
[131]
Falerii Veteres
(
Etruria
): A temple of Apollo was built probably in the 4th-3rd century BC. Parts of a terracotta capital, and a terracotta base have been found. It seems that the Etruscan columns were derived from the archaic Doric.
[131]
A cult of
Apollo Soranus
is attested by one inscription found near Falerii.
[132]
Plan of the
Temple of Apollo (Pompeii)
Pompeii
(Italy): The cult of Apollo was widespread in the region of Campania since the 6th century BC. The temple was built in 120 BC, but its beginnings lie in the 6th century BC. It was reconstructed after an earthquake in AD 63. It demonstrates a mixing of styles which formed the basis of Roman architecture. The columns in front of the cella formed a
Tuscan
prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back. The peripteral colonnade of 48
Ionic
columns was placed in such a way that the emphasis was given to the front side.
[133]
Rome: The
temple of Apollo Sosianus
and the
temple of Apollo Medicus
. The first temple building dates to 431 BC, and was dedicated to Apollo Medicus (the doctor), after a plague of 433 BC.
[134]
It was rebuilt by
Gaius Sosius
, probably in 34 BC. Only three columns with
Corinthian
capitals exist today. It seems that the cult of Apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid-5th century BC.
[135]
Rome: The
temple of Apollo Palatinus
was located on the Palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city. It was dedicated by
Augustus
in 28 BC. The façade of the original temple was
Ionic
and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble. Many famous statues by Greek masters were on display in and around the temple, including a marble statue of the god at the entrance and a statue of Apollo in the cella.
[136]
Melite
(modern
Mdina
,
Malta
): A
Temple of Apollo
was built in the city in the 2nd century AD. Its remains were discovered in the 18th century, and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures. Parts of the temple's podium were rediscovered in 2002.

Mythology
Main article:
Greek mythology
In the myths, Apollo is the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leto, his previous wife
[138]
or one of his mistresses. Apollo often appears in the myths, plays and hymns either directly or indirectly through his oracles. As Zeus' favorite son, he had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.
Birth
Leto with her children, by
William Henry Rinehart
Homeric Hymn to Apollo
Pregnant with the offsprings of Zeus, Leto wandered through many lands wanting to give birth to Apollo. However all the lands rejected her out of fear. Upon reaching Delos, Leto requested the island to shelter her, and that in return her son would bring fame and prosperity to the island. Delos then revealed to Leto that Apollo was rumoured to be the god who will "greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth". For this reason, all the lands were fearful and Delos feared that Apollo would cast her aside once he is be born. Hearing this, Leto swore on the river Styx that if she is allowed to give birth on the island, her son would honour Delos the most amongst all the other lands. Assured by this, Delos agreed to assist Leto. All goddesses except Hera also then came to aid Leto.
However, Hera had tricked
Eileithyia
, the goddess of childbirth, to stay on Olympus, due to which Leto was unable to give birth. The goddesses then convinced Iris to go bring Eileithyia by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards (8.2 m) long. Iris did accordingly and persuaded Eilithyia to step onto the island. Thus, clutching a palm tree, Leto finally gave birth after labouring for nine days and nine nights, with Apollo "leaping forth" from his mother's womb. The goddesses washed the new born, covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him. As Leto was unable to feed him,
Themis
, the goddess of divine law, fed him nectar and
ambrosia
. Upon tasting the divine food, the child broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of
lyre
and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind. He then started to walk, which caused the island to be filled with gold.
[139]
Callimachus' hymn to Delos
The island Delos used to be a woman named Asteria, who jumped into the waters to escape the advances of Zeus and became a free floating island of the same name. When Leto got pregnant, Hera was told that Leto will give birth to a son who would become to Zeus more dearer than Ares. Enraged by this, Hera watched over the heavens and sent out Ares and Iris to prevent Leto from giving birth on the earth. Ares stationed over the mainland and Iris over the islands, they both threatened all the lands and prevented them from helping Leto.
When Leto arrived to Thebes, fetal Apollo prophesied from his mother's womb that in the future, he would punish a slanderous woman in Thebes (Niobe), and so he did not want to be born there. Leto then went to Thessaly and sought out the help of the river nymphs whose father was the river Peneus. Though he was initially fearful and reluctant, Peneus later decided to let Leto give birth in his waters. He did not change his mind even when Ares produced a terrifying sound and threatened to hurl mountain peaks into the river. But in the end, Leto declined his help as she did not want him to suffer for her sake.
After being turned away from various lands, Apollo spoke again from the womb, asking Leto to take look at the floating island in front of her and expressing his wish to be born there. When Leto approached Asteria, all the other islands fled. But Asteria welcomed Leto without any fear of Hera. Walking on the island, she sat down against a palm tree and asked Apollo to be born. During the child birth, the swans circled the island seven times, due to which later on Apollo would play the seven stringed lyre. When Apollo finally "leapt forth" from his mother's womb, the nymphs of the island sung a hymn to Eilithyia that was heard to the heavens. The moment Apollo was born, the entire island, including the trees and the waters, became gold. Asteria bathed the new born, swaddled him and fed him with her breast milk. Since then, the island got rooted and was called as Delos.
Hera was no more angry as Zeus had managed to calm her down, and she held no grudge against Asteria due to the fact that Asteria had rejected Zeus in the past.
[140]
Leto holding Apollo, by Lazar Widmann
Pindar's fragments
Pindar is the earliest source who explicitly calls Apollo and Artemis as twins. Here, Asteria is also stated to be Leto's sister. Wanting escape Zeus' advances, she flung herself into the sea and became a floating rock called Ortygia until the twins were born.
[141]
When Leto stepped on the rock, four pillars with adamantine bases rose from the earth and held up the rock.
[142]
When Apollo and Artemis were born, their bodies shone radiantly and a chant was sung by Eileithyia and
Lachesis
, one of the  three
Moirai
.
[143]
Pseudo-Hyginus
Scorning the advances of Zeus, Asteria tranformed herself into a bird and jumped into a sea. From her, an island rose which was called Ortygia.
[144]
When Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant with Zeus' child, she decreed that Leto can give birth only in a place where sun does not shine. During this time, the monster Python also started hounding Leto with an intent of killing her, because he had foreseen his death coming at the hands of Leto's offspring. However, on Zeus' orders, Boreas carried away Leto and entrusted her to Poseidon. To protect her, Poseidon took her to the island Ortygia and covered it with waves so that the sun would not shine on it. Leto gave birth clinging to an olive tree and henceforth the island was called Delos.
[145]
Leto with Apollo and Artemis, by
Francesco Pozzi
Other variations of Apollo's birth include:
Aelian states that it took Leto twelve days and twelve nights to travel from Hyperborea to Delos.
[146]
Leto changed herself into a she-wolf before giving birth. This is given as the reason why Homer describes Apollo as the "wolf-born god".
[147]
[148]
Libanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive Leto, but by the will of Zeus Delos then became visible, and thus received Leto and the children.
[149]
According to Strabo, the
Curetes
helped Leto by creating loud noises with their weapons and thus frightening Hera, they concealed Leto's childbirth.
[150]
Theognis wrote that the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance when Apollo was born, and the Earth laughed with joy.
[151]
While in some accounts Apollo's birth itself fixed the floating Delos to the earth, there are accounts of Apollo securing Delos to the bottom of the ocean a little while later.
[152]
[153]
This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god.
Apollo was born on the seventh day (
ἑβδομαγενής
,
hebdomagenes
)
[154]
of the month
Thargelion
—according to Delian tradition—or of the month
Bysios
—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.
[19]
The general consensus is that
Artemis
was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo.
[155]
[156]
Hyperborea
Hyperborea
, the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted
Pythian games
.
[157]
There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called "the garden of Apollo". Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans,
[158]
[159]
leaving his shrine in Delphi under the care of Dionysus. His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time.
[160]
He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The
Theophania
festival was held in
Delphi
to celebrate his return.
[161]
However, Diodorus Silculus states that Apollo visited Hyperborea every nineteen years. This nineteen-year period was called by the Greeks as the ‘year of Meton', the time period in which the stars returned to their initial positions. And that visiting Hyperborea at that time, Apollo played on the cithara and danced continuously from the vernal equinox until the rising of the
Pleiades
(constellations).
[162]
Hyperborea was also Leto's birthplace. It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet
Lyceus
, meaning
wolf-like
. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman.
[163]
[164]
Shamans like
Abaris
and
Aristeas
were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.
In myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died mixed with the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the
Cyclopes
. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.
[165]
Childhood and youth
Growing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and
Aletheia
, the personification of truth.
[166]
Phoebe
, his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of
Delphi
to Apollo as a birthday gift.
[167]
As a four year old child, Apollo built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he came to be known as
Archegetes
, (
the founder of towns
) and guided men to build new cities.
[168]
To keep the child amused, the Delian nymphs ran around the altar beating it, and then with their hands tied behind their backs, bit an olive branch. It later became a custom for all the sailors who passed by the island to do the same.
[169]
From his father Zeus, Apollo received a golden headband and a chariot driven by swans.
[170]
[171]
In his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by the
Thriae
, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills.
[172]
The god Pan was also said to mentored him in the prophetic art.
[173]
Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught the humans the art of healing and archery.
[174]
Lycian peasants
Soon after giving birth to her twins, Leto fled from Delos fearing Hera. Upon reaching Lycia, her infants had drained all of their mother's milk and cried for more to satisfy their hunger. The exhausted mother then tried drinking from a near by lake but was stopped by some
Lycian peasants
. When she begged them to let her quench her thirst, the haughty peasants not only threatened her but also stirred the mud in the lake to dirty the waters. Angered by this, Leto turned them into frogs.
[175]
Latona and the Lycian Peasants by
Joshua Cristall
In a slightly varied version, Leto took her infants and crossed over to Lycia where she attempted to bathe her children in a spring she found there. But the local herdsmen drove her away. After that, some wolves found Leto and guided her to the river Xanthos, where Leto was able to bathe her children and quench her thirst. She then returned to the spring and turned the herdsmen into frogs.
[176]
Slaying of Python
Apollo victorious over the Python, by
François Gaspard Adam
Python
, a
chthonic
serpent-dragon, was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the
Delphic Oracle
.
In the Callimachus' hymn to Delos, fetal Apollo foresees the death of Python at his hands.
[177]
In the Homeric hymn to Apollo, Python was a female drakon and the nurse of the giant
Typhon
whom Hera had created to overthrow Zeus. She was described as a terrifying monster and a "bloody plague". Apollo, in his pursuit to establish his worship, came across Python and killed her with a single arrow shot from his bow. He let the corpse rot under the sun and declared himself the oracular deity of Delphi.
[178]
Other authors have Apollo kill the monster using a hundred arrows
[179]
[180]
or a thousand arrows.
[181]
Python pursuing Leto and her children, engravings on wood
According to Euripides, Leto had brought her twins to the cliffs of Parnassus shortly after giving birth to them. Upon seeing the monster there, Apollo, still a child being carried in his mother's arms, leapt forth and killed Python.
[182]
Some authors also mention that Python was killed for displaying lustful affections towards Leto.
[183]
[184]
In another account, Python chased pregnant Leto with an intent of killing her because his death was fated to come at the hands of Leto's child. However, he had to stop the chase when Leto came under the protection of Poseidon. After his birth, four days old Apollo killed the serpent with the bow and arrows gifted to him by Hephaestus and avenged the trouble given to his mother. The god then put the bones of the slain monster in a cauldron and deposited it in his temple.
[185]
This legend is also narrated as the origin of the cry "
Hië paian
". According to Athenaeus, Pyhton attacked Leto and her twins during their visit to Delphi. Taking Artemis into her arms, Leto climbed upon a rock and cried at Apollo to shoot the monster. The cry let out by her, "ιε, παῖ" ("Shoot, boy") later got slightly altered as "ἰὴ παιών" (
Hië paian
), an exclamation to avert evils.
[186]
Callimachus attributes the origin of this phrase to the Delphians, who let out the cry to encourage Apollo when the young god battled with Python.
[187]
Apollo killing the Python, by
Hendrik Goltzius
Strabo has recorded a slightly different version where Python was actually a cruel and lawless man who was also known by the name "Drakon". When Apollo was teaching the humans to cultivate fruits and civilise themselves, the residents of Parnassus complained to the god about Python. In response to their pleas, Apollo killed the man with his arrows. During the fight, the Parnassians shouted
"Hië paian"
to encourage the god.
[188]
Establishment of worship in Delphi
Continuing from his victory over Python, the Homeric hymn describes how the young god established his worship among the humans. As Apollo was pondering about what kind of men he should recruit to serve him, he spotted a ship full of Cretan merchants or pirates. He took the form of a dolphin and sprang aboard the ship. Whenever the oblivious crew members tried throwing the dolphin overboard, the god shook the ship until the crew was awed into submission. Apollo then created a breeze that directed the ship to Delphi. Upon reaching the land, he revealed himself as a god and initiated them as his priests. He instructed them to guard his temple and always keep righteousness in their hearts.
[189]
Alcaeus narrates the following account: Zeus, who had adorned his newborn son with a golden headband, also provided him with a chariot driven by swans and instructed Apollo to visit Delphi to establish his laws among the people. But Apollo disobeyed his father and went to the land of
Hyperborea
. The Delphians continuously sung paeans in his honour and pleaded him to come back to them. The god returned only after a year and then carried out Zeus' orders.
[190]
[191]
In other variations, the shrine at Delphi was simply handed over to Apollo by his grandmother Phoebe as a gift,
[192]
, or Themis herself inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi.
[193]
Phoebe
gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by
John Flaxman
However in many other accounts, Apollo had to overcome certain obstacles before he was able to establish himself at Delphi. Gaea came in conflict with Apollo for killing Python and claiming the Delphic oracle for himself. According to Pindar, she sought to banish Apollo to Tartarus as a punishment.
[194]
[195]
According to Euripides, soon after Apollo took the ownership of the oracle, Gaea started sending prophetic dreams to the humans. As a result, people stopped visiting Delphi to obtain prophecies. Troubled by this, Apollo went to Olympus and supplicated to Zeus. Zeus, admiring the ambitions of his young son, granted his request by putting an end to the dream visions. This sealed the role of Apollo as the oracular deity of Delphi.
[196]
Since Apollo had committed a blood crime, he also had to be purified. Pausanias has recorded two of the many variations of this purification. In one of them, both Apollo and Artemis fled to Sicyon and were purified there.
[197]
In the other tradition that had been prevalent among the Cretans, Apollo alone travelled to Crete and was purified by
Carmanor
.
[198]
In another account, the Argive king
Crotopus
was the one who performed the purification rites on Apollo alone.
[199]
According the Aristonous and Aelian, Apollo was purified by the will of Zeus in the
Vale of Tempe
.
[200]
Aristonous has continued the tale, saying that Apollo was escorted back to Delphi by Athena. As a token of gratitude, he later built a temple for Athena at Delphi, which served as a threshold for his own temple.
[201]
Upon reaching Delphi, Apollo convinced Gaea and Themis into handing over the seat of oracle to him. To celebrate this event, other immortals also graced Apollo with gifts - Poseidon gave him the land of Delphi, the Delphian nymphs gifted him the Corycian cave, and Artemis set her dogs to patrol and safeguard the land.
[202]
Some others have also said that Apollo was exiled and subjected to servitude under king
Admetus
as a means of punishment for the murder he had committed.
[203]
It was when he was serving as a cowherd under Admetus that the theft of the cattle by Hermes happened.
[204]
[205]
The servitude was said to have lasted for either one year,
[206]
[207]
or one great year (a cycle of eight years),
[208]
[209]
or nine years.
[210]
Plutarch, however, has mentioned a variation where Apollo was neither purified in Tempe nor banished to Earth as a servant for nine years, but was driven out to another world for nine great years. The god who returned was cleansed and purified, thus becoming a "true Phoebus - that is to say, clear and bright". He then took over the Delphic oracle, which had been under the care of Themis in his absence.
[211]
Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.
[212]
The Pythian games were also established by Apollo, either as funeral games to honor Python
[213]
[214]
or to celebrate his own victory.
[215]
[216]
[217]
. The
Pythia
was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies.
Tityus
Apollo slaying
Tityos
, Attic red-figure kylix, 460-450 BC
Tityus
was another giant who tried to rape Leto, either on his own accord when she  was on her way to Delphi
[218]
[219]
or at the order of Hera.
[220]
Leto called upon on her children who instantly slew the giant. Apollo, still a young boy, shot him with his arrows.
[221]
[222]
In some accounts, Artemis also joined him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows.
[223]
[224]
For this act, he was banished to tartarus and there he was pegged to the rock floor and stretched on an area of 9 acres (36,000 m
2
), while a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver
[225]
or his heart.
[226]
Another account recorded by Strabo says that Tityus was not a giant but a lawless man whom Apollo killed at the request of the residents.
[227]
Admetus
Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King
Admetus
, by
Felice Gianni
Admetus
was the king of
Pherae
, who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.
[159]
After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god.
Because Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo's mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins.
[228]
[159]
Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of
Alcestis
, the daughter of
King Pelias
,
[229]
[230]
by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus' chariot. He was present during their wedding to give his blessings. When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings, Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister.
[229]
When Apollo learnt of Admetus' untimely death, he convinced or tricked the
Fates
into letting Admetus live past his time.
[229]
[230]
According to another version, or perhaps some years later, when Zeus struck down Apollo's son
Asclepius
with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the
Cyclopes
, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.
[228]
Apollo would have been banished to
Tartarus
for this, but his mother
Leto
intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded with him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of
hard labor
once again under Admetus.
[228]
The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like
Ovid
and
Servius
.
Niobe
Niobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana
by
Pierre-Charles Jombert
The fate of
Niobe
was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.
[159]
Niobe was the queen of
Thebes
and wife of
Amphion
. She displayed
hubris
when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children (
Niobids
), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.
A devastated Niobe fled to
Mount Sipylos
in
Asia Minor
and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river
Achelous
. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.
When Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son
Nestor
the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.
[231]
Building the walls of Troy
Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by
Joachim von Sandrart
Once Apollo and
Poseidon
served under the Trojan king
Laomedon
in accordance with Zeus' words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris.
[232]
Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of Mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy.
[233]
Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid's account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre.
In
Pindar
's odes, the gods took a mortal named
Aeacus
as their assistant.
[234]
When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that
Troy
would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the
Aeacidae
(i.e. his son Telamon joined
Heracles
when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great-grandson
Neoptolemus
was present in the wooden horse that leads to the downfall of Troy).
However, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Poseidon sent the sea monster
Cetus
. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter
Hesione
(who would later be saved by
Heracles
).
During his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly.
[235]
Trojan War
Apollo sided with the Trojans during the
Trojan War
waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.
During the war, the Greek king
Agamemnon
captured
Chryseis
, the daughter of Apollo's priest
Chryses
, and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the
anger of Achilles
, which is the theme of the
Iliad
.
Apollo preceding
Hector
with his
Aegis
, and dispersing the Greeks, by
John Flaxman
Receiving the
aegis
from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as "the rouser of armies" because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.
When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.
Apollo prevents
Diomedes
from pursuing
Aeneas
When the Greek hero
Diomedes
injured the Trojan hero
Aeneas
,
Aphrodite
tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in
Troy
, where he was healed.
After the death of
Sarpedon
, a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep (
Hypnos
) and Death (
Thanatos
). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.
Apollo protecting Hector's body, by
John Flaxman
The Trojan hero
Hector
(who, according to some, was the god's own son by
Hecuba
[236]
) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior
Patroclus
tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse, shielding it from the rays of the
sun
.
Apollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son
Tenes
before the war began and brutally assassinated his son
Troilus
in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.
Finally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by
Paris
into
Achilles
' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.
Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including
Agenor
,
Polydamas
,
Glaucus
in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.
Nurturer of the young
Apollo
Kourotrophos
is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the
Muses
. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.
Chiron
, the abandoned
centaur
, was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.
Asclepius
in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts from his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.
Anius
, Apollo's son by
Rhoeo
, was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.
Iamus
was the son of Apollo and
Evadne
. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the
Moirai
to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.
[237]
Idmon
was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the
Argonauts
, he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.
[238]
Apollo adopted
Carnus
, the abandoned son of Zeus and
Europa
. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer.
When his son
Melaneus
reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess
Stratonice
to be his son's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed.
Apollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.
[239]
God of music
The music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.
Apollo,
Hyacinth
and
Cyparissus
singing and playing by
Alexander Ivanov
1831-1834
Immediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the
paean
, thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him.
Plato
said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses.
[240]
According to
Socrates
, ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called
Homopolon
before the
Homo
was replaced by
A
.
[241]
[242]
Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.
[159]
The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the "singers of Apollo". They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to
Hyperborea
.
[159]
Aelian
says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.
[243]
Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by
Andrea Appiani
Among the
Pythagoreans
, the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity.
[244]
[245]
[246]
Their belief was that music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the
music of the spheres
.
[247]
Apollo appears as the companion of the
Muses
, and as
Musagetes
("leader of Muses") he leads them in dance. They spend their time on
Parnassus
, which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like
Orpheus
and
Linus
.
Apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the
lyre
.
[248]
In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods, like the marriage of
Eros
and
Psyche
,
Peleus
and
Thetis
. He is a frequent guest of the
Bacchanalia
, and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the
maenads
and satyrs.
[249]
Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their
hubris
.
Detail of Apollo's lyre
Apollo's lyre
The invention of the lyre is attributed either to
Hermes
or to Apollo himself.
[250]
Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.
[251]
Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near
Pylos
, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a
tortoise
and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his
lyre
.
The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by
Noël Coypel
Upon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle.
[252]
Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre.
According to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to
Marsyas
. Hermes' lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention.
[253]
Contest with Pan
The musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by
Laurits Tuxen
Once
Pan
had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god
Tmolus
was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower,
Midas
, who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a
donkey
.
Contest with Marsyas
Marsyas
was a
satyr
who was punished by Apollo for his
hubris
. He had found an
aulos
on the ground, tossed away after being invented by
Athena
because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the
Muses
, or the nymphs of
Nysa
. Athena was also present to witness the contest.
Marsyas taunted Apollo for "wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts".
[254]
He also further said,
'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!'
[254]
The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could "do whatever he wanted" to the loser.
The contest between Apollo and
Marsyas
by
Palma il Giovane
According to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the
Nysiads
. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr.
[255]
Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo, by
Charles-André van Loo
According to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.
[256]
Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.
[257]
Apollo
flayed
the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near
Celaenae
in
Phrygia
for his
hubris
to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial
[258]
and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons
Linus
and
Orpheus
. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined
Cybele
in her wanderings to as far as
Hyperborea
.
[255]
[259]
Contest with Cinyras
Cinyras was a ruler of
Cyprus
, who was a friend of
Agamemnon
. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a
lyre
-playing contest with
Cinyras
, and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.
[260]
[261]
Apollon Raon,
Versailles
Patron of sailors
Apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with
Poseidon
. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for a safe journey.
When Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that were caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.
[262]
When the
Argonauts
faced a terrible storm,
Jason
prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed "
Anaphe
", which means "He revealed it".
[263]
Apollo helped the Greek hero
Diomedes
, to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius ("the embarker").
[264]
During the Trojan War,
Odysseus
came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest
Chryses
, and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp.
[265]
Arion
was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.
Wars
Trojan War
Apollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between
Achilles
and
Agamemnon
. He killed the Greek heroes
Patroclus
, Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being
Hector
. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps.

Telegony war
A war broke out between the
Brygoi
and the Thesprotians, who had the support of
Odysseus
. The gods Athena and
Ares
came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel. To stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle, Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them.
[266]
[267]
Indian war
When Zeus suggested that
Dionysus
defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods, Dionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to
India
along with his army of
Bacchantes
and
satyrs
. Among the warriors was
Aristaeus
, Apollo's son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm.
[268]
After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield.
[269]
Seeing several of his
nymphs
and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them.
[270]
He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus.
Theban war
During the war between the sons of
Oedipus
, Apollo favored
Amphiaraus
, a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus' last hours glorious by "lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam". When
Hypseus
tried to kill the hero with a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away from them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like
Melaneus
,
Antiphus
, Aetion, Polites and
Lampus
. At last, when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.
[271]
Slaying of giants
Apollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.
Gigantomachy
During the
gigantomachy
, Apollo and
Heracles
blinded the giant
Ephialtes
by shooting him in his eyes, Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right.
[272]
He also killed
Porphyrion
, the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.
[273]
Aloadae
The
Aloadae
, namely Otis and Ephialtes, were twin giants who decided to wage war upon the gods. They attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains, and threatened to fill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land.
[274]
They even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting them with arrows.
[275]
According to another tale, Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them; as they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.
[276]
Phorbas
Phorbas
was a savage giant king of
Phlegyas
who was described as having swine-like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped-off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.

François Boucher
In the first
Olympic games
, Apollo defeated
Ares
and became the victor in wrestling. He outran
Hermes
in the race and won first place.
[278]
Apollo divides months into summer and winter.
[279]
He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the
Hyperboreans
during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winter is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of
Dionysus
, and no prophecies were given during winters.
Periphas
Periphas
was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.
[280]
Molpadia and Parthenos
Molpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of
Rhoeo
, a former lover of Apollo. One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swine their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to
Hemithea
upon her deification.
[281]
Prometheus
Prometheus
was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. Seeing his plight, Apollo pleaded with Zeus to release the kind Titan, while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes. Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of the goddesses, finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus.

Apollo crowning the arts, by
Nicolas-Guy Brenet
Heracles
After
Heracles
(then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king
Eurystheus
for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him Heracles.
[283]
Heracles and Apollo struggling over the Hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)
To complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the
Ceryneian Hind
, a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring back it alive. After chasing the hind for one year, the animal eventually got tired, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon, Heracles captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later.
[284]
After he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in the hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under
Omphale
, queen of
Lydia
for one year in order to purify himself.
After their reconciliation, Apollo and Heracles together founded the city of Gythion.
[285]
Plato's concept of soulmates
A long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and four legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly.
Otis
and
Ephialtes
even dared to scale
Mount Olympus
.
To check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the
abdomen
, and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call
navel
today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment.
[286]
"As he [Zeus] cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn... Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre [of the belly] which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few wrinkles, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state.
The rock of Leukas
Leukatas was believed to be a white-colored rock jutting out from the island of
Leukas
into the sea. It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates. A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love.
[287]
Once, Aphrodite fell deeply in love with
Adonis
, a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar. Heartbroken, Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas. When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos, she confided in him her love and sorrow. Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love for Hera.
[288]
Another tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order to relieve himself. After jumping, he fell into the net of a fisherman in which, when he was pulled out, he found a box filled with gold. He fought with the fisherman and took the gold, but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others.
[288]
It was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil. However, a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island.
[289]
[288]
This was the same rock from which, according to a legend, Sappho took her suicidal leap.

Female lovers
Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.
[291]
Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

Apollo and Daphne
Apollo and Daphne
by
Bernini
in the
Galleria Borghese
Daphne
was a
nymph
who scorned Apollo's advances and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and
Gaia
helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place.
[292]
According to Roman poet
Ovid
, the chase was brought about by
Cupid
, who hit Apollo with a golden arrow of love and Daphne with a leaden arrow of hatred.
[293]
The myth explains the origin of the
laurel
and the connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves, which his priestess employed at
Delphi
. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the
Pythian games

Male lovers
Apollo and Hyacinthus
, by
Carlo Cesio
Death of Hyacinth, by
Alexander Kiselyov
, 1850-1900
Hyacinth (or Hyacinthus), a beautiful and athletic
Spartan
prince, was one of Apollo's favourite lovers.
[302]
The pair was practicing throwing the
discus
when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous
Zephyrus
and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a
flower
named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection
αἰαῖ
, meaning
alas
.
[303]
He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival
Hyacinthia
was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.
[304]
Another male lover was
Cyparissus
, a descendant of
Heracles
. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a
javelin
as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the
Cypress
named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

Apollo and
Cyparissus
, by
Jean-Pierre Granger
(1779-1840)
Admetus
, the king of Pherae, was also Apollo's lover.
[306]
[307]
During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years,
[308]
Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by
Callimachus
of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was "fired with love" for Admetus.
[159]
Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo's lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him.
[309]
Latin poet
Ovid
in his
Ars Amatoria
said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus.
[310]
Tibullus
describes Apollo's love to the king as
servitium amoris
(slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice. He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus. His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family.
[311]
Apollo visiting Admetus, by
Nicolas-Antoine Taunay
, 19th century
Oh how often his sister (Diana) blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields!....often Latona lamented when she saw her son's disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno, his step-mother...
[312]
When Admetus wanted to marry princess
Alcestis
, Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the
Moirai
to postpone Admetus' death once.

, a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.
[313]
Other male lovers of Apollo include:
Adonis
, who is said to have been the lover of both Apollo and Aphrodite. He behaved as a man with Aphrodite and as a woman with Apollo.
[314]
Atymnius
,
[315]
otherwise known as a beloved of
Sarpedon
Boreas
, the god of North winds
[316]

Children
Apollo sired many children, from mortal women and nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings.
Apollo Entrusting
Chiron
with the Education of Aescalapius
Asclepius
is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god.
Aristaeus
was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese-making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon humanity. The
Corybantes
were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.
The sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes
Hector
and
Troilus
, as well as
Tenes
, the king of
Tenedos
, all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.
Apollo's children who became musicians and bards include
Orpheus
,
Linus
,
Ialemus
,
Hymenaeus
,
Philammon
,
Eumolpus
and
Eleuther
. Apollo fathered 3 daughters,
Apollonis
,
Borysthenis
and
Cephisso
, who formed a group of minor Muses, the "Musa Apollonides".
[322]
They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre.

Failed love attempts
Marpessa
was kidnapped by
Idas
but was loved by Apollo as well.
Zeus
made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.
[391]
Sinope
, a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.
Bolina
was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph, saving her life.
Castalia
was a
nymph
whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the
spring
at Delphi, at the base of
Mt. Parnassos
, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.
[392]
Cassandra
, was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.
The
Sibyl of Cumae
like Cassandra promised Apollo her love if he would give her a boon. The Sibyl took a handful of sand and asked Apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands. Apollo granted her wish, but Sibyl went back on her word. Although Sibyl did live an extended life as Apollo had promised, he did not give her agelessness along with it, so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained.
[393]
Hestia
, the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.
In one version of the prophet
Tiresias
's origins, he was originally a woman who promised Apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons. Apollo gave her her wish, but then she went back on her word and refused him. Apollo in anger turned her into a man.

Female counterparts
Apollo and Artemis, by
Gavin Hamilton
Artemis
Apollo (left) and
Artemis
.
Brygos
(potter signed), tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC,
Musée du Louvre
.
Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is
thea apollousa
, that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo.
[
citation needed
]
However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,
[395]
which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the
Hellenic period
.
[
citation needed
]
Artemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.
[396]
The laurel (
daphne
) was sacred to both.
Artemis Daphnaia
had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.
[397]
Apollo Daphnephoros
had a temple in
Eretria
, a "place where the citizens are to take the oaths".
[398]
In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or
Helios
, Artemis was naturally regarded as
Selene
or the moon.
Hecate
Hecate's procession by the witches, by
Jusepe de Ribera
Hecate
, the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers -
Leto
and
Asteria
- are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets,
Hecatos
, is the masculine form of Hecate, and both names mean "working from afar". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.
[

]
If Hecate is the "gate-keeper", Apollo
Agyieus
is the "door-keeper". Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.
[399]
Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus, by
Arnold Houbraken
The oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.
[399]
Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.
Athena
As a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of
Athena
. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role of protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principal goddess of
Athens
, Apollo was the principal god of
Sparta
.
[400]
As patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the
Muses
, the former a much more frequent companion than the latter.
[401]
Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus.
[402]
In the Trojan War, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the
aegis
like Athena usually does.
[403]
Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.
[404]
Apollo in the
Oresteia
In
Aeschylus
'
Oresteia
trilogy,
Clytemnestra
kills her husband, King
Agamemnon
because he had sacrificed their daughter
Iphigenia
to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son,
Orestes
, is to kill Clytemnestra and
Aegisthus
, her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the
Erinyes
or Furies (female personifications of
vengeance
).
Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the
matricide
was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's
supplicant
. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.
Roman Apollo
The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.
[405]
As a quintessentially
Greek god
, Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as
Phoebus
.
[

There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the
kings of Rome
during the reign of
Tarquinius Superbus
.
[406]
On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's
first temple
at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the "Apollinare".
[407]
During the
Second Punic War
in 212 BCE, the
Ludi Apollinares
("Apollonian Games") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.
[408]
In the time of
Augustus
, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.
[409]
[405]
After the
Battle of Actium
, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted
quinquennial
games in his honour.
[410]
He also erected
a new temple
to the god on the
Palatine hill
.
[411]
Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and
Diana
formed the culmination of the
Secular Games
, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.
[412]
Festivals
The chief Apollonian festival was the
Pythian Games
held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great
Panhellenic Games
. Also of major importance was the
Delia
held every four years on Delos.
Athenian annual festivals included the
Boedromia
,
Metageitnia
,
[413]
Pyanepsia
, and
Thargelia
.
Spartan annual festivals were the
Carneia
and the
Hyacinthia
.
Thebes
every nine years held the
Daphnephoria
.
Attributes and symbols
Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and
arrow
. Other attributes of his included the
kithara
(an advanced version of the common
lyre
), the
plectrum
and the sword. Another common emblem was the
sacrificial tripod
, representing his prophetic powers. The
Pythian Games
were held in Apollo's honor every four years at
Delphi
. The
bay laurel
plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the
crown of victory
at these games.

cicadas
(symbolizing music and song),
ravens
,
hawks

crows
(Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers),

griffins
, mythical eagle-lion hybrids of Eastern origin.
[405]
Homer
and
Porphyry
wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger.
[415]
[414]
In many myths Apollo is transformed into a hawk.
[416]
[417]
[418]
In addition,
Claudius Aelianus
wrote that in
Ancient Egypt
people believed that hawks were sacred to the god
[419]
and that according to the ministers of Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called "hawk-keepers" (ἱερακοβοσκοί) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god.
[420]
Eusebius
wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in Egypt and that the city's symbol is a man with a hawklike face (
Horus
).
[421]
Claudius Aelianus
wrote that Egyptians called Apollo
Horus
in their own language.
[419]
Apollo Citharoedus
("Apollo with a kithara"),
Musei Capitolini
, Rome
As god of colonization,
[422]
Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750-550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped
Cretan
or
Arcadian
colonists found the city of
Troy
. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction:
Hittite
cuneiform
texts mention an Asia Minor god called
Appaliunas
or
Apalunas
in connection with the city of
Wilusa
attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek
Ilion
by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of
Lykegenes
can simply be read as "born in Lycia", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a
folk etymology
).
In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of
Dionysus
, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives
Apollonian and Dionysian
. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for
Hyperborea
, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the
Borghese Vase
.
Apollo is often associated with the
Golden Mean
. This is the Greek
ideal
of
moderation
and a
virtue
that opposes
gluttony
.
In antiquity, Apollo was associated with the planet Mercury. The ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before. The morning planet was called Apollo, and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they were the same, thereupon the name 'Mercury/Hermes' was kept, and 'Apollo' was dropped.

Apollo in the arts
Statue of Apollo at the
Academy of Athens
Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the
Renaissance
. The earliest Greek word for a statue is "delight" (
ἄγαλμα
,
agalma
), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision.
Maurice Bowra
notices that the Greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.
[423]
The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity.
[424]
The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment.
[425]
The statues of Apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength. "In the balance and relation of their limbs, such figures express their whole character, mental and physical, and reveal their central being . ,the radiant reality of youth in its heyday".
[426]
Archaic sculpture
Numerous free-standing statues of male youths from
Archaic Greece
exist, and were once thought to be representations of Apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals.
[427]
In 1895, V. I. Leonardos proposed the term
kouros
("male youth") to refer to those from
Keratea
; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format.
[428]
[429]
The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two figures from the
Ionic
sanctuary on the island of
Delos
. Such statues were found across the Greek-speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of
Apollo Ptoios
,
Boeotia
alone.
[430]
Significantly more rare are the life-sized bronze statues. One of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as "a miracle" by Ernst Homann-Wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze,
Piraeus Apollo
. It was found in
Piraeus
, a
port city
close to Athens, and is believed to have come from north-eastern
Peloponnesus
. It is the only surviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue.

Walter Runeberg

Ateneum

,

The famous
Apollo of Mantua
and its variants are early forms of the
Apollo Citharoedus
statue type, in which the god holds the
cithara
, a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre, in his left arm. While none of the Greek originals have survived, several Roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist, of which an example is the
Apollo Barberini
.
Hellenistic Greece-Rome
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a cithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the
Apollo Lykeios
and
Apollo Sauroctonos
types). The
Apollo Belvedere
is a
marble
sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of
Classical Antiquity
for Europeans, from the
Renaissance
through the 19th century. The marble is a
Hellenistic
or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor
Leochares
, made between 330 and 320 BCE.
[432]
The life-size so-called "
Adonis
" found in 1780 on the site of a
villa suburbana
near the
Via Labicana
in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from
El Djem
, Roman
Thysdrus
, he is identifiable as
Apollo Helios
by his effulgent
halo
, though now even a god's divine
nakedness
is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later
Empire
.
[

]
Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from
Hadrumentum
, is in the museum at
Sousse
.
[433]
The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling
hair cut
in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict
Alexander the Great
.
[434]
Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.
Modern reception
Apollo often appears in
modern
and
popular culture
due to his status as the god of music, dance and poetry.

Dance and music
Apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture.
Percy Bysshe Shelley
composed a "Hymn of Apollo" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of
Igor Stravinsky
's
Apollon musagète
(1927-1928). In 1978, the Canadian band
Rush
released
an album
with songs
"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom"/"Dionysus: Bringer of Love"
.
[435]
Books
Apollo has been portrayed in modern literature, such as when
Charles Handy
, in
Gods of Management
(1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of
organizational culture
. Apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason, and
bureaucracy
prevail.

impulses, where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity.
Friedrich Nietzsche
argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable.

Ricky Plant
(born 23 November 1977) is a British
ice hockey
player from
Telford
,
UK
. He plays right wing.
Career
[
edit
]
Rick Plant began his career with local side
Telford Tigers
in 1994.  He spent 3 years away from his local side with
Milton Keynes Kings
,
Blackburn Hawks
,
Swindon Icelords
and
Guildford Flames
.
He returned to Telford for a year in 98/99, before joining the Guildford Flames again where he played until 2004.
In March 2004 he tested positive for "A banned Class 'A' stimulant".  He was banned for 18 months from the game.  Flames who have a very much admired '
' program vowed to give Plant all the 'assistance' he needed in the 'unfortunate circumstances'.
[1]
In September 2005, the Flames announced that Rick Plant would be joining the team again after serving his ban.  He swiftly showed fans that he had lost none of his scoring ability scoring 72 points in 47
EPIHL
league games, followed by 53 points in 2006-2007.
He signed up to play for Guildford for the 2007-08 season and assigned the club captaincy.
[2]
Scoring 22+42, he slowly gained confidence as a captain in taking charge on the ice. The Club confirmed in late May 2008 that he would be returning for his 10th year in a Flames Shirt for the 2008-09 season, coming off his first as a title winning captain.
[3]
Plant is the Flames top scoring British player of
All-time
, and third overall. On 31 January Plant became only the 2nd Flames player of all time to achieve 500 points, with an assist against the Wightlink Raiders.

Radcliff
is a
home rule-class city
[4]
in
Hardin County
,
Kentucky
, in the United States. The population was 21,692 at the
2010 census
,
[5]
and in 2019 the estimated population was 22,914.
[6]
It is included in the
Elizabethtown-Fort Knox Metropolitan Area
.
Its economy is largely dominated by the adjacent U.S. Army base
Fort Knox
and by the nearby city of
Elizabethtown
. Radcliff's population previously fluctuated greatly depending on the deployments of the units at the base, but the
BRAC reorganization
of 2005, and the quartering of the
U.S. Army
's
Human Resources Command
to Fort Knox has created a larger and more stable population.
[7]
Geography
[
edit
]
Radcliff is in northern Hardin County at
(37.829918, -85.945541).
[8]
It is bordered to the north by Fort Knox and to the west by
Vine Grove
.
U.S. Route 31W
runs through the east side of the city, leading north 34 miles (55 km) to
Louisville
and south 11 miles (18 km) to Elizabethtown.
According to the
United States Census Bureau
, Radcliff has a total area of 12.4 square miles (32.2 km
2
), of which 12.4 square miles (32.1 km
2
) are land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km
2
), or 0.25%, are water.
[5]
The former unincorporated community of Rogersville, named for a local family, is in the southern part of Radcliff along US 31W and
Kentucky Route 447
.
[9]
History
[
edit
]
Incorporated in 1956, Radcliff was first settled in 1919, when Horace McCullum subdivided lots along Wilson Avenue and sold them at auction to the highest bidder. McCullum named the new community after Major William Radcliffe, head of the
Quartermaster Corps
at the newly established Camp Henry Knox. After selling the general store he had opened in the new town, McCullum no longer played a role in its development.
The next significant step in Radcliff's history took place during the 1930s when
Fort Knox
expanded and dislocated the towns of Stithton and New Stithton, causing various residents and businesses of those communities to move to Radcliff. During
World War II
, thousands of soldiers trained at Fort Knox and spent their leisure hours at the
USO
in Radcliff.
Hardin Water District No. 1 was formed in 1953, and became a reality in 1955 with the sale of bonds to finance the project. Today, the water district is the principal source of fresh water to all Hardin County. Radcliff's fire department was established in 1955, with Joseph B. Hutcherson the first fire chief. The Radcliff Civic Club was also organized that year. The city incorporated in March 1956 as a 6th-class city. Radcliff Police Department was formed with officers paid on a fee basis. The population was estimated at 800. Radcliff's population growth over the last 50 years is due to the transient military population, and trends are showing a plateau and decline. At one time, Radcliff was larger than Elizabethtown, but that was short-lived after the 2000 census and more so after the BRAC transformation at the beginning of the 21st century. Starting with 800 in 1956, the Census Bureau reported populations of 3,381 in 1960, 8,281 in 1970, 14,519 in 1980, and 21,961 in 2000.
In 1988, a youth group from the First
Assembly of God
in Radcliff was involved in the worst drunk-driving incident in U.S. history, a
bus collision
in which a drunk driver going the wrong way on
Interstate 71
hit the group's vehicle, killing 27 people.
[10]
[11]
In mid-October 2011, the city voted to approve alcohol sales, which began in January 2012.
Former Kentucky state representative
Mike Weaver
was elected mayor in 2014 and took office in 2015 for a four-year term. City council members Barbara Baker, Stan Holmes, Edward L. Palmer, T. W. Shortt, Kim Thompson and Chris Yates were also elected in 2014 and took office in 2015, each for a two-year term.
The November 8, 2016, general election for Radcliff City Council ended with all current councilmembers reelected except Shortt, who had run for Kentucky State Representative. Radcliff community leader and businesswoman Tanya Seabrooks was elected to fill the seat Shortt vacated, defeating five other candidates. She took the oath of office in December 2016 for a two-year term. Shortt was defeated in his bid for state representative by the incumbent,
Dean Schamore
.
In the 2020 general election for the City Council, all but two incumbent members of the city council were re-elected. Barbara Baker lost her seat after finishing eighth in the race and Edward Palmer decided not to run for re-election. The two newly elected to the council were Terry Owens who finished second and Toshie Murrell who finished fifth.
[12]
Incumbent Tanya Seabrooks was re-elected, having finished fourth, but died a month after the election.
[13]
In a special-called meeting on January 7, 2021, the city council unanimously appointed Aundra Lett Jackson, who finished seventh in the race, as the council's sixth member to serve Seabrooks' term.
[14]
The 2022 election for the Radcliff City Council saw incumbents Terry Owens, Kim Thompson, Pamela DeRoche, and Toshie Murrell win re-election. Chris Yates did not run for another term on the city council, instead running as a Democratic Party candidate in the magisterial election for the first district of the Hardin County fiscal court, where he defeated independent candidate Edward Palmer. Aundra Lett Jackson did not win enough votes to secure a second term. Jerry Brown, who had previously served five terms as a member of the city council, and Michelle Harmon, an owner of an ice cream shop and a volunteer in the community, won seats on the city council.
[15]
Brown and Harmon were sworn in as members of the City Council on December 20, 2022.

Lab Quarters
, also DRDO Township and
Kanchanbagh
, is a colony in
Old City, Hyderabad
,
Telangana
, to accommodate the employees working in the Defence Laboratories of
DRDO
. It is well connected with the city, the Midhani depot being just adjacent to it. Lab Quarters is one of the largest colonies in Hyderabad, comparable to those of
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited
and
Kukatpally Housing Board
.
It is a very green area and isolated from the mundane traffic and pollution of the rest of the city. It is close to Santosh Nagar colony and babanagar area. Some popular healthcare centres like the
Central Government Health Scheme
Dispensary, Owaisi Hospital and the
Apollo DRDO hospitals
are located nearby. The main commercial places are the shopping complex, community hall, parks, mess (general and for officers). Lab Quarters has excellent educational institutions like the Defence Laboratories school and the
Kendriya Vidyalaya
Kanchanbagh. While the former is a private venture, the latter is managed by the all-India Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and financed by the DRDO Laboratories around it. It has got a temple inside the Township.
It also has several grounds, the largest of which is the one at the Kendriya Vidyalaya.
The township contains one helipad which becomes functional when receiving VIPs like the President, Prime Minister and other important dignitaries.
This township was once the residential address for late president and India's premier missile man Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. He was serving as the director of Defence Research and Development Laboratory, which has since been renamed in his memory.
Recently introduced sports complex in the township's houses are a swimming pool, badminton courts, and a table tennis conclave.Jump to content

Reception
[
edit
]
The
AllMusic
review by
Scott Yanow
stated: "The performances are mostly concise, emphasize ensembles (it is difficult to believe that the two rhythm sections are playing simultaneously) and are sometimes surprisingly mellow although there are intense moments. None of the original pieces are that memorable but the overall mood is haunting and at times jubilant. An intriguing addition to Roscoe Mitchell's discography".

AllMusic
[5]
Upon release,
Joe Thomas, New Man
received generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Thomas Inskeep from
AllMusic
gave the album three stars out of five and wrote that "on his seventh album, R&B crooner Joe keeps doing what he's always done best: sings sexy, woman-centric midtempo jams. There are no dramatic change-ups here - much as the likes of
Barry White
,
Teddy Pendergrass
, and
Keith Sweat
before him, Joe's not even trying to cross over to any audience other than adult black women [...]  The best thing about
Joe Thomas, New Man
is its consistency, which it's got in spades.
[5]
Mark Edward Nero, writing for
About.com
, remarked that "And although his latest album is called
Joe Thomas, New Man
, this is for the most part the same singer whose music women have gone wild over for more than a decade. What's different though, is that Joe sounds rejuvenated on this album [...] To be honest, there's not a whole lot of new ground covered on the album, but Joe's the type of artist who doesn't need to reinvent himself to be or stay successful."

History
[
edit
]
Hungary played their first
official
match against
East Germany
in
Érd
in 1990, losing 3-7, but they played a number of unofficial matches prior to this, mainly against a likewise unofficial
Austrian
team, including a match in
Győr
on 1 May 1983.
[2]
Hungary first entered the
qualifiers for the 1995 World Cup
in 1993, being at the wrong end of an 8-67 scoreline against Israel.
Things went better in the
1999 qualifying rounds
, where they beat Lithuania and Luxembourg, but lost to Andorra and Sweden.
In the
2003 qualifiers
, they won against Andorra and Bulgaria, but lost to Bosnia, Yugoslavia (as Serbia was then still known), and Switzerland.
The
2007 qualifying
was their worst performance to date, losing all four matches played, including a 9-63 thumping by Spain.

Strip
[
edit
]
The badge on the shirt derives from the
Csodaszarvas
, a
mythological stag
that led the ancient Hungarian people to the
Pannonian Basin
.
In the Austria match of 1983, they played in presumably white jerseys with either a black or dark green hoop, black shorts, and either black or dark green socks with white tops. After the MRgSz was established, the team reverted to the flag colors of red, white, and green, with the current strip consisting of red shirts and shorts and green socks.
Grounds
[
edit
]
Hungary plays its home games at the Budapest Rugby Center in
Kincsem Park
. Most games, before the new stadium was built in 2019, used to be held in
Esztergom
.

Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit C
is an
enzyme
that in humans is encoded by the
PIGC
gene
.
[5]
[6]
[7]
This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum associated protein that is involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor biosynthesis. The GPI lipid anchor is a glycolipid found on many blood cells and serves to anchor proteins to the cell surface. The encoded protein is one subunit of the GPI N-acetylglucosaminyl (GlcNAc) transferase that transfers GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Two alternatively spliced transcripts that encode the same protein have been found for this gene. A pseudogene on chromosome 11 has also been characterized.

History of Neredmet
[
edit
]
It was founded in 1578 AD, But population increased from development of RK Puram lake also known as (Munkidigan Cheruvu). Old Neredmet Village has its own fort, walls, watch tower ruins, at
Neredmet Gaddi (Fort)
.
By the early 1800s, the Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (EME), which is presently the Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME), had been set up at
Trimulgherry
. The engineers and electricians who worked here needed water, so RK Puram Lake was commissioned by the
Nizam
and dug up in the mid-1800s, occupying a space of around 100 acres.
[1]
Speaking to TNM, Murali Chemuturi, a writer and long-time resident of the area, narrates, “Mudfort, which is now just the name of an area, was the first place where the East India Company built its garrison. Over time, the garrison expanded, and soon it had spread all the way up to Bolaram.”
By the early 1800s, the Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (EME), which is presently the Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME), had been set up.
Though it is now a populated area in the city, this was the time that people first settled in then Neredmet village.
“The engineers and electricians who worked there needed two main services. First, they had dry toilets and needed someone for manual scavenging, and secondly, they needed milk and food. For the first, they hired some Scheduled Caste people from Tamil Nadu and for the second purpose, they hired Yadavs (a cattle-breeding caste), from Uttar Pradesh,” Murali says.
“The two groups were housed nearby, and while Neredmet became the village
RK Puram was the hamlet where the SC persons stayed,” he adds.
All three of these groups needed water, so the RK Puram Lake was commissioned by the Nizam and dug up in the mid-1800s, occupying a space of around 100 acres.
After the sepoy mutiny in 1857, the British continued to expand aggressively, and the area's population began to grow.
The lake remained a major source of drinking water and largely clean, until the late 1960s, when the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) was established.
“There was no shortage of water, which is why the old houses in RK Puram have no well or borewell. In 1965, Sainik Nagar was the first colony to be allotted. Despite this, the lake remained clean, as the colony remained downstream of the lake,” says Murali.
“After ECIL came up, the politicians of the time laid a road right through the lake, to create a shortcut. In 1976, the lake flooded the road, following which it was raised by 5 feet by the gram panchayat with the help of mud and stones,” he adds.
According to locals, this was when a large portion of the lake was killed, as the water that was cut off from the rest of the lake, was eventually dumped with debris and flattened.
“However, it was only in the mid-80s that things started going downhill, as several colonies like GK Colony, Sri Colony, Bank Colony and Bhagat Singh Nagar were built upstream, and untreated sewage started flowing directly into the lake,” Murali says.

Naqsh-e Jahan at night
In 1598, when
Shah Abbas
decided to move the capital of his empire from the north-western city of
Qazvin
to the central city of
Isfahan
, he initiated what would become one of the greatest programmes in Persian history; the complete remaking of the city. By choosing the central city of Isfahan, with the
Zāyande roud
("The
life-giving river
"), lying as an oasis of intense cultivation in the midst of a vast area of arid landscape, he distanced his capital from any future assaults by the
Ottomans
, the arch rival of the Safavids,
[4]
and the
Uzbeks
, and at the same time gained more control over the
Persian Gulf
, which had recently become an important trading route for the Dutch and British
East India Companies
.
[5]
The chief architect of this colossal task of urban planning was
Shaykh Bahai
(Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili),
[6]
who focused the programme on two key features of Shah Abbas's master plan: the
Chahar Bagh avenue
, flanked at either side by all the prominent institutions of the city, such as the residences of all foreign dignitaries, and the Naqsh-e Jahan Square ("
Exemplar of the World
").
[7]
Prior to the Shah's ascent to power, Persia had a decentralized power-structure, in which different institutions battled for power, including both the military (the
Qizilbash
) and governors of the different provinces making up the empire. Shah Abbas wanted to undermine this political structure, and the recreation of Isfahan, as a Grand capital of Persia, was an important step in centralizing the power.
[8]
The ingenuity of the square, or
Maidān
, was that, by building it, Shah Abbas would gather the three main components of power in Persia in his own backyard; the power of the clergy, represented by the Masjed-e Shah, the power of the merchants, represented by the Imperial Bazaar, and of course, the power of the Shah himself, residing in the
Ali Qapu
Palace.
Maidan - The Royal Square
[
edit
]
The Maidan was where the Shah and the people met. Built as a two-story row of shops, flanked by impressive architecture, and eventually leading up to the northern end, where the Imperial Bazaar was situated, the square was a busy arena of entertainment and business, exchanged between people from all corners of the world. As Isfahan was a vital stop along the
Silk Road
, goods from many countries of the world, spanning from Portugal in the West, to the
Middle Kingdom
in the East, found its ways to the hands of gifted merchants, who knew how to make the best profits out of them.
The Royal Square was also admired by Europeans who visited Isfahan during
Shah Abbas'
reign.
Pietro Della Valle
conceded that it outshone the
Piazza Navona
in his native Rome.
During the day, much of the square was occupied by the tents and stalls of tradesmen, who paid a weekly rental to the government. There were also entertainers and actors. For the hungry, there were readily available cooked foods or slices of melon, while cups of water were handed out for free by water-carriers paid for by the shop-keepers. At the entrance to the Imperial Bazaar, there were coffee-houses, where people could relax over a cup of fresh coffee and a water-pipe.
[9]
These shops can still be found today, although the drink in fashion for the past century has been tea, rather than coffee. At dusk, the shop-keepers packed up, and the huzz and buzz of tradesmen and eager shoppers bargaining over the prices of goods would be given over to
dervishes
, mummers, jugglers, puppet-players, acrobats and prostitutes.
[10]
Every now and then the square would be cleared off for public ceremonies and festivities. One such occasion would be the annual event of
Nowruz
, the Persian New Year. Also, the national Persian sport of
polo
could be played in the maidan, providing the Shah, residing in the Ali Qapu palace, and the busy shoppers with some entertainment.
[11]
[12]
The marble goal-posts, erected by Shah Abbas, still stand at either end of the Maydan.
Under Abbas, Isfahan became a very cosmopolitan city, with a resident population of Turks, Georgians, Armenians, Indians, Chinese and a growing number of Europeans. Shah Abbas brought in some 300 Chinese artisans to work in the royal workshops and to teach the art of porcelain-making. The Indians were present in very large numbers, housed in the many
caravanserais
that were dedicated to them,
[13]
and they mainly worked as merchants and money-changers. The Europeans were there as merchants, Roman Catholic missionaries, artists and craftsmen. Even soldiers, usually with expertise in artillery, would make the journey from Europe to Persia to make a living.
[14]
The Portuguese ambassador,
De Gouvea
, once stated that:
“The people of Isfahan are very open in their dealings with foreigners, having to deal every day with people of several other nations.”
[15]
Also, many historians have wondered about the peculiar orientation of the maidān. Unlike most buildings of importance, this square did not lie in alignment with
Mecca
, so that when entering the entrance-portal of the Shah Mosque, one makes, almost without realising it, the half-right turn which enables the main court within to face Mecca.Donald Wilber gives the most plausible explanation to this; the vision of Shaykh Bahai was for the mosque to be visible wherever in the maydān a person was situated. Had the axis of the maydān coincided with the axis of Mecca, the dome of the mosque would have been concealed from view by the towering entrance-portal leading to it. By creating an angle between them, the two parts of the building, the entrance-portal and the dome, are in perfect view for everyone within the square to admire.

Masjed-e Shah - The Pinnacle of Safavid Architecture
[

Main article:
Shah Mosque (Isfahan)
The Crown Jewel in the Naghs-e Jahan Square was the
Masjed-e Shah
, which would replace the much older
Jameh Mosque
in conducting the Friday prayers. To achieve this, the Shah Mosque was constructed not only with vision of grandeur, having the largest dome in the city, but Shaykh Bahai also planned the construction of a religious school and a winter-mosque clamped at either side of it.
[17]
The Lotfollah Mosque
[
edit
]
Main article:
Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque
Of the four monuments that dominated the perimeter of the Naqsh-e Jahan square, the
Lotfollah Mosque
, opposite the palace, was the first to be built. The purpose of this mosque was for it to be a private mosque of the royal court, unlike the Masjed-e Shah, which was meant for the public.
[18]
For this reason, the mosque does not have any minarets and is of a smaller size. Indeed, few Westerners at the time of the Safavids even paid any attention to this mosque, and they certainly did not have access to it. It wasn't until centuries later, when the doors were opened to the public, that ordinary people could admire the effort that Shah Abbas had put into making this a sacred place for the ladies of his harem, and the exquisite tile-work, which is far superior to those covering the Shah Mosque.

Ālī Qāpū
Ali Qapu (pronounced, ah-lee gah-pooh) is in effect but a pavilion that marks the entrance to the vast royal residential quarter of the Safavid Isfahan which stretched from the Maidan Naqsh-e Jahan to the Chahar Bagh Boulevard. The name is made of two elements: "Ali", Arabic for exalted, and "Qapu" Turkic for portal or royal threshold. The compound stands for "Exalted Porte". This name was chosen by the Safavids to rival the Ottomans' celebrated name for their court : Bab-i Ali, or the "Sublime Porte"). It was here that the great monarch used to entertain noble visitors, and foreign ambassadors. Shah Abbas, here for the first time celebrated the Nowruz (New Year's Day) of 1006 AH / 1597 A.D. A large and massive rectangular structure, the Ali Qapu is 48 m (157 ft) high and has six floors, fronted with a wide terrace whose ceiling is inlaid and supported by wooden columns.
On the sixth floor, the royal reception and banquets were held. The largest rooms are found on this floor. The stucco decoration of the banquet hall abounds in motif of various vessels and cups. The sixth floor was popularly called (the music room) as it was here that various ensembles performed music and sang songs. From the upper galleries, the Safavid ruler watched
polo
games, maneuvers and horse-racing below in the Naqsh-e Jahan square.

(12 May 1840 - 6 March 1915), styled
Viscount Chelsea
from 1864 to 1873, was a British

politician.
[2]
[3]
Background and education
[
edit
]
Cadogan was the eldest son of
Henry Cadogan, 4th Earl Cadogan
, by his wife Mary, daughter of Reverend Gerald Wellesley, younger brother of
Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington
.
[2]
He was born in the
city of Durham
and baptised at St James's, Westminster, London. He was educated at
Eton College
and
Christ Church, Oxford
.
[4]
[5]
Military service
[
edit
]
As Viscount Chelsea, Cadogan served as a
Major
in the
Royal Westminster Militia
from 1865 to 1872; he was later
Honorary Colonel
of the battalion (which had become the
5th (Royal Westminster Militia) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers
) from 1886, and of the
2nd (South Middlesex) Rifle Volunteer Corps
from March 1892 to November 1902.
[6]
[7]
[4]
[8]
[9]
Political career
[
edit
]
In the
1868 general election
, he stood unsuccessfully as parliamentary candidate for
Bury, Lancashire
but was successfully returned as Member of Parliament for
Bath
in a by-election in May 1873, just before he was ennobled on the death of his father on 8 June and had to move to the House of Lords. He was made Under-Secretary for War in 1875 and Under-Secretary to the Colonies in 1878 by
Disraeli
.
[10]
He served under Lord Salisbury as
Lord Privy Seal
from 1886 to 1892 (after 1887 in the Cabinet), and again in the cabinet as
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
from 1895 to 1902.
[11]
In the latter office, he supported the
Land Act of 1896
which enabled Irish tenants to buy their homes from their landlords' estates and pressed the Treasury for more liberal terms than initially intended, appointed commissions to investigate intermediate education (1899) and university education (1901), and sponsored the Act of 1899 that created a department of agriculture, industries and technical education for Ireland.
[12]
He was first Mayor of Chelsea in 1900 and a
Justice of the Peace
for the counties of
Middlesex
,
Cambridgeshire
,
Norfolk
,
Suffolk
and
London
.
[7]
Philanthropy
[
edit
]
By 1888, at the initiative of the Fifth Earl, building work was well underway at the south-eastern end of London's Sloane Street to rebuild
Holy Trinity Church
to the design of the leading Arts and Crafts architect
John Dando Sedding
. Cadogan funded the entire initial operation, including the commissioning of numerous fittings for the new building by leading sculptors and designers including
Henry Wilson
(who assumed overall artistic control when Sedding died prematurely),
Onslow Ford
,
Edward Burne-Jones
,
William Morris
,
Nelson Dawson
and
Henry Hugh Armstead
. Money was found for the installation of a great organ by
James John Walker
, which quickly became famous for its cathedral-like effect in the opulent acoustic of the building. The church (and its fittings, including the organ) remain a testament to a very particularly focused example of aristocratic patronage.
As Lord of the Manor of Chelsea, he held large estates there, much of which he dedicated to houses for the working class.
During his lifetime Lord Cadogan commissioned a
mausoleum
for family interments at
Brookwood Cemetery
but in 1910 he decided he no longer wanted to be interred in the mausoleum. This building, the largest mausoleum in the cemetery, was bought by the cemetery owners, the
London Necropolis Company
, fitted with shelves and niches to hold urns, and used as a dedicated
columbarium
from then on.
[13]

The
National Arts Centre
(NAC) (
French
:
Centre national des Arts
) is a Canadian
centre for the performing arts
located in
Ottawa
,
Ontario
, along the
Rideau Canal
. It is operated by the eponymous performing arts organisation
National Arts Centre
. The National Arts Centre was designated a
National Historic Site of Canada
in 2006.
[1]
[2]
History
[
edit
]
In 1928, the National Capital Commission expropriated and demolished the Russell Theatre to make way for
Confederation Square
, leaving Ottawa without a major performing arts venue. Performers and orchestras visiting the capital were required to use the stage of the
Capitol Cinema
, which had been designed for vaudeville and films. In 1963, G. Hamilton Southam
[3]
and Levi Pettler founded the National Capital Arts Alliance with the goal of creating a suitable venue. They successfully convinced the city and government to build the new centre
downtown
on
Elgin Street
and the
Rideau Canal
.
The NAC was one of a number of projects launched by the government of
Lester B. Pearson
to commemorate Canada's
1967 centenary
. It opened its doors to the public for the first time on 31 May 1969, at a cost of
C$
46 million.
[4]
The site at one time was home to
Ottawa City Hall
, and the city donated the land to the federal government. In June 2010,
Queen Elizabeth II
unveiled a life-size bronze
statue of the Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson
outside the NAC during her royal tour of Canada.

The building, designed by Fred Lebensold, is in the
Brutalist
style and is based on the shape of a triangle and hexagon. The building is constructed of reinforced concrete. The exterior and many interior walls are faced with precast concrete panels containing exposed aggregate of crushed brown Laurentian granite.
[2]
The centre rises from a base that sits on a 950-space underground parking garage. The base houses offices, lobbies, dressing rooms, workshops and a restaurant. The site slopes from Elgin Street to the
Rideau Canal
allowing for a second underground level overlooking the canal. The roof of the base forms a multi-level terrace containing gardens that are open to the public and connects to the
Mackenzie King Bridge
. The three main performance spaces rise from the base as a series of hexagonal structures also faced with brown precast panels in a variety of textures. Windows are tall, narrow slits framed by vertical ribs. The hexagonal theme flows through the interior and appears in ceilings, light fixtures and flooring. Lobbies and stairwells house several major pieces of visual art.
Plans for the centre included an organ in Southam Hall; however, funding did not permit this. On 17 March 1970, the 25th anniversary of the liberation of the
Netherlands
, a Dutch-Canadian Committee presented two organs purchased as the result of its
Operation Thankyou Canada
. The 21-stop concert organ and
positiv organ
were both constructed by the
Flentrop Orgelbouw of Zaandam
and given in gratitude for the role played by Canadian troops in the
liberation of the Netherlands
. The concert organ premiered in a recital 7 October 1973 by Albert de Klerk.
[6]
In 2000, the NAC was named by the
Royal Architectural Institute of Canada
as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium.
[7]
In 2014,
Heritage Minister
Shelly Glover
and
Foreign Affairs Minister
John Baird
announced a $110 million
facelift
of the NAC. At construction, the centre was oriented toward a planned lagoon on the east, which was never constructed. The work would expand meeting and event facilities, install entrances and windows to reorient the focus toward Parliament Hill, and upgrade washroom facilities.
[8]
The renovated centre opened 1 July 2017 for
Canada's 150th Anniversary
.

The
Department of Computer Science
is a
department
of the
Technische Universität Darmstadt
. With a total of 36 professorships and about 3,700 students in 12 study courses, the Department of Computer Science is the largest department of the university. The department shapes the two research profile areas "Cybersecurity (CYSEC)" and "Internet and Digitization (InDi)" of the university.
Like the history of the university, the history of the department is shaped by pioneers. The beginnings of
computer science
,
artificial intelligence
and
business informatics
in
Germany
go back to the department.
History
[
edit

Beginnings of computer science in Germany
[
edit
]
Staff of the Institute for Practical Mathematics (1960)
In 1928,
Alwin Walther
was appointed professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. Walther established the Institute for Practical Mathematics (IPM) there, which was part of the Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In Germany, the beginnings of computer science go back to this institute. The institute was concerned with automating computing using mechanical and electromechanical devices and developing machines that could be used to solve mathematical problems. One of the earliest results was the System Darmstadt
slide rule
, which was widely used in mechanical engineering. Another development was an electromechanical integration system. After the
Second World War
, the institute concentrated increasingly on the development of electronic computer systems. Due to the reputation that TH Darmstadt had at that time in automatic computation research, the first congress on the subject of computer science (electronic calculators and information processing) held in German-speaking countries with international participation took place at TH Darmstadt in October 1955. The Darmstadt Electronic Calculator (DERA), which was completed in 1959, was created with the help of the
German Research Foundation
(DFG). At that time, the computer capacity was unique in Europe. Two decades before the invention of programming languages, algorithms were tested on the computing station and successfully used to process problems from industry. In 1956, the first students at DERA were able to deal with the problems of automatic calculating machines. At the same time, the first programming lectures and practical courses were offered at TH Darmstadt. In 1957, Walther made sure that TH Darmstadt got an
IBM 650
, which was the most powerful computer at that time. Thus TH Darmstadt was also the first university in Germany with a mainframe computer. In 1961, in response to Walther's efforts, the German Computer Center (DRZ) was founded in Darmstadt, the first mainframe computer center in Germany with which TH Darmstadt entered into a cooperation to train mathematical-technical assistants.
[1]
[2]
Electrical engineering
also had a major influence on computer science at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt). In 1964,
Robert Piloty
was appointed to the chair of data technology at TH Darmstadt. In the 1960s, Germany lacked competitiveness in the field of data processing. To counteract this, the Federal Committee for Scientific Research adopted a programme for the promotion of research and development in the field of data processing for public tasks on 26 April 1967. The advisory board, which consisted mainly of representatives of universities and non-university research institutions, was responsible for the implementation of the programme. At the seventh meeting of the advisory board on 15 November 1967, Karl Ganzhorn, who at the time was responsible for research and development at IBM Germany, signalled the problems of industry in finding skilled personnel. The director of the Institute for Information Processing at TH Darmstadt, Piloty, pointed out that the German universities were responsible for training qualified personnel. As a result, a committee was formed, which was chaired by Piloty. The committee formulated recommendations for the training of computer scientists, which provided for the establishment of a course of studies in computer science at several universities and technical colleges. At TH Darmstadt Piloty worked with
Winfried Oppelt
on a study plan "Computer Science", which was characterized by engineering science. There was already another curriculum with the name "Diplom-Ingenieur Informatik (Mathematik)", which came from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and provided for a stronger emphasis on software engineering. However, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering was the driving force, which is why in the same year the first computer science course of study in Germany was established at the
Faculty of Electrical Engineering
on the basis of Pilotys and Oppelts study regulations.
[1]
The first diploma thesis was written in 1971, the first doctoral thesis in 1975 and the first habilitation in 1978.
[2]
In the spring of 1969, Hartmut Wedekind and Robert Piloty had travelled through the USA together for several weeks to study the faculties of computer science there. On 7 July 1969, the Founding Committee for Computer Science (GAI) was established to constitute the Department of Computer Science. Later, the committee was replaced by a provisional department conference. This conference met for the first time on 15 May 1972, so that on that day the Department of Computer Science was officially established. Wedekind became its first dean. Piloty was awarded the
Konrad Zuse Medal
for his achievements in 1989.
[1]

Software AG logo
In 1969, graduates of TH Darmstadt founded
Software AG
. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in Europe. One of the founders was
Peter Schnell
, who was chairman of Software AG for many years and today, with his Software AG Foundation, is one of the largest donors in Germany.
[3]
Business Informatics
[
edit
]
The history of
business informatics
goes back to Peter Mertens, who studied
industrial engineering
at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt). His habilitation thesis was the first habilitation thesis on business informatics in the German-speaking world. In 1968, Peter Mertens was appointed to the first chair in the German-speaking countries focusing on economic data processing at the
Johannes Kepler University Linz
. In the same year, Hartmut Wedekind, former systems consultant at
IBM
Germany, represented the Chair of Business Administration at TH Darmstadt for the first time. Two years later, he was appointed to the Chair of Business Administration and Data Processing at TH Darmstadt. Wedekind worked on database systems and their operational applications and, as early as 1971, headed the "Data Management Systems I" research group, which dealt with databases in the operational context. It was the first larger research group to deal with the topics of business informatics. In 1976, TH Darmstadt introduced the first course of studies in business informatics in Germany.
[1]
[2]
Artificial Intelligence
[
edit
]
Wolfgang Bibel (2006)
The history of artificial intelligence goes hand in hand with the appointment of
Wolfgang Bibel
, who had been rejected by professors at the
Technical University of Munich
because they did not believe in the future of artificial intelligence. In the winter semester 1985/1986 Bible represented the chair at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt) as deputy professor for the first time, to which the university later appointed him.
Hans-Jürgen Hoffmann
, Professor for Programming Languages and Translators, was involved in the deputy professorship. He accepted the call to TH Darmstadt on 1 October 1988 and became Professor of Intellectics at the Department of Computer Science. Bible is one of the founders of artificial intelligence in Germany and Europe. He built up the necessary institutions, conferences and scientific journals and provided the necessary research programmes to establish the field of artificial intelligence. For the academic year 1991/1992 he took over the office as Dean of the Department of Computer Science of TH Darmstadt. During this time he chaired three appointment commissions. Among them were
Oskar von Stryk
and
Karsten Weihe
. In his time, he also built up his research group and made the Technische Universität Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt) one of the leading universities for artificial intelligence worldwide. The most outstanding scientific project was the National Priority Program Deduction, funded by the
German Research Foundation
(DFG). The project led to Germany assuming a leading position in artificial intelligence. He has been professor emeritus since 2004. He gave his farewell lecture on 13 February 2004.
[4]
By 2017, twenty-five of his doctoral students or staff had become professors, so that the majority of today's German AI researchers are graduates of TU Darmstadt. For his achievements he was honored by the
Gesellschaft für Informatik
as one of the ten influential minds in German AI history. He was also one of the first Fellows of the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
(AAAI).
[5]
[6]
[7]
The
Centre for Cognitive Science
(CCS) was founded at TU Darmstadt by
Constantin Rothkopf
, Professor of Psychology of Information Processing. Rothkopf became its founding director. Research groups from various disciplines work at the Centre.
[8]
At the same time
Kristian Kersting
, Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, founded the initiative Artificial Intelligence at TU Darmstadt (AI•DA), a unique model that coordinates different research groups to advance the development of artificial intelligence. Kersting was awarded in 2019 for his scientific achievements as a Fellow of the
European Association for Artificial Intelligence
(EurAI) and as a Fellow of the
European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems
(ELLIS).
[9]
[10]
In 2019, the TU Darmstadt was selected as a founding location of ELLIS with the aim of establishing a top AI research institute. The decision, made by international scientists, was based on the scientific excellence in the field.
[11]
IT Security
[
edit
]
Johannes Buchmann (2016)
In 1996,
Johannes Buchmann
was appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Computer Science. The appointment is regarded as the birth of IT security at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (TH Darmstadt). Three years later, Darmstadts universities and research institutions founded the Competence Center for Applied Security Technology (CAST), the largest network for cyber security in the German-speaking world. It was initially a forum, which was transformed into an independent association in 2003. The second professorship for IT security followed in 2001. Claudia Eckert, who also headed Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT) from 2001 to 2011, was appointed Professor of Information Security at the Technische Universität Darmstadt. The professorship was endowed by the Horst Görtz Foundation.
[12]
IT security was institutionalized in 2002 with the founding of the Darmstadt Center for IT Security (DZI), which became the
Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt
(CASED) in 2008. Buchmann and Eckert were in charge of the project. Buchmann was the founding director of CASED. In 2010,
Michael Waidner
became director of Fraunhofer SIT. The
European Center for Security and Privacy by Design
(EC SPRIDE) was founded in 2011 as a result of the efforts of Buchmann and Waidner. CASED and EC SPRIDE were part of LOEWE, the research excellence program of the state of Hesse.
In 2012,
Intel
established the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Secure Computing at the Technische Universität Darmstadt. It was the first collaborative research institute for IT security that Intel established outside the
United States
.
[13]
Two years later, the German Research Foundation (DFG) established the
Collaborative Research Centre
"CROSSING - Cryptography-Based Security Solutions" at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, which deals with cryptography-based security solutions. The first speaker of CROSSING was Buchmann.
[14]
In 2015, CASED and EC SPRIDE merged to form today's
Center for Research in Security and Privacy
(CRISP), the largest research institution for IT security in Europe.
[15]
[16]
In the same year, the German Research Foundation established the Graduate School for Privacy and Trust for Mobile Users on the initiative of
Max Mühlhäuser
. One year later, the
Federal Ministry of Finance
decided to make the Darmstadt region an outstanding location for the digital transformation of the economy. The Federal Ministry of Finance has established the centers "Digital Hub Cybersecurity" and "Digital Hub FinTech" in the region, which are to serve the networking of companies, research institutions and start-ups. CRISP was upgraded to the National Research Center for Applied Cyber Security on 1 January 2019.
[17]
[18]
Johannes Buchmann and his team founded the field of
post-quantum cryptography
internationally. In a worldwide competition organized by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology
, the XMSS signature method developed by Buchmann and his team became the first international standard for post-quantum cryptography in 2018. XMSS is the first future-proof and practical signature procedure with minimal security requirements. Buchmann was awarded the
Konrad Zuse Medal
in 2017 for his achievements.
[19]
[20]
[21]
Fraunhofer Institute in Darmstadt
[
edit
]
The history of the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT) dates back to 1961, when the German Computer Center (DRZ) was founded in Darmstadt on the initiative of
Alwin Walther
. At that time, the German Data Center was equipped with one of the most powerful mainframe computers in Germany, making it the first mainframe data center in Germany. Particularly of the DRZ was that it could be used by universities and scientific mechanisms for research purposes. As the
ARPANET
became more and more widespread, communication between the machines became the focus of research at the DRZ. In 1973, the DRZ merged with other research institutions in this field to form the
Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung (GMD)
. The Society founded the Institute for Remote Data Transmission, which was renamed the Institute for Telecooperation Technology in 1992. Under the direction of Heinz Thielmann, the Institute increasingly dealt with IT security issues and with the advent of the Internet, IT security became increasingly important, so that in 1998 it was renamed the Institute for Secure Telecooperation. In 2001 the GMD merged with the
Fraunhofer Society
. In 2004, the Institute for Secure Telecooperation became the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT). The founding director was
Claudia Eckert
, who was also Professor for Information Security at the Technische Universität Darmstadt.
[22]
Graphical Data Processing
[
edit
]
José Luis Encarnaçāo (2014)
In 1975,
José Luis Encarnação
founded the Research Group Graphic Interactive Systems (GRIS) at the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. In 1977 he and his research group introduced the
Graphical Kernel System
(GKS) as the first ISO standard for computer graphics (ISO/IEC 7942). GKS allows graphics applications to run device-independently. Images can be created and manipulated and the images were portable for the first time. In 1984 Encarnação founded the Center for Computer Graphics in Darmstadt. A working group resulting from this cooperation was taken over by the
Fraunhofer Society
and the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research (Fraunhofer IGD) was founded in 1987. The founding director of the Fraunhofer IGD was José Luis Encarnação. The institute was one of the first research institutes to deal with internet technologies. José Luis Encarnação was awarded the
Konrad Zuse Medal
for his achievements in 1997.

The search and rescue robot Hector (Heterogeneous Cooperating Team Of Robots) of the Technische Universität Darmstadt competed in 2014 in the category "Rescue Robot" in the
RoboCup
, the oldest and world's largest competition for intelligent robots in various application scenarios, and took first place there.
[29]
In 2017, the Argonaut robot, developed by a team led by
Oskar von Stryk
, won the
ARGOS Challenge
for intelligent inspection robots on oil and gas platforms, which the company
Total S.A.
had launched. The prize was half a million euros. Argonaut is a variant of
Taurob tracker
and the first fully autonomous, mobile inspection robot for oil and gas plants.
[30]
[31]
In 2018, Hector competed at the
World Robot Summit
in Tokyo in the category "Plant Disaster Prevention Challenge" and won 1st place.

Locations of the circuits that hosted or are scheduled to host a Grand Prix. Nations on the current year's schedule are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked in black. Former host nations are shown in dark grey. Former host circuits are marked with a white dot.
De facto
status of territories is shown.
Formula One
, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of
open-wheeled
auto racing
defined by the
Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile
(FIA), motorsport's world governing body.
[1]
The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform.
[2]
The
Formula One World Championship season
consists of a series of races, known as
Grands Prix
, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on
closed city streets
.
[3]
The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (
World Drivers' Championship
), and one for constructors (
World Constructors' Championship
).
[4]
This list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms "Formula One race" and "World Championship race" were not always synonymous throughout history - see
Formula One § Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races
for a detailed explanation.

The first World Championship Grand Prix was held in
1950
at
Silverstone
; since then  76 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history:
Nürburgring
,
Spa-Francorchamps
,
Monza
, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.
[5]
Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in
2012
, nearly half were not on the calendar before
1999
.
[6]
The
Autodromo Nazionale Monza
has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in
1980
, when the
Italian Grand Prix
was held at the
Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari
.
[7]
The
Miami International Autodrome
became the 76th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the
Miami Grand Prix
in 2022; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the
Pescara Circuit
, which hosted the
1957 Pescara Grand Prix
: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in
Pescara
, Italy, held the annual
Coppa Acerbo
race, and in
1957
it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which
Stirling Moss
won.
[8]
The
Las Vegas Strip Circuit
is due to host its first Grand Prix in 2023, with the
Las Vegas Grand Prix
.
[9]
As some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.

The
1931 Stanford football team
represented
Stanford University
in the
1931 college football season
. Their head coach was
Pop Warner
in his eighth season. The team played its home games at
Stanford Stadium
in
Stanford, California
. This was the first year the team was officially known as the "Indians." The team had been referred to by that nickname for some time, but the mascot was officially adopted by a unanimous vote by the Executive Committee for the Associated Students at the end of the previous football season.

Stanford's end-of-season game against Dartmouth at
Harvard Stadium
remains the only time the team played in that stadium; a planned game at Harvard in 1950 was canceled.

The Battle of the Harvests
(aka
Battle of the Harvests
) is an 18-minute 1942 Canadian
documentary film
, made by the
National Film Board of Canada
(NFB) as part of the
wartime
Canada Carries On
series. The film was produced by
James Beveridge
and directed by
Stanley Jackson
, who also provided the narration.
[1]
The Battle of the Harvests
shows how the farmers were mobilized worldwide in a battle of harvests to serve the fighting nations during the
Second World War
. The film's
French
version title was
La Bataille des récoltes
.
Synopsis
[
edit
]
In 1942, farmers have become an important part of the
war effort
on the North American
home front
. The prairie farmlands in Canada are the world's richest and provide the food for the
Allied
nations. Food production was aided by favourable weather and introduction of scientific innovations and methods such as irrigation, terraced fields and planned forms. Canada has also embarked on a program of rationing and conservation to ensure food is available for all its wartime needs.
In the United Kingdom, agriculture has undergone a great transformation. In 20 months, English farmers have repaired the damage suffered over 20 years through the use of machinery, new farming methods and the reclamation of two billion acres of farmland from pastures and parks making the difference. The subsequent increase in annual grain production rose from prewar levels of 100 tons to 170 tons. To help meet the nation's food needs, over five million English households have also planted their own gardens. The critical need for farm workers has led to ordinary civilians joining with soldiers to bring in the harvest.
In the war-torn
Soviet Union
,
collectivization
has harnessed the potential of its farm "factories" to fulfill the needs of its people. From the wheat fields of the
Caucasus
, harvests have been able to provide for its far-flung millions. Collectivization has brought an integration of its food resources, creating a powerful agricultural sector that rivals its industrial might.
Food has been of primary concern to Canada, as at the heart of many of the government's wartime food policies was the need to feed Canada's soldiers and overseas Allies. Instead of the scarcity and shortages that people faced in the 1930s, the knowledge that a nutritious diet was necessary for a fighting man meant that a healthy, hard-working populace would result. Agricultural products have also become the raw elements of new products from flax fibre used for parachute cords, dandelions and milkweed crushed to become
synthetic rubber
and sunflower seed made into oil.
Food represents half the weight of products that are being shipped across the world. Canada, alone, provided five million tons of wheat, while the United States joined with Canada to provide other food stuffs. Previously occupied by the
Axis powers
, Algiers and Morocco received the first emergency supplies of food, shipped alongside weapons. When the Allied forces are finally able to further liberate the conquered peoples of Europe and Asia, providing an adequate supply of food will be one of the first priorities.
In Canada, the devastating
Depression
years has shown the notion that food was only a money-making commodity, has been countered by understanding that agriculture is a vital sector in the home front. The
erosion
of the
Great Plains
had caused great
ecological
and economic damage that took years of proper cultivation, new irrigation programs and careful government planning to undo. Farmers and ranchers began to become more involved in their welfare with progressive organizations formed to best use the land.
As industrial production in Canada ramped up, the inevitable shortages in agricultural labour has been met by a variety of new workers, from women to youth and even American farmers from the deep south who have already completed their harvests, coming north to help bring in a later harvest. The joint effort of Canadians from every walk of life who have come to understand that food is our "weapon of war", have brought in the largest harvest in Canada's history, twice as large as the year previous.

Production
[

Typical of the NFB's
Canada Carries On
series of documentary
short films
,
The Battle of the Harvests
was a morale-boosting
propaganda film
made in cooperation with the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.
[2]
Using newsreel material, the film was a
compilation documentary
, edited to provide a coherent story, and narrated by its director, Stanley Jackson.
[3]
Stanley Jackson alternated with stage actor
Lorne Greene
, known for his work on both radio broadcasts as a news announcer at
CBC
, as the main narrators of the
Canada Carries On
series. Jackson's voice was "mellifluous" and sounded scholarly, while Greene's voice was more dramatic.
[4]
Jackson was considered the "house" narrator at the NFB, setting the standard for other NFB directors later to take on the role of narrating their own films.
[5]
[Note 1]
Reception
[
edit
]
As part of the
Canada Carries On
series,
The Battle of the Harvests
was produced in 35 mm for the theatrical market.
[7]
Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with
Famous Players theatres
to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, with further distribution by
Columbia Pictures
.
[8]
After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.

Lower Fox Creek School
, is a one-room schoolhouse that is part of the
Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve
near
Strong City, Kansas
, United States.
Constructed in 1882, and used for classes from 1884 to 1930, the 24 foot by 30 foot stone building with cypress woodwork and pine flooring is located on a site provided by rancher Steve F. Jones.
[1]
[2]
Stonemason David Rettiger constructed the building using limestone from the nearby Barney Lantry quarries.
[2]
In 1946-1947 the school district dissolved and the property deed reverted to the ranch owner.
[2]
The building was used as housing for the ranch and later hay storage.
[3]
In 1968, local garden clubs sought permission from ranch owners, the Davis-Noland-Merrill Grain Company, to restore the building.
[3]
After several years of restoration work, the building was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
on September 6, 1974.
[4]
In 1994, the property was purchased by the National Park Trust and on September 20, 2002, ownership of the schoolhouse and surrounding site was transferred to the National Park Service.

Dahui Zonggao
(1089-10 August 1163) (
Chinese
:
大慧宗杲
; Wade-Giles: Ta-hui Tsung-kao; Japanese: Daie Sōkō; Vietnamese: Đại Huệ Tông Cảo) was a 12th-century
Chinese
Chan
(Zen) master. Dahui was a student of
Yuanwu Keqin
(Wade-Giles: Yuan-wu K'o-ch'in; Japanese: Engo Kokugon) (1063-1135) and was the 12th generation of the
Linji school
of Chan Buddhism. He was the dominant figure of the
Linji school
during the
Song dynasty
.
[1]
Dahui introduced the practice of
kan huatou
, or "inspecting the critical phrase," of a
kōan
story. This method was called the "Chan of gongan (kōan) introspection" (Kanhua Chan).
[2]
Dahui was a vigorous critic of what he called the "heretical Chan of
silent illumination
" (mozhao xie Chan) of the
Caodong school
(Wade-Giles: Ts'ao-tung; Japanese:
Sōtō
).
Biography
[
edit
]
Early years
[
edit
]
Dahui was born in
Xuancheng
,
Anhui
, to the Xi family. He left home at sixteen and became a Buddhist monk at seventeen. His initiatory name was Zong Gao. Following the tradition of the day, he wandered from Chan community to community, seeking instruction. He studied under a Caodong master and mastered the essentials of the
Five Ranks
in two years. He studied all the records of the
Five Houses of Chan
, being particularly drawn to the words of
Yunmen Wenyan
(Wade-Giles: Yün-men Wên-yen Japanese: Ummon Bun’en), 864-949, founder of one of the "Five Houses" of Chan. He sought out instruction on the sayings of the old masters collected and commented on by
Xuedou Chongxian
(Wade-Giles: Hsüeh-tou Ch’ung-hsien; Japanese: Setchō Jūken) which became the basis for the koan collection, the
Blue Cliff Record
.
Tangzhou
[
edit
]
Dissatisfied with intellectual study, at the age of twenty-one he went to
Treasure Peak
, near the modern city of Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, to study with
Zhan Tangzhun
(Wade-Giles: Chan-t'ang Wen-chun), a master of the
Huang-lung
branch of the Linji School. Although Dahui developed a great intellectual understanding of Chan, enlightenment eluded him. Recognizing his potential and great intellectual abilities, Zhan Tangzhun made Dahui his personal attendant. One day Tangzhou asked Dahui,
"Why are your nostrils boundless today?"
Dahui replied, "(Because) I’m at your place."
Tangzhou retorted, "You phony Chan man."
[3]
Another time, when Dahui was twenty-six, Tangzhou called him over and said,
You can talk about Ch'an very well; you can quote the sayings of former masters and write commentaries on them. You are eloquent in giving sermons and quick with the exchanges during interviews. But there is one thing which you still do not know".
Ta-hui asked what it was.
Tangzhou answered, "What you do not have is the awakening. Thus, when I talk with you in my room, you have Chan. But as soon as you leave the room, you lose it. When you are awake and attentive, you have Chan. But as soon as you fall asleep, you lose it. If you continue like this, how can you ever conquer life and death?"
Dahui agreed, saying, "This is precisely my point of doubt."
[4]
Yuanwu
[
edit
]
Dahui continued his studies with
Yuanwu Keqin
. On his way to Tianning Wanshou, a monastery in the old imperial city of Bian (modern
Kaifeng
), Dahui vowed to work with Yuanwu for nine years and if he did not achieve enlightenment, or, if Yuanwu turned out to be a false teacher, giving approval too easily, Dahui would give up and turn to writing scriptures or treatises.
Yuanwu gave Dahui Yunmen’s saying, "East Mountain walks on the water" as a koan to work through. Dahui threw himself into the koan and struggled with it day and night, giving forty-nine answers to the koan, but all were rejected by his teacher. Finally, on May 13, 1125, he broke through. Later, he recalled the event:
Master Yuan-wu ascended the high seat in the lecture hall at the request of Madame Chang K'ang-kuo (張康國夫人). He said, "Once a monk asked Yun-men this question, 'where do all the
Buddhas
come from?' Yun-men answered. 'The East Mountain walks over the water' (Tung-shan shuei sheng hsing). But if I were he, I would have given a different answer. 'Where do all the Buddhas come from?' 'As the fragrant breeze comes from the south, a slight coolness naturally stirs in the palace pavilion.'" When I heard this, all of a sudden there was no more before and after. Time stopped. I ceased to feel any disturbance in my mind, and remained in a state of utter calmness.
[5]
As it turned out, Yuanwu did not give approval too easily. He said,
It is indeed not easy to arrive at your present state of mind. But unfortunately, you have only died but are not yet reborn. Your greatest problem is that you do not doubt words enough. Don't you remember this saying? 'When you let go your hold on the precipice, you become the master of your own fate; to die and afterward come to life again, no one can then deceive you.
[6]
Yuanwu gave Dahui the koan, "To be and not to be - it is like a
wisteria
leaning on a tree" to work on and after six months, Dahui achieved the final breakthrough and was recognized by Yuanwu as a
Dharma
-heir in the Linji tradition.
Teaching career
[
edit
]
Yuanwu assigned teaching duties to Dahui and Dahui’s fame spread far and wide. A high ranking government official, the
Minister of the Right
, Lu Shun, gave Dahui a purple robe and the honorific, "Fori", the Sun of the Dharma. The following year, 1126, the
Jürchen Jin dynasty
captured the
Emperors Huizong
and
Qinzong
; the capital was moved to the south and the Southern Song era began.
Dahui also moved south and taught both monks and laymen. It was at this time that he began his severe criticism of the "heretical Chan of silent illumination" of the Caodong school which he would continue for the rest of his life. He became a great favorite of the educated and literate classes as well as Chan monks and in 1137, at the age of forty-nine,
Chancellor Zhang Jun
(
張浚
), a student of Dahui, appointed him abbot of Jingshan monastery in the new capital Lin-an (modern
Hangzhou
,
Zhejiang
). Within a few years his
sangha
grew to two thousand and among his lay followers were many high-ranking officials. Dahui became the acknowledged leader of Buddhism of the Southern Song dynasty.
[7]
Exile and return
[
edit
]
A letter written by Dahui to a friend during his exile
However, disaster was about to befall him. Because of his association with a high official who fell out of favor with the prime minister, all Dahui’s imperial honors and his ordination certificate were stripped from him and he was sent in exile to Hengzhou (
Hunan
) in the year 1141. At the age of sixty-two he was transferred to present day
Guangdong
, a place notorious in those days for plagues and hostile elements. Some fifty of Dahui’s monks died there in a plague.
[8]
Throughout these difficult years, Dahui continued teaching in the Linji tradition of Chan Buddhism, attracting both gentry and commoners. Finally, in 1155, Dahui was pardoned and was allowed to return to his former monastery at Jingshan where he continued his teaching until he died five years later on 10 August 1163. He wrote a final verse for his disciples, saying, "Without a verse, I couldn’t die."
Birth is thus
Death is thus
Verse or no verse
What’s the fuss?
[9]
Emperor Xiaozong of Song
bestowed upon him the posthumous title "Chan Master of Great Wisdom," from which the name Dahui derives.
[9]
Teachings
[
edit
]
The enlightenment experience as the answer to the riddle of life and death, and the great doubt necessary to have the determination to break through, became central to Dahui’s teaching.
Kanhua chan
[
edit
]
Dahui’s letters to lay people reveal a compassionate teacher, who believed that the enlightenment promised by the Buddha was available to all people, regardless of their daily activities. The best way to achieve this was through the use of gong-ans as a daily meditation device.
Gong-ans
[
edit
]
Main article:
Koan
Gong-ans developed during the
Tang Dynasty
(618-907)
[10]
from the recorded sayings collections of Chán-masters, which quoted many stories of "a famous past Chán figure's encounter with disciples or other interlocutors and then offering his own comment on it".
[11]
Those stories and the accompanying comments were used to educate students, and broaden their insight into the Buddhist teachings.
Those stories came to be known as gongan, "public cases".
[11]
Such a story was only considered a gongan when it was commented upon by another Chán-master.
[11]
This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters confirmed the master's position as awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past.
[12]
Dahui saw this practice of commenting on gongans in his time as becoming a superficial literary study. In a radical move to counter this literary emphasis, he even ordered the suppression of his own teacher’s masterly collection of koans, The
Blue Cliff Record
(Wade-Giles: Pi Yen Lu; Pinyin: Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku), burning all copies and the wooden blocks to print them, effectively taking the venerated text out of circulation for the next two centuries.
[13]
Hua tou practice
[
edit
]
Main article:
Hua Tou
Dahui introduced the use of
k'an-hua
, the concentration on the
hua tou
("word head") of a
gong-an
to attain
insight
.
[14]
[15]
[16]
Until his time, the developing gongan-tradition consisted mainly of commenting on "old cases", adding comments and poetry. This use of written comments and poetry shows the influence of Chinese literati culture, to which both state officials and most Buddhist higher clergy belonged.
[14]
[17]
[16]
Although there were hundreds of koans available, Dahui used only a few, believing that deep penetration of one or two koans would be enough to attain enlightenment. To achieve this, one had to work assiduously and with great determination, like someone whose "head is on fire".
[18]
It mattered little to Dahui whether a person was particularly intelligent or not - liberation was available to all. He wrote:
It doesn’t matter whether your rational understanding is sharp or dull; it has nothing to do with matters of sharpness or dullness, nor does it have anything to do with quiet or confusion.
[19]
Dahui often used the famous
mu-koan
, "A monk asked
Zhàozhōu
, ‘Does a dog have Buddha-nature?’ Zhàozhōu replied, ‘No’ (Chinese: Wu; Japanese:
Mu
) (which later became the 18th koan in the collection
The Book of Equanimity
published 61 years after his death in 1224 and then appearing again as the first koan in
The Gateless Gate
published 4 years later in 1228). Dahui taught that
This one word ‘no’ is a knife to sunder the doubting mind of birth and death. The handle of this knife is in one’s own hand alone: you can’t have anyone else wield it for you…You consent to take hold of it yourself only if you can abandon your life. If you cannot abandon your life, just keep to where your doubt remains unbroken for a while: suddenly you’ll consent to abandon your life, and then you’ll be done.
[20]
Doubt
[
edit
]
The concept of ‘doubt’ was very important in Dahui’s teaching. He warned his students that they must ‘doubt’ words to not be fooled by them. Furthermore, they needed to ‘doubt’ their very existence. He said,
Many students today do not doubt themselves, but they doubt others. And so it is said, ‘Within great doubt there necessarily exists great enlightenment.’
[21]
Influence on the Rinzai-tradition
[
edit
]
His teachings on kanhua practice became the standard for the Linji school tradition of koan practice in China, Korea and Japan. Dahui extorted a strong influence on the Japanese
Rinzai
teacher
Hakuin Ekaku
, who also taught great doubt as necessary to awaken.
Rejection of silent illumination
[
edit
]
Main article:
Shikantaza
Dahui’s teachings contain relentless attacks on the practice of
silent illumination
, sitting in meditation in tranquility and quietness. He labeled teachers of this type of meditation practice as "heretical" and complained,
They just sit in a ghostly cave on a dark mountain after their meals. They call this practice "silent illumination", "dying the great death", "the state before the birth of one's parents." They sit there until calluses appear on their bottoms, yet they still do not dare to move."
[22]
To his opinion this type of practice leads to drowsiness, blankness and intellectualization and conceptualization of Chan Buddhism rather than enlightenment. He thought that teachers who taught this method of meditation had "never awakened themselves, they don’t believe anyone has awakened."
[23]
For Dahui, koans were the only way to enlightenment and without koans, one would "be like a blind man without a walking stick: unable to take even one step."
[18]
But koans had to be penetrated fully, not intellectualized. It was this fear of superficiality and intellectualization of old koans that led him to destroy all copies of his own teacher’s masterpiece, the
Blue Cliff Record,
to save Chan and to authenticate proper koan practice.
Writings
[
edit
]
Only one work can be attributed to Dahui, a collection of koans entitled
Zhengfa Yanzang
正法眼藏
[24]
(The Storehouse of the True Dharma Eye, J.
Shobogenzo
)
[a]
Dahui also compiled the
Chánlín Bǎo Xùn
(禪林寶訓, "Treasured Teachings of the Chan Monastic Tradition"), instructions of former Chan abbots about the virtues and ideals of
monastic
life, in collaboration with another monk, Dagui. A disciple of Dahui,
Zuyong
, compiled a collection of Dahui’s life and teaching called
Dahui Bujue Chanshi Nianbu
("Chronological Biography of Chan Master Dahui"). The
Zhiyue lu
, compiled by
Qu Ruji
, also contains information on Dahui’s teachings and is the basis of the J. C. Cleary translation
Swampland Flowers,
of which the majority is a collection of letters Dahui wrote to his students.

Junius P. Rodriguez
is a professor of history at
Eureka College
in
Eureka, Illinois
, who has been the general editor of multiple major reference books on the history of
slavery in the United States
and the world, as well as related topics such as black history and abolitionism. His work on the
history of slavery
was acclaimed as "outstanding" by other scholars and by librarians, who have recommended it as part of the core collection for every academic library
[
]
and many public libraries as well.
In July 2017, Rodriguez announced his candidacy for the
U.S. House
representing
Illinois's 18th congressional district
in the
2018 U.S. federal midterm election
,
[1]
but lost to incumbent Republican
Darin LaHood
.
Career
[
edit
]
Rodriguez grew up in
Louisiana
. After earning his B.A. from
Nicholls State University
(1979), he taught in the public school system of
Lafourche Parish, Louisiana
, for nearly a decade. Rodriguez served a term as Parish Councilman in Lafourche Parish from 1979-1983.
[2]
Rodriguez earned his M.A. from
Louisiana State University
(1987), and Ph.D. from
Auburn University
(1992).
[3]
[4]
Rodriguez has been a professor of history at
Eureka College
since 1992.
[5]
John Greenfieldt and Patrice Bartell recommended his
Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion
for public library core collections.
[6]
Rodriguez consulted on the development of the documentary
Human Bondage
, which aired as part of the
History Channel
's
History's Mysteries
series in 2000.
[3]
In 2002, he helped draw national attention to the 500th anniversary of the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade. Journalist DeWayne Wickham described his efforts as "a perfect teachable moment for discussion and reflection" that was fitting for the event.
[7]
[8]
Rodriguez unsuccessfully challenged incumbent
Republican
congressman
Darin LaHood
of
Illinois's 18th congressional district
in
2016
, running as a
Democrat
. He won 27.9% of the vote to LaHood's 72.1%.
[9]
His number of votes was the second most ever earned by a Democrat in the Illinois 18th District, despite running as a vacancy appointment on a shortened campaign schedule.

Gross-Rosen
was a network of
Nazi concentration camps
built and operated by
Nazi Germany
during
World War II
. The main camp was located in the German village of Gross-Rosen, now the modern-day
Rogoźnica
in
Lower Silesian Voivodeship
, Poland;
[1]
directly on the rail-line between the towns of
Jawor
(Jauer) and
Strzegom
(Striegau).
[2]
[3]
Its prisoners were mostly
Jews
,
Poles
and
Soviet
citizens.
[1]
At its peak activity in 1944, the Gross-Rosen complex had up to 100 subcamps located in eastern Germany and in German-occupied
Czechoslovakia
and
Poland
. The population of all Gross-Rosen camps at that time accounted for 11% of the total number of inmates incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camp system.
[1]
The camp
[
edit
]
Model of the Gross-Rosen main camp from the Rogoźnica Museum
[2]
KZ Gross-Rosen was set up in the summer of 1940 as a satellite camp of the
Sachsenhausen concentration camp
from Oranienburg. Initially,
the slave labour
was carried out in a huge stone quarry owned by the
SS-Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke GmbH
(SS German Earth and Stone Works).
[3]
In the fall of 1940 the use of labour in Upper Silesia was taken over by the new
Organization Schmelt
formed on the orders of
Heinrich Himmler
. It was named after its leader
SS-Oberführer
Albrecht Schmelt. The company was put in charge of employment from the camps with Jews intended to work for food only.
The Gross-Rosen location close to occupied Poland was of considerable advantage.
[4]
Prisoners were put to work in the construction of a system of subcamps for
expellees from the annexed territories
. Gross Rosen became an independent camp on 1 May 1941. As the complex grew, the majority of inmates were put to work in the new Nazi enterprises attached to these subcamps.
[3]
In October 1941 the
SS
transferred about 3,000
Soviet POWs
to Gross-Rosen for execution by shooting. Gross-Rosen was known for its brutal treatment of the so-called
Nacht und Nebel
prisoners vanishing without a trace from targeted communities. Most died in the
granite
quarry. The brutal treatment of the political and Jewish prisoners was not only in the hands of guards and German criminal prisoners brought in by the
SS
, but to a lesser extent also fuelled by the German administration of the stone quarry responsible for starvation rations and denial of medical help. In 1942, for political prisoners, the average survival time-span was less than two months.

Due to a change of policy in August 1942, prisoners were likely to survive longer because they were needed as slave workers in German war industries. Among the companies that benefited from the slave labour of the concentration camp inmates were German electronics manufacturers such as
Blaupunkt
,
Siemens
, as well as
Krupp
,
IG Farben
, and
Daimler-Benz
, among others.
[5]
Some prisoners who were not able to work but not yet dying were sent to the
Dachau concentration camp
in so-called
invalid
transports.
The largest population of inmates, however, were
Jews
, initially from the Dachau and Sachsenhausen camps, and later from
Buchenwald
. During the camp's existence, the Jewish inmate population came mainly from Poland and
Hungary
; others were from
Belgium
,
France
,
Netherlands
,
Greece
,
Yugoslavia
,
Slovakia
, and
Italy
.
Following the unsuccessful Polish
Warsaw Uprising
of 1944, the Germans deported 3,000 Poles from the Dulag 121 camp in
Pruszków
, where they were initially imprisoned, to Gross-Rosen.
[6]
Those Poles were mainly people of 20 to 40 years of age.

Subcamps
[
edit
]
At its peak activity in 1944, the Gross-Rosen complex had up to 100
subcamps
,
[1]
located in eastern Germany and German-occupied Czechoslovakia and Poland. In its final stage, the population of the Gross-Rosen camps accounted for 11% of the total inmates in Nazi concentration camps at that time. A total of 125,000 inmates of various nationalities passed through the complex during its existence, of whom an estimated 40,000 died on site, on
death marches
and in evacuation transports. The camp was liberated on 14 February 1945 by the
Red Army
. A total of over 500 female camp guards were trained and served in the Gross-Rosen complex. Female SS staffed the women's subcamps of
Brünnlitz
, Graeben,
Gruenberg
, Gruschwitz Neusalz, Hundsfeld,
Kratzau II
, Oberaltstadt,
Reichenbach
, and Schlesiersee Schanzenbau.
The
Gabersdorf labour camp
had been part of a network of forced labor camps for Jewish prisoners that had operated under
Organization Schmelt
since 1941. The
spinning mill
where the female Jewish prisoners worked had been "
Aryanized
" in 1939 by a
Vienna
-based company called Vereinigte Textilwerke K. H. Barthel & Co. The prisoners also worked in factories operated by the companies Aloys Haase and J. A. Kluge und Etrich. By 18 March 1944 Gabersdorf had become a subcamp of Gross-Rosen.
[7]
One subcamp of Gross-Rosen was the
Brünnlitz labor camp
, situated in the
Czechoslovakian
town of
Brněnec
, where
Jews
rescued by
Oskar Schindler
were interned.
The Brieg subcamp, located near the village of
Pampitz
, had originally been the location of a Jewish forced labor camp until August 1944, when the Jewish prisoners were replaced by the first transport of prisoners from the Gross-Rosen main camp. The camp was mostly staffed by soldiers from the
Luftwaffe
and a few SS members. Most of the prisoners were Polish, with smaller numbers of Russian and Czech prisoners. Most of the Poles had been evacuated from the
Pawiak prison
in
Warsaw
; others had been arrested within the territory controlled by the
Reich
or had been transported from
Kraków
and
Radom
.
[7]
Brieg's camp kitchen was run by Czech prisoners. The three daily meals included 1 pint of
mehlzupa
(a soup made from water and
meal
),
[8]
150 grams of bread, 1 quart of soup made with
rutabaga
,
beets
,
cabbage
,
kale
or sometimes
nettles
, 1 pint of black "coffee" and a spoonful of
molasses
.  Sometimes "hard workers" called
zulaga
would be rewarded with a piece of
blood sausage
or raw
horsemeat
sausage,
jam
and
margarine
. Prisoners also received 1 cup of
Knorr
soup per week.
[7]
Camp commandants
[
edit
]
During the Gross-Rosen initial period of operation as a formal subcamp of
Sachsenhausen
, the following two
SS
Lagerführer
officers served as the camp commandants, the
SS-Untersturmführer
Anton Thumann
, and
SS-Untersturmführer
Georg Güßregen
. From May 1941 until liberation, the following officials served as commandants of a fully independent
concentration camp
at Gross-Rosen:
SS-Obersturmbannführer
Arthur Rödl
, May 1941 - September 1942
SS-Hauptsturmführer
Wilhelm Gideon
, September 1942 - October 1943
SS-Sturmbannführer
Johannes Hassebroek
, October 1943 until evacuation
War crimes trial
[
edit
]
On 12 August 1948 the trial of three Gross Rosen camp officials, Johannes Hassebroek, Helmut Eschner and Eduard Drazdauskas, began before a Soviet Military Court. On 7 October 1948 all were found guilty of war crimes. Eschner and Drazdauskas were sentenced to life imprisonment and Hassebroek was sentenced to death, but this was later commuted also to life imprisonment.

Main article:
List of subcamps of Gross-Rosen
The most far-reaching expansion of the Gross-Rosen system of labour camps took place in 1944 due to accelerated demand for support behind the advancing front. The character and purpose of new camps shifted toward defense infrastructure. In some cities, as in
Wrocław
(Breslau) camps were established in every other district. It is estimated that their total number reached 100 at that point according to list of their official destinations. The biggest sub-camps included
AL Fünfteichen
in
Jelcz-Laskowice
, four camps in Wrocław,
Dyhernfurth
in
Brzeg Dolny
,
Landeshut
in
Kamienna Góra
, and the entire
Project Riese
along the
Owl Mountains
.

This list includes those recognised
minerals
beginning with the letter
M
. The
International Mineralogical Association
is the international group that recognises new minerals and new mineral names; however, minerals discovered before 1959 did not go through the official naming procedure, although some minerals published previously have been either confirmed or discredited since that date. This list contains a mixture of mineral names that have been approved since 1959 and those mineral names believed to still refer to valid mineral species (these are called "grandfathered" species).
The list is divided into groups:

The
Armed Forces of the Liberation of Angola
(
Portuguese
:
Forças Armadas de Libertação de Angola
) or
FALA
was the armed wing of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), a prominent political faction during the
Angolan Civil War
.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
After their training in
China
in 1965, the first military cadres returned to Angola, settled in the eastern part of the country and began the mobilization and recruitment of guerrillas. In this way, the first embryonic contingent of FALA was formed.
The number of guerrillas increased with the growing number of UNITA members among the population, thus permitting effective military training. This enabled them to begin the mission of liberating the country from the claws of Portuguese colonialism, as proved by the attacks of 4 and 25 December 1966 on
Kassamba
and
Teixeira de Sousa
respectively. The first military regions were established along with their respective independent zones and operational fronts like
Quembo
, Lewa and the northern zone.
The Second Congress of UNITA was held in 1969, when a programme for FALA was laid down. This included the expansion of the guerrilla war to the central, southern and northern parts of the country and the formation of compact guerrilla contingents for all fronts, zones and military regions existing at the time. The Black Panther contingent was then formed, under the command of Major Samuimbila. The first Chief of Staff,
Samuel Piedoso Chingunji
, better known by his war name, Kapessi Kafundanga, was also appointed.
FALA became very effective, causing the enemy to suffer many defeats, expanding the guerrilla zones and consolidating the liberated areas—a force that the Portuguese colonialists could not ignore. On 14 June 1974, a ceasefire was signed with the Portuguese government.
There being little possibility of a peaceful solution to the Angolan problem, UNITA played a role as a moderator in order to avoid an armed confrontation, triggered on the one hand by the Soviet Union in support of the MPLA and on the other hand by the United States of America, supporting the
National Liberation Front of Angola
(FNLA).
The
People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA), through the
Cubans
, violated the Alvor agreement, opting for the seizure of power through the use of arms.
During the civil war, FALA abandoned the towns not only to reorganize itself, but also to oppose the minority regime of Luanda through guerrilla warfare. In May 1976, owing to the turmoil, the Conference of Cuanza was held, resulting in the Cuanza Manifesto. The latter laid down a programme for FALA for the remobilization of the soldiers and cadres, which at that stage were traumatized by the aggressive Soviet war machine.
Territorial organization of the army that included fronts and independent military regions now took place. The first politico-military cadres--among them that of Major Jose´ Jeremias Bandua who died in Cunene--were trained.
Compact guerrilla units were formed: Venceremos, Estamos a Voltar (MR1), Dragões da morte (MR3) and Faísca negra (MR85).
By 1977, people were joining UNITA in large numbers and, consequently, the number of guerrillas increased considerably.
In March of the same year, at Benda in the
Huambo
Province, the movement’s Fourth Congress was held and outlined further objectives for FALA, such as the formation of the first trained, equipped and motivated battalions, among which the battalions of Sam Nujomo and Kazambuela stood out.
The disciplinary code of the FALA was also established. The military regions were restructured and the guerrilla regions expanded. Training camps were established in the same year on all fronts as well as in the politico-military cadres in Military Region 11. Territorial divisions were also designated, thus forming northern, eastern and western fronts.
In 1979, the first semi-regular battalions were formed, such as Samuimbila, Siule Siule and 333.
In 1980, the expansion of semi-regular battalions gave new vigour to the armed struggle, leading to the defeat of new territories and the consolidation of those that had already been conquered. More specialists in anti-aircraft artillery, engineering, intelligence, special commandos, communications, logistics and medical care were trained. In 1981 the first brigades such as the 12th, 21st, 53rd, 34th and 45th were formed and other battalions were maintained as independent units.
In 1982 the Fifth Congress was held, which drew up a new strategy for FALA, including the formation of military columns and compact guerrilla units at the level of all politico-military fronts.

United States Army
base and the largest, most expensive American foreign military base in
Southeast Europe
since the
Vietnam War
, was built there in 1999.

Main article:
History of Ferizaj
The town (known as Ferızovık when it was part of the
Ottoman Empire
) was little more than a village until 1873, when it became part of the
Belgrade
-
Thessaloniki
railway. Its name derives from a hotel owned before 1873 by Feriz Shasivari.
The
Goddess of Varos
, dating to the sixth millennium BC
The oldest known cultural group, in the
6th
and
5th millennia BC
in
Kosovo
, was the
Starčevo culture
. They lived near rivers and
river terraces
. Their houses were built of willows and mud, and their main occupation was agriculture.
[4]
The
Vinča culture
, who replaced the Starčevo culture around 4300 BC, also lived near rivers. The settlements were unfortified, with dense rows of willow-and-mud houses. Remnants of their culture include ceramic vessels and large numbers of baked-clay figures.
[5]
The Bubanj-Hum culture, which replaced the Vinča culture from present-day
Bulgaria
, left few artifacts.
[5]
The
Baden culture
arrived from the Danube in its southernmost expansion, ending before the end of the 3rd millennium BC.
[6]
Antiquity
[
edit
]
From the 8th century BC to the
Roman
conquest, the
Dardani
inhabited the region.
[6]
They cremated their dead and buried their remains in
tumuli
. Two necropolises have been found; one in the Kuline area near the railway station in Gërlicë, and the other in the Mollopolc region along the Ferizaj-
Štimlje
road.
[7]
Around 280 BC, the Dardani were reportedly ruled by a king.
[7]
Most surviving information on the Dardani concerns their wars against the
Macedons
. The first contact between the Dardani and the Romans was in 200 BC, when they offered military assistance against Macedonia. In 96 BC, the Roman emperor
Sulla
subdued the Dardani.
[7]
A number of
Roman
settlements were founded across the valley, on the old
lake terraces
. These settlements had a road network connecting cities such as
Ulpiana
and
Skopje
, part of the road connecting Macedonia to
Dalmatia
via Ferizaj and the gorge of
Kaçanik
. Parts of the road were discovered on the riverbed of the
Lepenac
and near the villages of Doganaj and Reka.
[7]
Middle ages
[
edit
]
The region was on a road which ran south from
Slovenia
and
Croatia
through
Sarajevo
,
Vushtrri
,
Pristina
and
Lipjan
to
Skopje
and crossed the
Shkodër
-
Prizren
road.
[8]
According to an anonymous 1559-1560 manuscript in the library of
St Mark's Basilica
in
Venice
by a traveler from
Venice
to
Istanbul
, "On July 3 set off and came to a place named Villa Negra
Crnoljeva
) ... The valley is surrounded on all sides by hills." The writer then passed Sopotnice, a village near
Kaçanik
, and reached
Skopje
on July 5.
[8]
Many artifacts have been found at
Nerodimë e Poshtme
and
Štimlje
.
[9]
According to a 1455
Turkish
census of the former
Branković dynasty
, the Ferizaj region had 646 villages. Agriculture was the basic source of income, and other occupations included blacksmiths, potters, furriers, ranchers, and priests and monks.
[10]
After the
Austrian
-
Turkish
wars of the late 17th century and the first half of the 18th century, rapid Islamization began under the
Ottoman Empire
. According to Turkish sources, "Feriz-Bey" was founded with the railway from
Skopje
to
Mitrovica
. Although it was first known as "Tasjon" by the surrounding villagers (the Turkish pronunciation of the
French
station
), the name Ferizaj derived from Feriz Shasivari.
[11]
Inns, warehouses and a market followed the railway station. Traders passed through Kosovo from
Prizren
to
Shkodër
by caravan en route to
Thessaloniki
. Cereals were exported through Ferizaj in exchange for goods from Thessaloniki and Skopje. For about 30 years, Ferizaj had about 400 houses and 200 shops, and most of its population were traders or craftsmen. Some 20th-century visitors described the city as having more stores than houses.
[12]
Undated photo of Ferizaj
The railway in 1903
When Ferizaj fell to Serbia during the
First Balkan War
, the local Albanian population offered a determined resistance and fighting reportedly lasted for three days.
[13]
The Serbian commander ordered the population to surrender. Three to four hundred men were executed
[13]
and, according to the
Archbishop of Skopje
Lazër Mjeda
, only three Muslim Albanians over age fifteen were left alive.
[14]
The destruction of Albanian-occupied villages around Ferizaj followed.
[15]
Before the
1913 Treaty of London
in 1913 made Ferizaj part of the
Kingdom of Serbia
, its name was changed to Uroševac after
Stefan Uroš V
of Serbia.
[16]
The beginning of the
First World War
separated
Serbia
and
Montenegro
.
[17]
In October 1915, Bulgaria entered the war and Ferizaj was part of the main artery connecting
Kumanovo
and
Skopje
with Kosovo. The city was a stopping point for the Bulgarian attack from the
Kaçanik Gorge
. Serb resistance ended on 25 November 1915, when it was conquered by the Bulgarian Army with aid from the Albanians.
[17]
The army withdrew on 1 April 1916, leaving the Prizren-Albania railway under Austro-Hungarian command.
Modern period
[
edit
]
The early
Second World War
negated a 1938 agreement between
Yugoslavia
and Turkey which would have resettled large numbers of Albanians in
Turkey
from 1939 to 1944.
[18]
After the
Axis
invasion, Italian troops were deployed in Ferizaj and its auxiliary army airport.
[19]
In 1941, the district
Communist party
encouraged enlistment in
Albania's National Liberation Movement
. After the Italian surrender the district was occupied by
Germany
, which treated the Albanian population somewhat better.
[20]
In 1943, the arrest and deportation of all National Liberation Movement participants began.
[21]
The city was liberated on 2 December 1944, and the district's economy needed to be rebuilt.
[22]

Kosovo War
[

The city of Ferizaj experienced some damage during the 1999
Kosovo War
, with some of its Albanian neighborhoods shelled and burned by the
Yugoslav People's Army
.
Camp Bondsteel
, the main base of the
United States Army
detachment of the
KFOR
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, is  on rolling hills and farmland near the city. The camp, established immediately after the war, covers 955 acres (360,000 square meters).

The recorded
military history of Puerto Rico
encompasses the period from the 16th century, when Spanish
conquistadores
battled native
Taínos
in the rebellion of 1511, to the present employment of Puerto Ricans in the
United States Armed Forces
in the military campaigns in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
.
Puerto Rico
was part of the
Spanish Empire
for four centuries, during which the people of Puerto Rico defended themselves against invasions from the
British
,
French
, and
Dutch
. Puerto Ricans fought alongside General
Bernardo de Gálvez
during the
American Revolutionary War
in the battles of
Baton Rouge
,
Mobile
,
Pensacola
and
St. Louis
. During the mid-19th century, Puerto Ricans residing in the United States fought in the
American Civil War
.
[1]
In the 1800s, the quest for Latin American independence from Spain spread to Puerto Rico, in the short-lived revolution known as the
Grito de Lares
and culminating with the
Intentona de Yauco
. The island was invaded by the United States during the
Spanish-American War
. After the war ended, Spain officially ceded the island to the United States under the terms established in the
Treaty of Paris of 1898
. Puerto Rico became a
United States territory
and the "Porto Rico Regiment" (Puerto Rico's name was changed to Porto Rico) was established on the island.
Upon the outbreak of World War I, the
U.S. Congress
approved the
Jones-Shafroth Act
, which extended
United States citizenship
(the Puerto Rican House of Delegates rejected US citizenship)
[2]
with limitations upon Puerto Ricans and made them eligible for the military
draft
. Since then, as citizens of the United States, Puerto Ricans have participated in every major United States military engagement.
During World War II, Puerto Ricans participated in the Pacific and Atlantic theaters, not only as combatants but also as commanders. It was during this conflict that Puerto Rican nurses were allowed to participate as members of the
WAACs
. Four Puerto Ricans were awarded the
Medal of Honor
, the highest military honor in the United States, for their actions during the Korean War. The members of Puerto Rico's
65th Infantry Regiment
distinguished themselves in combat in the
Korean War
and were honored with the
Congressional Gold Medal
.
[3]
During the
Vietnam War
five Puerto Ricans were awarded the Medal of Honor. Presently, Puerto Ricans continue to serve in the military of the United States.
Taíno rebellion of 1511

Main article:
Spanish-Taíno War of San Juan-Borikén
Christopher Columbus
arrived in the island of Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493, during his second voyage to the so-called "New World". The island was inhabited by the
Arawak
group of
Indigenous peoples
known as
Tainos
, who called the island "Borikén" or "Borinquen".
[4]
Columbus named the island
San Juan Bautista
in honor of
Saint John the Baptist
. The main port was named
Puerto Rico (Rich Port)
(eventually the island was renamed Puerto Rico and the port which was to evolve into the capital of the island was renamed San Juan). The conquistador
Juan Ponce de León
accompanied Columbus on this trip.
[5]
Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave)
When Ponce de León arrived in Puerto Rico, he was well received by the
Cacique
(
Tribal chief
)
Agüeybaná (The Great Sun)
, chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, some of the first colonists were farmers and miners in search of
gold
. In 1508, Ponce de León became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of
Caparra
between the modern-day cities of
Bayamón
and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos died as a result of cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as
Agüeybaná II
(The Brave), and a group of Tainos led
Diego Salcedo
, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the Taino rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces.
Guarionex
, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present-day
Aguada
) and killed eighty of its inhabitants.
[6]
Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a Taino victory.
[7]
After the Taino victory, the colonists formed a citizens'
militia
to defend themselves against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León and one of his top commanders, Diego de Salazar, led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca.
[8]
Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico.
[9]
After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by
King Ferdinand II
, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.

El Morro, Puerto Rico's main military fortification
Puerto Rico was considered the "Key to the Caribbean" by the Spanish because of its location as a way station and port for Spanish vessels.
[10]
In 1540, with revenue from Mexican mines, the Spanish settlers began the construction of
Fort San Felipe del Morro
("the promontory") in San Juan. With the completion of the initial phase of the construction in 1589
El Morro
became the island's main military fortification, guarded by professional soldiers.
[

The rest of Puerto Rico, which had been reorganized in 1580 as the
Captaincy General of Puerto Rico
,
[11]
had to rely on only a handful of soldiers and the local volunteer militia to defend the island against militant and pirate attacks.
[

The main enemies of Spain at the time were the English and the Dutch. They, however were not the only enemies that Spain faced in the Caribbean during this period. On October 11, 1528, the French sacked and burned the settlement of
San Germán
during an attempt to capture the island, destroying many of the island's first settlements—including Guánica, Sotomayor, Daguao and Loiza—before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only settlement that remained was San Juan.
[12]
In 1585,
war broke out between England and Spain
—extending to Spanish and English territories in the Americas. In November 1595,
Sir Francis Drake
and
Sir John Hawkins
attempted an
unsuccessful invasion of San Juan
. On June 15, 1598, the English fleet, led by
George Clifford
,
[13]
landed in Santurce and held the island for 157 days. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of bacillary
dysentery
among his troops, losing 700 men to the outbreak.
[14]
On December 26, 1598, Alonso de Mercado, a military man was named to the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico by Spain and asked to punish anyone who had allowed the takeover, through negligence, malice or cowardice.

Seventeenth-century Spanish painting commemorating Enrico's defeat at San Juan de Puerto Rico; by
Eugenio Caxés
The
Dutch Republic
was a world military and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the English. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain
Boudewijn Hendricksz
(also known as Boudoyno Henrico or Balduino Enrico) to capture Puerto Rico. On September 24, 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. Enrico sent a message to the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haro, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haro refused; he was an experienced military man and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.
[12]
De Haro realized that an invasion was inevitable and ordered Captain
Juan de Amézqueta
and 300 men to defend the island from
El Morro Castle
and then had the city of San Juan evacuated. He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On September 25, Hendricksz attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and
La Fortaleza
(the Governor's Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Hendricksz with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amézqueta.
[16]
The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans, who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Hendricksz set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amézqueta and Andrés Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Hendricksz and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in haste to reach their ships.
[17]
[18]
Hendricksz upon his retreat left behind him one of his largest ships, stranded, and over 400 dead.
[17]
He then tried to invade the island by attacking the town of Aguada. He was again defeated by the local militia and abandoned the idea of invading Puerto Rico.
[12]
[18]
In 1693, the
Milicias Urbanas de Puerto Rico
were organized in almost every town. Every native  male, aged between 16 and 60, was obliged to serve in these companies, unless he had an official exemption on account of physical disability or family hardship.
[19]
Captain Miguel Henriquez
While Spain and England were in a power struggle in the New World, Puerto Rican
privateering
of English ships was encouraged by the Spanish Crown. Captain
Miguel Enríquez
and Captain
Roberto Cofresí
(in the 19th century) were two of the most famous Puerto Rican privateers. In the first half of the 18th century, Henriquez, a shoemaker by occupation, decided to try his luck as a privateer. He showed great valor in intercepting English merchant ships and other ships dedicated to
contraband
that were infesting the seas of Puerto Rico and the Atlantic Ocean in general. Henriquez organized an expeditionary force which fought and defeated the English in the island of
Vieques
. He was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques to the Spanish Empire and to the governorship of Puerto Rico. In recognition of his service, the Spanish Crown awarded Henriquez the
Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie
("The Gold Medal of the Royal Effigy"), named him "Captain of the Seas and War", and gave him a
letter of marque and reprisal
, thus granting him the privileges of privateer.

Armed conflicts with the British
[
edit
]
The English continued their attacks against Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, taking minor islands including
Vieques
east of Puerto Rico. On August 5, 1702, the city of
Arecibo
, on Puerto Rico's northern coast, was invaded by the British. Armed only with spears and
machetes
, under the command of Captain
Antonio de los Reyes Correa
, 30 militia members defended the city from the English, who were armed with
muskets
and
swords
. The British were defeated, suffering 22 losses on land and 8 at sea. Reyes Correa was declared a
national hero
and was awarded the
Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie
("Gold Medal of the Royal Image") and the title of "Captain of Infantry" by
King Philip V
.
[21]
Native-born Puerto Rican (
criollos
) had petitioned the Spanish Crown to serve in the regular Spanish army, resulting in the 1741 organization of the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico. The Fijo served in the defense of Puerto Rico and other Spanish overseas possessions, performing in battles in Santo Domingo, other islands in the Caribbean, and South America, most notably in
Venezuela
. However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress the
revolution in Venezuela
caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815 it was mustered out of service.
[22]
In 1765, the Spanish Crown sent
Field Marshal
Alejandro O'Reilly
to Puerto Rico to form an organized militia. O'Reilly, known as the "Father of the Puerto Rican Militia", oversaw training to bring fame and glory to the militia in future military engagements, nicknaming the civilian militia the "Disciplined Militia." O'Reilly was later appointed governor of colonial
Louisiana
in 1769 and became known as "Bloody O'Reilly."

American Revolutionary War
[
edit
]
Brigadier General Ramón de Castro
During the
American Revolutionary War
, Spain lent the rebelling colonists the use of its ports in Puerto Rico, through which flowed financial aid and arms for their cause. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayagüez, in 1777, between two
Continental Navy
ships, the
Eudawook
and the
Henry
, and a Royal Navy warship,
HMS
Glasgow
. Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful
Glasgow
. The American colonial ships were close to the coast of
Mayagüez
; members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing that something was wrong, signaled for the ships to dock at the town's bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayagüezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the
Glasgow
became aware of the situation and asked the island's governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships. Dufresne refused and ordered the British warship out of the Puerto Rican dock.
[25]
The governor of Louisiana,
Bernardo de Gálvez
, was named field marshal of the Spanish colonial army in North America. In 1779, Galvez and his troops, composed of Puerto Ricans and people from other Spanish colonies, distracted the British from the revolution by capturing
Pensacola
, the capital of the British colony of
West Florida
and the cities of
Baton Rouge
,
St. Louis
and
Mobile
. The Puerto Rican troops, under the leadership of Brigadier General Ramón de Castro,
[26]
helped defeat the British and Indian army of 2,500 soldiers and British warships in Pensacola.
[27]
Galvez and his multinational army also provided the Continental Army with guns, cloth, gunpowder and medicine shipped from
Cuba
up the
Mississippi River
. General Ramón de Castro, who was Galvez's Aide-de-camp in the Mobile and Pensacola campaigns, became the appointed governor of Puerto Rico in 1795.

Uniform used by the Freed Black Militia of Puerto Rico
On February 17, 1797, the governor of Puerto Rico Brigadier General Ramón de Castro, received news that Great Britain had
invaded the island of Trinidad
. Believing that Puerto Rico would be the next British objective he decided to put the local militia on alert and to prepare the island's forts against any military action. On April 17, 1797, British ships under the command of Sir
Ralph Abercromby
approached the coastal town of
Loíza
, to the east of San Juan. On April 18, British and
Hessian
troops landed on Loíza's beach.
[30]
Under the command of de Castro, British ships were shot at by artillery from both El Morro and the San Gerónimo fortresses but were beyond reach. After the invaders disembarked practically all fighting was land based with many skirmishes, field artillery and mortar fire exchanges between the San Gerónimo and San Antonio Bridge fortress and British emplacements in Condado to the East and El Olimpo hill in Miramar to the South. The British tried to take the San Antonio, a key passage to the San Juan islet, and repeatedly bombarded the nearby San Gerónimo almost demolishing it. At the Martín Peña Bridge, they were met by the likes of Sergeants
José and Francisco Díaz
and Colonel
Rafael Conti
who together with Lieutenant Lucas de Fuentes attacked the enemy with two cannons. After fierce fighting by the Spanish forces and local militia, they were defeated in all attempts to advance into San Juan. The invasion failed because Puerto Rican volunteers and Spanish troops fought back and defended the island in a manner described by a British lieutenant as of "astonishing bravery".

"La Rogativa" folklore
[
edit
]
The defense of San Juan served as the base for the legend of "La Rogativa".  According to the popular Puerto Rican legend, on the night of April 30, 1797, the townswomen, led by a bishop, formed a
rogativa
(prayer procession) and marched throughout the streets of the city singing hymns and carrying torches while at the same time praying for the deliverance of the city. Outside the walls, the invaders mistook the torch-lit movement for the arrival of Spanish reinforcements. When morning came, the enemy was gone from the island and the city was saved from a possible invasion. Four statues, sculptured by
Lindsay Daen
in the
Plazuela de la Rogativa
(Rogativa Plaza) in
Old San Juan
, pay tribute to the bishop and townswomen who participated in
La Rogativa
.
[31]
[32]
Attack of Aguadilla
[
edit
]
The British also attacked
Aguadilla
and Punta Salinas. They were defeated by Colonel Conti and the members of the militia in Aguadilla, and the British troops that had landed on the island were taken prisoner. The British retreated on April 30 to their ships and on May 2 set sail northward. Because of the defeat given to the British forces, governor Ramon de Castro petitioned Spanish King
Charles IV
for recognition for the victors; he was promoted to field marshal and several others were promoted and given pay raises.
[12]
[33]
The British persisted in invading Puerto Rico, after Abercromby's defeat, with unsuccessful skirmishes on the coastal towns of Aguadilla (December 1797), Ponce, Cabo Rojo, and Mayagüez. This continued to occur until 1802 when the
Treaty of Amiens
ended the
War of the Second Coalition
between European powers and Revolutionary France.

Field Marshal Demetrio O'Daly
France had threatened to invade the Spanish colony of
Santo Domingo
. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, under the command of Puerto Rican Captain
Ramón Power y Giralt
, to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the French by enforcing a
blockade
. Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention of defending the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed as heroes by the Spanish Government.
[35]
San Juan native
Demetrio O'Daly
was a Sergeant Major in the Spanish Army when he participated in the 1809
Peninsular War
, also known as the Spanish War of Independence, after the Napoleonic Invasion of 1808 and the kidnapping of both King Charles IV and Prince Ferdinand (later King
Ferdinand VII
). When King Ferdinand returned from exile and kidnapping, he repealed the Constitution of 1812, which as the rest of European monarchs, he felt was a Napoleonic maneuver to weaken the countries. But O'Daly was a defender of the
Spanish Constitution of 1812
and was considered a rebel and exiled from Spain by
King Fernando VII
in 1814. In 1820 O'Daly, a liberal constitutionalist, together with fellow rebel Col. Rafael Riego organized and led the Revolt of the Colonels. It was not a revolt against the king, but a revolt to force him reinstate the constitution which was successful. This was called the Trienio Liberal/Liberal Three years (1820-23). During this process O'Daly was promoted to field marshal and awarded the
Cruz Laureada de San Fernando
(Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand), the highest military decoration awarded by the Spanish government.

Lieutenant Augusto Rodríguez
During the 1800s, commerce existed between the ports of the eastern coast of the United States and Puerto Rico. Ship records show that many Puerto Ricans traveled on ships that sailed to and from the  U.S. and Puerto Rico. Many of them settled in places such as New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Upon the outbreak of the
American Civil War
, many Puerto Ricans joined the ranks of the United States military armed forces, however since Puerto Ricans were Spanish subjects they were inscribed as Spaniards. The 1860 census of New Haven, Connecticut, shows there were 10 Puerto Ricans living there. Among them was
Augusto Rodriguez
who joined the 15th Connecticut Regiment (a.k.a. Lyon Regiment) in 1862. During the Civil War, Rodriguez, who reached the rank of lieutenant, served in the defenses of Washington, D.C. He also led his men in the Battles of
Fredericksburg
and
Wyse Fork
. The regiment was mustered out on June 27, 1865, and he was discharged in New Haven on July 12, 1865.
[1]
Slave revolts
[
edit
]
Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873, but the wealth amassed by many landowners in Puerto Rico through a plantation economy was generated by the exploitation of slaves. According to one source, this reliance on slavery "generated its antithesis—disobedience, uprisings and flights."
[38]
In Puerto Rico, there were many minor slave revolts in which the slaves clashed with the military establishment. In July 1821,
Marcos Xiorro
, a bozal slave, planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government of Puerto Rico. According to his plot, which was to be carried out on July 27, during the festival celebrations for Santiago (
St. James
), several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayamón, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, C. Kortnight, Miguel Andino and
Fernando Fernández
. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve
cutlasses
and swords which were hidden in those fields.
[39]
Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and
Toa Baja
and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not
black
. After this, they would all unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of
Río Piedras
,
Guaynabo
and Palo Seco. With this
critical mass
of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of
San Juan
, where they would declare Xiorro as their king.
[39]
Unfortunately for the slave conspirators, the plot was divulged by a fellow slave to the authorities.
[

In response, the mayor of Bayamón mobilized 500 soldiers. The ringleaders and followers of the conspiracy were captured immediately. A total of 61 slaves were imprisoned in Bayamón and San Juan.
[39]
The ringleaders were executed and the fate of Xiorro remains a mystery.
[39]
There were other minor revolts up until the abolition of slavery in the island became official.

General
Antonio Valero de Bernabé
, the "Liberator from Puerto Rico"
In 1822, there was an attempt, known as the
Ducoudray Holstein Expedition
, conceived, carefully planned and organized by General
Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein
to invade Puerto Rico and declare it a republic.
[40]
This invasion was different from all its precursors since none before had intended to make Puerto Rico an independent nation, and use the Taino name "Boricua" as the official name of the republic, it was also intended more as a mercantile venture than a patriotic endeavor. It was the first time an invasion intended to make the city of Mayagüez the capital of the island.
[40]
However, plans of the invasion were soon disclosed to the Spanish authorities and the plot never materialized.

United Provinces of New Granada
[

In the early 19th century the Spanish colonies, in what is known as the
Latin American wars of independence
, began to revolt against Spanish rule.
Antonio Valero de Bernabé
was a Puerto Rican military leader known in Latin America as the "Liberator from Puerto Rico". Valero was a recent graduate of the Spanish Military Academy when
Napoleon Bonaparte
convinced King Charles IV of Spain to permit him to pass through Spanish soil with the sole purpose of attacking Portugal. When Napoleon refused to leave, the Spanish government declared war. Valero joined the Spanish Army and helped defeat Napoleon's army at the
siege of Saragossa
. Valero became a hero; he was promoted to the rank of colonel and was awarded many decorations.
[41]
When
Ferdinand VII
assumed the throne of Spain in 1813, Valero became critical of the new king's policies towards the Spanish colonies in Latin America. He developed a keen hatred of the monarchy, resigned his commission in the army, and headed for Mexico. There he joined the insurgent army headed by
Agustín de Iturbide
, in which Valero was named chief of staff. He fought for and helped achieve
Mexico's independence
from Spain. After the Mexican victory, Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico. Since Valero had developed anti-monarchist feelings following his experiences in Spain, he revolted against Iturbide. His revolt failed and he attempted to escape from Mexico by way of sea.
[41]
Valero was captured by a Spanish pirate, who turned him over to the Spanish authorities in Cuba. Valero was imprisoned but managed to escape with the help of a group of men that identified with
Simón Bolívar
's ideals. Upon learning of Bolívar's dream of creating a unified Latin America, including Puerto Rico and Cuba, Valero decided to join him. Valero stopped in
St. Thomas
, where he established contacts with the Puerto Rican independence movement.
[
citation needed
]
He then traveled to Venezuela, where he was met by General
Francisco de Paula Santander
.
[41]
He next joined Bolívar and fought alongside "The Liberator" against Spain, gaining his confidence and admiration. Valero was named Military Chief of the Department of Panama, Governor of Puerto Cabello, Chief of Staff of Colombia, Minister of War and Maritime of Venezuela, and in 1849 was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.
[42]
María de las Mercedes Barbudo
The meetings of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities and the members of the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan rebel leader José María Rojas sent to
María de las Mercedes Barbudo
, Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in danger of being discovered.
[43]
Mercedes Barbudo, also known as the "first Puerto Rican female freedom fighter", was a businesswoman who became a follower of the independence ideal for Puerto Rico upon learning that Bolivar dreamed of eventually engendering an American Revolution-style federation, that would be known as the
United Provinces of New Granada
, between all the newly independent republics, with a government ideally set-up solely to recognize and uphold individual rights. She was involved with the Puerto Rican Independence Movement which had ties with the Venezuelan rebels led by
Simón Bolívar
and who were against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico.
[44]
Unknown to Mercedes Barbudo, the Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico under Governor
Miguel de la Torre
, were suspicious of the correspondence between her and the rebel factions of Venezuela. Secret agents of the Spanish Government had retained some of her mail and delivered it to Governor de la Torre. He ordered an investigation and had her mail confiscated. The Government believed that the correspondence served as propaganda of the Bolivian ideals and that it would also serve to motivate Puerto Ricans to seek their independence.
[45]
Governor Miguel de la Torre ordered her arrest on the charge that she planned to overthrow the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. Since Puerto Rico did not have a women's prison she was held without bail at the Castillo San Cristóbal. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was Rojas letter. She was exiled to Cuba, where she was able to escape and make her way to Venezuela, where she spent her final days.

Fort San Cristóbal Cannon
The Spanish government had received many complaints from the nations whose ships were attacked by Puerto Rican pirate Captain
Roberto Cofresí
. Cofresí and his men had attacked eight ships, amongst them an American ship. The Spanish government, which routinely encouraged piracy against other nations, was pressured and felt obliged to pursue and capture the famous pirate. In 1824, Captain John Slout of the U.S. Naval Forces and his schooner
USS
Grampus
engaged Cofresí in a fierce battle. The pirate Cofresí was captured, along with eleven of his crew members, and turned over to the Spanish Government. He was imprisoned in El Castillo del Morro in San Juan. Cofresi was judged by a Spanish Council of War, found guilty, and executed by firing squad on March 29, 1825.
[46]
On April 13, 1855, a
mutiny
broke out among the artillerymen at
Fort San Cristóbal
. They were protesting an extended two years of military service imposed by the island's Spanish governor, Garcia Cambia. The mutineers pointed their cannons towards San Juan, creating a state of panic among the population. Upon their surrender, the governor had the eight men arrested and
sentenced to death
by
firing squad
.

Grito de Lares
[

Main article:
Grito de Lares
Many Spanish colonies had gained their independence by the mid-1850s. In Puerto Rico, there were two groups: the loyalists, who were loyal to Spain, and the
independentistas
, who advocated independence. In 1866, Dr.
Ramón Emeterio Betances
,
Segundo Ruiz Belvis
, and other independence advocates met in New York City where they founded the
Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico
. An outcome of this venture was a plan to send an armed expedition from the
Dominican Republic
to invade the island. Several revolutionary cells were formed in the western towns and cities of Puerto Rico. Two of the most important cells were at Mayagüez, led by
Mathias Brugman
and code-named "Capa Prieto" and at Lares, code-named "Centro Bravo" and headed by
Manuel Rojas
. "Centro Bravo" was the main center of operations and was located in the Rojas plantation of El Triunfo. Manuel Rojas was named "Commander of the Liberation Army" by Betances.
Mariana Bracetti
(sister-in-law of Manuel) was named "Leader of the Lares Revolutionary Council." Upon the request of Betances, Bracetti knitted the first flag of Puerto Rico also known as the revolutionary
Flag of Lares
(
Bandera de Lares
).
[48]
Ramón Emeterio Betances
The Spanish authorities discovered the plot and were able to confiscate Betances's armed ship before it arrived in Puerto Rico. The Mayor of the town of
Camuy
, Manuel González (leader of that town's revolutionary cell), was arrested and charged with treason. He learned that the Spanish Army was aware of the independence plot, and escaped to warn Manuel Rojas. Alerted, the revolutionists decided to start the revolution as soon as possible, and set the date for September 28, 1868. Mathias Brugman and his men joined with Manuel Rojas's men and with about 800 men and women, marched on and took the town of Lares. This was to be known as "
Grito de Lares
" (The Cry of Lares) The revolutionists entered the town's church and placed Mariana Bracetti's revolutionary flag on the High Altar as a sign that the revolution had begun. They declared Puerto Rico to be the "Republic of Puerto Rico" and named
Francisco Ramírez
its President. Manuel and his poorly armed followers proceeded to march on to the town of
San Sebastián
, armed only with clubs and machetes. The Spanish Army had been forewarned, and awaited with superior firepower. The revolutionists were met with deadly fire. The revolt failed, many revolutionists were killed, and at least 475, including Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti, were imprisoned in the jail of Arecibo and sentenced to death.
[49]
[50]
Others fled and went into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Quiñones; he was captured and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of native-born Puerto Ricans, and also the Compañia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.

During the Intentona de Yauco, the current Puerto Rican Flag was flown on the island for the first time
Leaders of
El Grito de Lares
who were in exile in New York City joined the
Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee
, founded on December 8, 1895, to continue the quest for independence. In 1897, with the aid of
Antonio Mattei Lluberas
and Fidel Velez, the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising, which became known as the
Intentona de Yauco
. On March 26, 1897, there was a second and last major attempt to overthrow the Spanish government. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities, who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.

General Juan Ríus Rivera, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army
In 1869, the incoming governor of Puerto Rico, Jose Laureano Sanz, in an effort to ease tensions in the island, dictated a general
amnesty
and released all who were involved with the
Grito de Lares
revolt from prison. Both Mariana Bracetti and Manuel Rojas were released. Bracetti lived her last years in the town of Añasco, while Rojas was deported to Venezuela.
[52]
Many of the former prisoners joined the Cuban Liberation Army and fought against Spain. Among the many Puerto Ricans who volunteered to fight for Cuba's independence were Juan Ríus Rivera, Francisco Gonzalo Marín, also known as "Pachin Marín" and José Semidei Rodríguez.

Juan Ríus Rivera
as a young man met and befriended Betances. He eventually joined the pro-independence movement in the island. He became a member of the Mayagüez revolutionary cell "Capá Prieto" under the command of Brugman. Ríus, did not participate directly in the revolt because at the time he was studying law in Spain, however, he was an avid reader about information pertaining to the
Antilles
and learned about the failed revolt. He interrupted his studies and traveled to the United States where he went to the Cuba Revolutionary "Junta" and offered his services. He joined the Cuban Liberation Army and was given the rank of general and fought alongside Gen.
Máximo Gómez
in Cuba's
Ten Years' War
. He later fought alongside Gen.
Antonio Maceo Grajales
and upon Maceo's death was named Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army. After Cuba gained its independence, Gen. Juan Ríus Rivera became an active political figure in the new nation.
[53]
Francisco Gonzalo Marín
was a poet and journalist in Puerto Rico who joined the Cuban Liberation Army upon learning of the death of his brother Wecenlao in the battlefields of Cuba. Marin, who was given the rank of lieutenant, befriended and fought alongside
José Martí
. In November 1897, Lt. Marin died from the wounds he received in a skirmish against the Spanish Army.
[54]
José Semidei Rodríguez
from Yauco, Puerto Rico, fought in various battles in the Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898). After Cuba gained its independence he joined the Cuban National Army with the rank of brigadier general. Semidei Rodríguez continued to serve in Cuba as a diplomat upon his retirement from the military.

Spanish-American War
[

Main article:
Spanish-American War
In 1890, Captain
Alfred Thayer Mahan
, a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker, wrote a book titled
The Influence of Sea Power upon History
where he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea which would serve as coaling and naval stations and which would serve as strategic points of defense upon the construction of a canal in the
Isthmus
.
[56]
This was not a new idea:
William H. Seward
, the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents, among them
Abraham Lincoln
and
Ulysses Grant
, had stressed that a canal be built either in
Honduras
,
Nicaragua
or
Panama
and that the United States annex the
Dominican Republic
and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive the approval of the U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba.
[56]
Since 1894 the
Naval War College
had been formulating plans for war with possible adversaries. One of these plans included military operations in Puerto Rican waters. Not only was Puerto Rico considered valuable as a naval station, Puerto Rico and Cuba were also major producers of sugar, a valuable commercial commodity the United States lacked.
[57]
The United States declared war on Spain in 1898 following the loss of the battleship
USS
Maine
in Havana harbor, Cuba. One of the United States' principal objectives in the Spanish-American War was to take control of Spanish possessions Puerto Rico and Cuba in the Atlantic, and the
Philippines
and
Guam
in the Pacific.
[58]
3rd Provisional Battalion of Puerto Rico
.
The Spanish sent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions to defend Cuba against the American invaders. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Cavalry and
Krupp
artillery, was sent to
Santiago de Cuba
where they fought American forces in the
Battle of San Juan Hill
. The Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70% casualties including dead, wounded, MIAs and prisoners.
[59]
The invasion of Puerto Rico by the American military forces was known as the
Puerto Rican Campaign
. On May 10, 1898, Spanish forces under the command of Captain
Ángel Rivero Méndez
in the fortress of San Cristóbal in San Juan, exchanged fire with the
USS
Yale
, and on May 12 a fleet of 12 American ships bombarded San Juan.
[60]
On June 25, the
USS
Yosemite
arrived in San Juan and blockaded the port. Captains
Ramón Acha Caamaño
and José Antonio Iriarte, both natives of Puerto Rico, were among those who defended the city from Fort San Felipe del Morro. They had three batteries under their command, which were armed with at least three 15 cm Ordóñez cannons. The battle lasted three hours and resulted in the death of Justo Esquivies, the first Puerto Rican soldier to die in the Puerto Rican Campaign.
[60]
On July 25, General
Nelson A. Miles
landed at the southern town of
Guánica
and began advancing towards Ponce and then San Juan.
[61]
Part of the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, where the Battle of Yauco took place in 1898
One of the most notable battles during the Puerto Rico Campaign occurred between combined Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers, led by Captain Salvador Meca and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, and American forces led by Brigadier General George A. Garretson on July 26, 1898. The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in the
Battle of Yauco
. Puig and his forces suffered 2 officers and 3 soldiers wounded and 2 soldiers dead. The Spanish forces were ordered to retreat.
[62]
The Puerto Rican Campaign was short compared to the other campaigns because the Puerto Ricans who resided in the southern and western towns and villages resented Spanish rule and tended to view the Americans as their liberators, thereby making the invasion much easier. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions were in Cuba defending that island, which may have also contributed. However, the Americans met resistance from the Spanish forces and Puerto Rican Volunteers and were engaged in the following battles: Battle of Fajardo, Battle of Guayama, Battle of the Guamani River Bridge, Battle of Coamo, Battle of Silva Heights and Battle of Asomante.
[62]
On August 13, 1898, the Spanish-American War ended and the Spanish surrendered without other major incidents. Some Puerto Rican leaders such as
José de Diego
and
Eugenio María de Hostos
expected the United States to grant the island its independence.
[63]
[64]
Believing that Puerto Rico would gain its independence, a group of men staged an uprising in Ciales which became known as "El Levantamiento de Ciales" or the "Ciales Uprising of 1898" and proclaimed Puerto Rico to be a republic. The Spanish authorities who were unaware that the cease fire had been signed brutally suppressed the uprising.
[65]
The total casualties of the Puerto Rican Campaign were 450 dead or wounded Spanish and Puerto Ricans, and 4 dead and 39 wounded Americans.
[66]
Upon the signing of the
Treaty of Paris
on December 10, Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States. The Spanish troops had already left by October 18, and the United States named General Nelson A. Miles military governor of the island. On July 1, 1899, "The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army" was created, and approved by the
U.S. Congress
on May 27, 1908. The regiment was a segregated, all-volunteer unit made up of 1,969 Puerto Ricans.

Puerto Rican commander in the Philippines
[

In 1897, before the onset of fighting in Puerto Rico,
Juan Alonso Zayas
, born in San Juan, was a second lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to head for the Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in
Baler
. He arrived in
Manila
, the capital, in May 1897. There, he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of
Luzon
. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100 km); if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230 km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.
[67]
[68]
Baler (San Luis Obispo de Tolosa) church.
The independence advocates, under the leadership of Colonel Calixto Vilacorte, were called "
insurgents
" (
Tagalos
) by the Spanish. On June 28, 1898, they demanded the surrender of the Spanish army. The Spanish governor of the region, Enrique de las Morena y Fossi, refused. The Filipinos immediately attacked Baler in a battle that was to last for seven months. Despite being outnumbered and suffering hunger and disease, the battalion did not capitulate. In the meantime, Zayas and the rest of the battalion were totally unaware of the Spanish-American War. In August, 1898, hostilities between the United States and Spain came to an end. The Philippines became a U.S. possession in accordance with the Treaty of Paris. In May, 1899, the battalion at Baler learned of the Spanish-American War and its aftermath. On June 2, 1899, the battalion's commander, Lieutenant Martín Cerezo, surrendered to the Tagalos. The surrender was dependent upon several conditions, including the Spaniards not being treated as prisoners of war and being allowed to travel to a ship that would take them back to Spain. The 32 survivors of Zayas Battalion were sent to Manila, where they boarded a ship for Spain. In Spain, they were given a hero's welcome and became known as
los Ultimos de Baler
—"the Last of Baler".

On March 2, 1898, Congress authorized the creation of the first body of native troops in Puerto Rico. On June 30, 1901, the "Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry" came into being. An Act of Congress, approved on May 27, 1908, reorganized the regiment as part of the "regular" Army. Since the native Puerto Rican officers were Puerto Rican citizens and not citizens of the United States, they were required to undergo a new physical examination to determine their fitness for commissions in the Regular Army and to take an oath of U.S. citizenship with their new officers oath.

Major General Luis R. Esteves (Army)
Main article:
Puerto Rico National Guard
In 1906, a group of Puerto Ricans met with the appointed Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rico National Guard. The petition failed because the
U.S. Constitution
prohibits the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without the authorization of Congress.
On June 19, 1915, Major General
Luis R. Esteves
of the
U.S. Army
became the first Puerto Rican and the first Hispanic to graduate from the
United States Military Academy
at
West Point, New York
. While he attended West Point, he tutored classmate
Dwight D. Eisenhower
in Spanish; a second language was required in order to graduate. He was a second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Brigade under the command of
John J. Pershing
when he was sent to
El Paso, Texas
, in the
Pancho Villa Expedition
. From El Paso, he was sent to the town of Polvo, where he was appointed mayor and judge by its citizens. Esteves helped organize the 23rd Battalion, which would be composed of Puerto Ricans and be stationed in
Panama
during World War I. He also played a key role in the formation of the
Puerto Rico National Guard
.

Camp Las Casas
was established in
Santurce
under the command of Lt. Colonel Orval P. Townshend. The Porto Rico Regiment was assigned to the camp. The regiment consisted of two battalions of the former Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry.
[71]
Lieutenant
Teófilo Marxuach
was the officer of the day at El Morro Castle on March 21, 1915. The
Odenwald
, built in 1903 (not to be confused with the German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the
San Juan Bay
and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnacion Correa manned a machine gun and fired warning shots with little effect.
[37]
Marxuach fired a shot from a cannon located at the Santa Rosa battery of "El Morro" fort, in what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the colors of the
Central Powers
,
[72]
forcing the
Odenwald
to stop and to return to port where its supplies were confiscated. The
Odenwald
was confiscated by the United States and renamed
SS Newport
. It was assigned to the U.S. Shipping Board, where it served until 1924 when it was retired.

As more countries became involved in World War I, the U.S. Congress approved the
Jones-Shafroth Act
, which imposed United States
citizenship
upon Puerto Ricans.
[74]
Those who were eligible, with the exception of women, were expected to serve in the military. About 20,000 Puerto Ricans were
drafted
during World War I.
[75]
On May 3, 1917, the regiment recruited 1,969 men. The 295th and 296 Infantry Regiments were created in Puerto Rico.
[76]
In November 1917, the first military draft (
conscription
) lottery in Puerto Rico was held in the island's capital, San Juan. Eustaquio Correa was the first Puerto Rican to be drafted into the Armed Forces of the United States.
[77]
On May 17, 1917, the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was deployed to guard the
Panama Canal
.
[78]
One of the Puerto Ricans who distinguished himself during World War I was Lieutenant
Frederick Lois Riefkohl
of the US Navy, who on August 2, 1917, became the first known
Puerto Rican to be awarded the Navy Cross
. The
Navy Cross
was awarded to Lt. Riefkohl for his actions in an engagement with an enemy submarine. Lt. Riefkohl, who was also the first Puerto Rican to graduate from the United States Naval Academy, served as a rear admiral in World War II.
[79]
Frederick L. Riefkohl's brother,
Rudolph William Riefkohl
also served.  Riefkohl was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the 63rd Heavy Artillery Regiment in France, where he participated in the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive
. According to the
United States War Department
, after the war he served as
Captain
of Coastal Artillery at the
Letterman Army Medical Center

By 1918, the Army realized there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty, who were required in military operating rooms. To address the need, the Army began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr.
Dolores Piñero
from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.

In
New York
, some Puerto Ricans joined the
369th Infantry Regiment
,
[82]
which was mostly composed of
African-Americans
. They were not allowed to fight alongside their white counterparts, but did serve as part of a French division. They fought on the
Western Front
in France, and their reputation earned them the nickname of "the Harlem Hell Fighters" by the
Germans
.
[83]
Among them was
Rafael Hernández Marín
, considered by many as Puerto Rico's greatest composer.

It is estimated that 18,000 Puerto Ricans from the Porto Rico Regiment served in the war and that 335 were wounded by chemical gas experimentation the United States conducted as part of its active chemical weapons program in Panama.
[88]
Neither the military nor the War Department of the United States kept statistics in regard to the total number of Puerto Ricans who served in the regular units of the Armed Forces (United States mainland forces). It is known that four Puerto Ricans died in combat, but it is impossible to determine the exact number of Puerto Ricans who served and died in World War I.

The need for a Puerto Rican National Guard unit became apparent to Major General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as an instructor of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at
Camp Las Casas
in Puerto Rico. His request was approved by the government and Puerto Rican Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard was formed, and General Luis R. Esteves became the first official Commandant of the Puerto Rican National Guard.

Puerto Ricans fought on both sides during the
Spanish Civil War
. The Spanish Civil War was a major conflict in Spain that started after an attempted
coup d'état
by parts of the
army
, led by the
Fascist
General Francisco Franco
, against the government of the
Second Spanish Republic
. Puerto Ricans fought on both of the factions involved; the "Nationalists" as members of the Spanish Army and the "Loyalists" (Republicans) as members of the
Abraham Lincoln International Brigade
.
[95]
Among the Puerto Ricans who fought alongside General Franco and the Nationalists was General Manuel Goded Llopis (1882-1936). Llopis, who was born in San Juan, was named Chief of Staff of the
Spanish Army of Africa
after his victories in the Rif War, took the
Balearic Islands
and by order of Franco, suppressed the rebellion of
Asturias
. Llopis was sent to lead the fight against the Anarchists in
Catalonia
, but his troops were outnumbered. He was captured and was sentenced to die by firing squad.

Among the many Puerto Ricans who fought for the Second Spanish Republic as members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was
Lieutenant
Carmelo Delgado Delgado
(1913-1937), a leader of the
Puerto Rican Nationalist Party
from
Guayama
. At the start of the Spanish Civil War Delgado was in Spain studying for a law degree. Delgado was an
anti-fascist

Map of U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads
In 1940, when Germany attacked Great Britain, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
ordered the construction of a protected anchorage in the Atlantic, at Ceiba, Puerto Rico, similar to
Pearl Harbor
in Hawaii. The site was meant to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60% of the Atlantic Fleet. The naval base, which was named
U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads
, became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass. In May 2003, after six decades of existence, the base was officially shut down by the U.S. Navy.
[99]
[100]
In 1939, a survey was conducted of possible air base sites. It was determined that Punta Borinquen was the best site for a major air base. Later that year, Major Karl S. Axtater assumed command of what was to become Borinquen Army Air Field (later renamed Ramey Air Force Base). The first squadron based at Borinquen Field was the 27th Bombardment Squadron, consisting of nine
Douglas B-18A Bolo
medium bombers. In 1940, the air echelon of the 25th Bombardment Group (14 B-18A aircraft and two
Northrop A-17
aircraft) arrived at the base from Langley Field.
[101]
Throughout the war, many squadrons rotated through the airbase, which was supported by numerous antiaircraft, coastal artillery and support units. Borinquen Field was also used as a part of the ferrying route for aircraft being moved from Florida to the Middle East.

There were no Puerto Rican military-related fatalities in the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, although one Puerto Rican civilian was killed. Daniel LaVerne was an amateur boxer who was working at Pearl Harbor's Red Hill underground fuel tank construction project when the Japanese attacked. He died as a result of the injuries which he received during the attack. His name is listed among the 2,338 Americans killed or mortally wounded on December 7, 1941, in the Remembrance Exhibit on the back lawn of the
USS Arizona Memorial
Visitor Center at Pearl Harbor.
[105]
It is estimated by the Department of Defense that 65,034 Puerto Ricans served in the U.S. military during World War II.
[88]
[106]
Soldiers from the island, serving in the 65th Infantry Regiment, participated in combat in the
European Theater
- in Germany and Central Europe. Those who resided in the mainland of the United States were assigned to regular units of the military and served either in the European or
Pacific theaters
of the war. Some families had multiple members join the Armed Forces. Seven brothers of the Medina family known as "The Fighting Medinas", fought in the war. They came from
Río Grande, Puerto Rico
, and Brooklyn, New York.

In some cases Puerto Ricans were subject to the racial discrimination which at that time was widespread in the United States.

"The Fighting Medinas"
World War II was also the first conflict in which women, other than nurses, were allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the volunteers migrated to the mainland U.S. to work in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not have to deal with the language barriers when tending to wounded Hispanic soldiers. Among them was Second Lieutenant
Carmen Lozano Dumler
, who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers.
[108]
In 1944, the Army sought to recruit up to 200 Puerto Rican women for the
Women's Army Corps
(WAC). Over 1,000 applications were received. The Puerto Rican WAC unit, designated Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, was a segregated Hispanic unit. It was assigned to the
New York Port of Embarkation
after basic training at
Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia
. The WACs were assigned to work in military offices which planned the shipment of troops around the world.
[109]
Among them was PFC
Carmen García Rosado
, who in 2006, authored and published a book titled "LAS WACS - Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Segunda Guerra Mundial" (The WACs - The participation of the Puerto Rican women in the Second World War), the first book to document the experiences of the first 200 Puerto Rican women who participated in said conflict.
[110]
According to García Rosado, one of the hardships which
Puerto Rican women in the military
were subjected to was social and racial discrimination against the Latino community, which at the time was rampant in the United States.

The 149th
Women's Army Auxiliary Corps
(WAAC) Post Headquarters Company was the first WAAC Company to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe in January 1943. The unit arrived in Northern Africa on January 27, 1943, and rendered overseas duties in
Algiers
within General Dwight D. Eisenhower's theater headquarters. Tech4
Carmen Contreras-Bozak
, a member of this unit, was the first Hispanic to serve in the Women's Army Corps as an interpreter and in numerous administrative positions.
[111]
The 65th Infantry, after an extensive training program in 1942, was sent to Panama to protect the Pacific and the Atlantic sides of the
isthmus
in 1943. On November 25, 1943, Colonel
Antulio Segarra
, proceeded Col. John R. Menclenhall as Commander of the 65th Infantry, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican Regular Army officer to command a Regular Army regiment.
[112]
On January 12, 1944, the 296th Infantry Regiment departed from Puerto Rico to the Panama Canal Zone. In April 1945, the unit returned to Puerto Rico and soon after was sent to
Honolulu
,
Hawaii
. The 296th arrived on June 25, 1945, and was attached to the Central Pacific Base Command at Kahuku Air Base.
[113]
Lieutenant Colonel
Gilberto José Marxuach
, "The Father of the San Juan Civil Defense", was the commander of both the 1114th Artillery Co. and the 1558th Engineers Co.
[114]
Also in January 1944, the 65th Infantry Regiment was moved from Panama to
Fort Eustis
in
Newport News, Virginia
, in preparation for overseas deployment to North Africa. An advance party was sent to
Casablanca
on 16 March, with the remainder of the regiment arriving by 5 April.
[115]
For some Puerto Ricans, this would be the first time that they were away from their homeland. Being away from their homeland for the first time would serve as an inspiration for compositions of two
Bolero
's; "
En mi viejo San Juan

[116]
and "Despedida" (My Good-bye), a farewell song written by
Pedro Flores
and interpreted by
Daniel Santos

By April 29, 1944, the regiment had landed in Italy and moved on to
Corsica
. On 1 October 1944, the 65th Infantry landed in France and was committed to action on the
Maritime Alps
at Peira Cava. On December 13, 1944, the 65th Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel
Juan César Cordero Dávila
, relieved the 2nd Battalion,
442nd Infantry Regiment
, a regiment which was made up of
Japanese Americans
under the command of Col.
Virgil R. Miller
, a native of Puerto Rico. The 3rd Battalion fought against and defeated Germany's
34th Infantry Division
's 107th Infantry Regiment. There were 17 battle casualties. These included Pvt. Sergio Sanchez-Sanchez and Sergeant Angel Martinez, from the town of Sabana Grande, who were the first two Puerto Ricans from the 65th Infantry to be killed in combat. On March 18, 1945, the regiment was sent to the
District of Mannheim
and assigned to
military occupation
duties.

[122]
Cordero was named regimental commander of the 52nd Infantry Regiment of the new Filipino Army, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to command a Filipino Army regiment. The Bataan Defense Force surrendered on April 9, 1942, and Cordero and his men underwent brutal torture and humiliation during the
Bataan Death March
and nearly four years of captivity. He was one of nearly 1,600 members of the 31st Infantry who were taken as prisoners. Half of these men perished while prisoners of the Japanese forces.

Human experimentation
[

Puerto Rican soldiers were subject to human experimentation by the United States Armed Forces. On Panama's San Jose Island, Puerto Rican soldiers were exposed to
mustard gas
to see if they reacted differently than their "white" counterparts.
[133]
According to Susan L. Smith of the University of Alberta, the researchers were searching for evidence of race-based differences in the responses of the human body to mustard gas exposure.

LTJG Maria Rodriguez Denton
The American participation in the Second World War came to an end in Europe on May 8, 1945, when the western Allies celebrated "
V-E Day
" (Victory in Europe Day) upon Germany's surrender, and in the Asian theater on August 14, 1945 "
V-J Day
" (Victory over Japan Day) when the
Japanese surrendered
by signing the
Japanese Instrument of Surrender
. Lieutenant Junior Grade
Maria Rodriguez Denton
(U.S. Navy), born in Guanica, Puerto Rico, was the first woman from Puerto Rico who became an officer in the United States Navy as member of the
WAVES
. It was LTJG Denton who forwarded the news (through channels) to President Harry S. Truman that the war had ended.
[108]
On October 27, 1945, the 65th Infantry sailed home from France. Arriving at Puerto Rico on November 9, 1945, they were received by the local population as national heroes and given a victorious reception at the Military Terminal of Camp Buchanan.
[135]
According to the book "Historia Militar De Puerto Rico" (Military history of Puerto Rico), by historian Col.
Héctor Andrés Negroni
, the men of the 65th Infantry were awarded the following military decorations: 2
Silver Stars
, 22
Bronze Stars
, and 90 Purple Hearts.
[37]
The 295th Regiment returned on February 20, 1946, from the Panama Canal Zone, and the 296th Regiment on March 6. Both regiments were awarded the American Theater streamer and the Pacific Theater streamer. They were inactivated that same year.
[136]
According to the 4th Report of the Director of Selective Service of 1948, a total of 51,438 Puerto Ricans served in the Armed Forces during World War II, however, the Department of Defense in its report titled "Number of Puerto Ricans serving in the U.S. Armed Forces during National Emergencies" stated that the total of Puerto Ricans who served was 65,034 and from that total 2,560 were listed as wounded.
[88]
Unfortunately, the exact total amount of Puerto Ricans who served in World War II in other units, besides those of Puerto Rico, cannot be determined because the military categorized Hispanics under the same heading as whites. The only racial groups to have separate statistics kept were African-Americans and
Asian Americans
.

Revolt against the United States
[
edit
]
During the mid-1940s, various pro-independence groups, such as the
Puerto Rican Independence Party
, which believed in gaining the island's independence through the electoral process, and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which believed in the concept of armed revolution, existed in Puerto Rico. On October 30, 1950, the nationalists, under the leadership of Dr.
Pedro Albizu Campos
staged uprisings in the towns of
Ponce
, Mayagüez,
Naranjito
, Arecibo,
Utuado
(
Utuado Uprising
), San Juan (
San Juan Nationalist revolt
) and
Jayuya
.
[

The National Guard, commanded by the
Puerto Rico Adjutant General
Major General
Luis R. Esteves
and under the orders of Gov.
Luis Muñoz Marín
, occupy Jayuya
The most notable of these occurred in Jayuya in what became known as
El Grito de Jayuya
(
Jayuya Uprising
). Nationalist leader
Blanca Canales
led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred; one officer was killed and three others were wounded before the rest dropped their weapons and surrendered. The nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the illegal light blue version of the
Puerto Rican Flag
was raised (it was against the law to carry a Puerto Rican Flag from 1898 to 1952.) In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.
[139]
The United States declared
martial law
in Puerto Rico and sent the Puerto Rico National Guard to attack Jayuya. The town was attacked by U.S.
bomber
planes and ground
artillery
. Even though part of the town was destroyed, news of this military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. It was called an incident between Puerto Ricans. The top leaders of the nationalist party, including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, were arrested and sent to jail to serve long prison terms.
[139]
Griselio Torresola
, Albizu Campos's bodyguard, was in the United States at the time of the Jayuya Uprising. Torresola and fellow nationalist
Oscar Collazo
, were to assassinate President
Harry S. Truman
. On November 1, 1950, they attacked the
Blair House
where Torresola and a policeman,
Leslie Coffelt
, lost their lives. Oscar Collazo was arrested and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by President Truman, and he eventually received a presidential pardon.

Cold War (1947-1991)
[
edit
]
After World War II a
geopolitical
,
ideological
, and
economic
struggle emerged between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. Popularly named the
Cold War
, open hostilities never occurred between the main parties involved. Instead it involved a nuclear and conventional weapons arms race, networks of military alliances, economic warfare and trade embargoes, propaganda, espionage, and smaller conflicts. The
Cuban Missile Crisis
of 1962 was the most important direct confrontation. The
Korean
and
Vietnam War
were among the major civil wars polarized along Cold War lines.

Colonel Mihiel Gilormini was named commander of the
198th Fighter Squadron
in Puerto Rico. Gilormini and Colonel Alberto A. Nido, together with Lieutenant Colonel Jose Antonio Muñiz, played an instrumental role in the creation of the
Puerto Rico Air National Guard
on November 23, 1947. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard is a part of the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force.
[142]
Both Gilormini and Nido were eventually promoted to brigadier general and served as commanders of PRANG.  In 1963, the Air National Guard Base, at the San Juan International airport in Puerto Rico, was renamed "Muñiz Air National Guard Base" in honor of Lt. Col. Jose Antonio Muñiz who died on July 4, 1960, when his

The
USS
Cochino
(SS-345)
was a
Gato
-class submarine
under the command of Commander
Rafael Celestino Benítez
. On August 12, 1949, the
Cochino
, along with the
USS
Tusk
(SS-426)
, departed from
Portsmouth
, United Kingdom. Both diesel submarines were supposed to be on a cold-water training mission, however, according to
Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage
,
[144]
the submarines were part of an American intelligence operation. They had
snorkels
that allowed them to spend long periods underwater, largely invisible to an enemy, and they carried electronic gear designed to detect far-off radio signals. The mission of the
Cochino
and the
Tusk
was to eavesdrop on communications that revealed the testing of submarine-launched Soviet missiles that might soon carry
nuclear warheads
; it was the first American undersea spy mission of the Cold War.
[

The mission was cut short when one of the
Cochino

s 4,000-pound batteries caught fire. Benitez directed the firefighting, trying both to save the ship and his crew from the toxic gases. The crew members of the
Tusk
rescued all except one
Cochino
crew member and convinced Benitez, who was the last man on the
Cochino

Cochino
sank off the coast of Norway two minutes after Benitez's departure. Benitez retired from the Navy in 1957 as a rear admiral.

Korean War

Sixty-one thousand Puerto Ricans served in the
Korean War
, including 18,000 Puerto Ricans who enlisted in the
continental United States
.
[89]
On August 26, 1950, the 65th Infantry Regiment departed from Puerto Rico and arrived in Pusan, Korea on September 23, 1950. It was during the long sea voyage that the 65th Infantry was nicknamed the "Borinqueneers". The name is a combination of the words "Borinquen" (the Taíno name for Puerto Rico) and "Buccaneers". Among the hardships suffered by the Puerto Ricans after they arrived in Korea was the lack of warm clothing during the cold, harsh winters. The enemy made many attempts to encircle the regiment, but each time they failed because of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. In December 1950, U.S. Marines found themselves at the
Chosin Reservoir
area. The 65th was part of a task force which enabled the Marines to withdraw from Hangu-Ri.
Company "C" of the 65th Infantry on patrol
In December 1952, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court-martialed, and 91 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass
court martial
of the Korean War. The
Secretary of the Army
Robert T. Stevens
moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though the men who were court-martialed were pardoned in 1954, a campaign was later started to obtain a formal exoneration.
[146]
Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was the Operation "Killer" of January 1951, becoming the first regiment to cross the
Han River
. In April 1951, the regiment participated in the Uijonber Corridor drives and in June 1951, the 65th was the third regiment to cross the Han Ton River. Master Sergeant
Juan E. Negrón
received the Medal of Honor posthumously on March 18, 2014, for his courageous actions while serving as a member of Company L, 65th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division during combat operations against an armed enemy in Kalma-Eri, Korea on April 28, 1951.

The 65th helped push the advance from Ch'orwon towards P'yonggang in June and then assisted in breaking the
Iron Triangle
of Hill 717 in July 1951.
[148]
In late November 1951, the 65th successfully fought off an attack by two battalion-sized enemy units. Colonel Juan César Cordero Dávila was named commander of 65th Infantry on February 1, 1952, thus becoming one of the highest-ranking ethnic officers in the Army.
[149]
Commencing on July 3, 1952, the regiment defended the main line of resistance (MLR) for 47 days and saw action at Cognac, King and Queen with successful attacks on Chinese positions.

In September 1952, the 65th Infantry was holding on to a hill known as Outpost Kelly. Chinese Communist forces that had joined the North Koreans overran the hill in what became known as the
Battle of Outpost Kelly
. The 65th Infantry Regiment launched several efforts to retake the position but was overwhelmed by Chinese artillery and driven off on 24 September.
[150]
In October the regiment also saw action in the Cherwon Sector and on Iron Horse, around Hill 391, which became known as Jackson Heights.
[151]
In June 1953, the 2nd
Battalion
, 65th Infantry Regiment conducted a series of successful raids on Hill 412 in support of a position called Outpost Harry,
[152]
and later the regiment conducted several successful raids in addition to defending defensive positions near the base of the Iron Triangle until the armistice was signed in July.
[153]
The 65th Infantry was credited with battle participation in nine campaigns.
[note 1]
Among the distinctions awarded to the members of the 65th were a Medal of Honor,
[note 2]
10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256
Silver Stars
and 595
Bronze Stars
. According to
El Nuevo Día
newspaper, May 30, 2004, a total of 756 Puerto Ricans lost their lives in Korea and a total of 3,630 men were wounded, from all four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. More than half of these were from the 65th Infantry (not including non-Puerto Ricans). The 65th Infantry returned to Puerto Rico and was deactivated in 1956. However, Major General
Juan César Cordero Dávila
,
Puerto Rico's Adjutant General
(1958-65), persuaded the Department of the Army to transfer the 65th Infantry from the regular Army to the Puerto Rican National Guard. This was the only unit ever transferred from active component Army to the Army Guard.
[146]
Mass court-martial
[
edit
]
After the fighting around Outpost Kelly, Col. Cordero Dávila was relieved of his command by Col. Chester B. DeGavre, a West Point graduate and a "continental" officer from the mainland United States and the officer staff of the 65th was replaced with non-Hispanic officers. DeGavre ordered that the unit stop calling itself the Borinqueneers, cut their special rations of rice and beans, ordered the men to shave off their mustaches and had one of them wear signs that read "I am a coward".
[146]
Throughout October 1952, the 65th's morale declined and casualties around
Jackson Heights
mounted; by early November a patrol from Company L refused to follow their platoon leader across a river in the Chorwon Valley.
[146]
In December 1952, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court-martialed, and 91 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass
court-martial

Secretary of the Army
Robert T. Stevens
moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though the men who were court-martialed were pardoned in 1954, a campaign was later started to obtain a formal exoneration.
[146]
An Army report released in 2001 blamed the breakdown of the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.

The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. On October 22, 1962, Admiral
Horacio Rivero Jr.
was the commander of the American fleet sent by President
John F. Kennedy
to set up a quarantine (blockade) of the Soviet ships. On October 28,
Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev
ordered the removal of the Soviet missiles in Cuba, and Kennedy ordered an end of the quarantine of Cuba on November 20, bringing an end to the crisis.  Rivero later served as U.S. Ambassador to Spain (1972-1975).

On April 14, 1986, in response to acts of terrorism sponsored by
Libyan
leader
Muammar al-Gaddafi
—in particular, the
Berlin disco bombing
of April 6—and against the backdrop of heightened tension and clashes between the Libyan and U.S. Navies over Libya's disputed territorial water claims in the
Gulf of Sidra
, the United States launched a surprise attack on key facilities in
Tripoli
and other parts of Libya. The attack was code-named
Operation El Dorado Canyon

September 11 attacks
[
edit
]
On September 11, 2001,
United Airlines Flight 93
was hijacked by four members of
al-Qaeda
as part of the September 11 attacks. The hijackers' specific target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel
Marc H. Sasseville
and Lieutenant
Heather Penney
. They were given the mission of finding United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it. Since their fighters were not armed with missiles and carrying dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, they might have been required to ram the passenger aircraft. It was not until hours later that they would learn United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the four hijackers.
[172]
In 2001,
Noel Zamot
was assigned to the Directorate of Operations,
United States Space Command
, Paterson Air Force Base in Colorado as Deputy Chief of Operations Integration. According to the United States Air Force, Zamot's mission as Deputy Chief of Operations in the aftermath of the
September 11 attacks
was to integrate emerging national capabilities into a joint counter-terrorism operation.
[173]
He developed concepts for long-term Information Operations and Space Control activities for the US enabling a multi-spectral combat response. He was also involved in the development of the
Special Access Program
(SAP) systems and in the development of new counter-space capabilities which resulted in a more effective counter-terrorism operation across three combat zones.
[173]
When he retired from the Air Force he was commandant of the Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base.

, who was of Puerto Rican descent, was a U.S. Army
combat photographer

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Luis Arturo Mena Irarrázabal
(born 28 August 1979) is a retired
Chilean
professional footballer. He is the only player in Chilean football history to win more than 10 domestic league titles. He also holds more than 300 appearances for Colo-Colo, with seven goals.

The
Roman Empire
[a]
was the post-
Republican
state of
ancient Rome
and is generally understood to mean the period and territory ruled by the
Romans
following
Octavian
's assumption of sole rule under the
Principate
in 31 BC. It included territory in
Europe
,
North Africa
, and
Western Asia
, and was ruled by
emperors
. The
fall of the Western Roman Empire
in 476 conventionally marks the end of
classical antiquity
and the beginning of the
Middle Ages
.
Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond, but became severely destabilized in
civil wars and political conflicts
which culminated in the
victory of Octavian
over
Mark Antony
and
Cleopatra
at the
Battle of Actium
in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of the
Ptolemaic Kingdom
in Egypt. In 27 BC the
Roman Senate
granted Octavian overarching power (
imperium
) and the new title of
Augustus
, marking his
accession as the first Roman emperor
of a
monarchy
with
Rome
as its sole capital. The vast Roman territories were organized in
senatorial
and
imperial
provinces.
The
first two centuries of the Empire
saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the
Pax Romana
(
lit.
'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its
greatest territorial expanse
under
Trajan
(AD 98-117); a period of increasing trouble and decline began under
Commodus
(180-192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a
crisis
that threatened its existence, as the
Gallic
and
Palmyrene
Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of
short-lived emperors
led the Empire. It was reunified under
Aurelian
(
r.
270-275
).
Diocletian
set up two different imperial courts in the
Greek East and Latin West
in 286;
Christians rose to power
in the 4th century following the
Edict of Milan
. The imperial seat moved from Rome to
Byzantium
in 330, renamed
Constantinople
after
Constantine the Great
. The
Migration Period
, involving
large invasions by Germanic peoples
and by the
Huns
of
Attila
, led to the decline of the
Western Roman Empire
. With the
fall of Ravenna
to the
Germanic Herulians
and the
deposition of Romulus Augustus
in 476 by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed. The
Eastern Roman Empire
survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until
the city's fall
in 1453.
[f]
Due to the Empire's extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had
a lasting influence
on the development of
language
,
religion
,
art
,
architecture
,
literature
,
philosophy
,
law
, and
forms of government
in its territories.
Latin
evolved into the
Romance languages
, while
Medieval Greek
became the language of the East. The
Empire's adoption
of
Christianity
led to the formation of medieval
Christendom
. Roman and
Greek art
had a profound impact on the
Italian Renaissance
. Rome's architectural tradition served as the basis for
Romanesque
,
Renaissance
and
Neoclassical architecture
, and influenced
Islamic architecture
. The rediscovery of
classical science
and
technology
(which formed the basis for
Islamic science
) in medieval Europe led to the
Scientific Renaissance
and
Scientific Revolution
. Many modern legal systems, such as the
Napoleonic Code
, descend from Roman law, while Rome's republican institutions have
influenced
the
Italian city-state republics
of the medieval period, the early
United States
, and modern democratic republics.

Transition from Republic to Empire
Further information:
Roman Republic
Augustus of Prima Porta
Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the
Roman Republic
in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Thus, it was an "empire" (a great power) long before it had an emperor.
[20]
The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the
Senate
) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected
magistrates
(
Roman consuls
above all) in conjunction with the Senate.
[21]
The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors.
[22]
[23]
[24]
The consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of
imperium
, meaning "command" (though typically in a military sense).
[25]
Occasionally, successful consuls were given the honorary title
imperator
(commander); this is the origin of the word
emperor
, since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.
[26]
Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and
civil wars
from the late second century BC—
Crisis of the Roman Republic
—while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC,
Julius Caesar
was briefly perpetual
dictator
before being
assassinated
. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the
Battle of Philippi
in 42 BC by
Mark Antony
and Caesar's adopted son
Octavian
. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of Mark Antony and
Cleopatra
at the
Battle of Actium
in 31 BC. In 27 BC the
Senate
made Octavian
princeps
("first citizen") with
proconsular
imperium
, thus beginning the
Principate
(the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the title
Augustus
("the venerated"). Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority.
[27]
Since his rule began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch
de facto
if not
de jure
. During the years of his rule, a new constitutional order emerged (in part organically and in part by design), so that, upon his death, this new constitutional order operated as before when
Tiberius
was accepted as the new emperor.

Marcus Aurelius
(

)
The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the
Pax Romana
("Roman Peace"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down "mercilessly and swiftly".
[28]
The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs. The
Julio-Claudian dynasty
lasted for four more emperors—
Tiberius
,
Caligula
,
Claudius
, and
Nero
—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn
Year of the Four Emperors
, from which
Vespasian
emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief
Flavian dynasty
, followed by the
Nerva-Antonine dynasty
which produced the "
Five Good Emperors
":
Nerva
,
Trajan
,
Hadrian
,
Antoninus Pius
, and
Marcus Aurelius
.

Barbarian kingdoms
and
Byzantine Empire
The
Barbarian Invasions
consisted of the movement of (mainly) ancient
Germanic peoples
into Roman territory. Historically, this event marked the transition between
classical antiquity
and the
Middle Ages
.
In the view of contemporary Greek historian
Cassius Dio
, the accession of
Commodus
in 180 marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron"
[29]
—a comment which has led some historians, notably
Edward Gibbon
, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the
Empire's decline
.
[30]
[31]
In 212, during the reign of
Caracalla
,
Roman citizenship
was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The
Severan dynasty
was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and, following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the
Crisis of the Third Century
, a period of
invasions
,
civil strife
,
economic disorder
, and
plague
.
[32]
In defining
historical epochs
, this crisis sometimes marks the transition from
Classical
to
Late Antiquity
.
Aurelian
(
r.
270-275
) stabilized the empire and
Diocletian
completed the work of fully restoring it in 285, but rejected the role of
princeps
and assumed the title of
dominus
("lord"), thus starting the period known as the
Dominate
.
[33]
Diocletian's reign brought the empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of
Christianity
, the
"Great Persecution"
.
Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate
tetrarch
.
[34]
Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, but the Tetrarchy
collapsed shortly after
. Order was eventually restored by
Constantine the Great
, who became the first emperor to
convert to Christianity
, and who established
Constantinople
as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the
Constantinian
and
Valentinian
dynasties, the empire was divided along an east-west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome.
Julian
, who under the influence of his adviser
Mardonius
attempted to restore
Classical Roman
and
Hellenistic religion
, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors.
Theodosius I
, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 after making Christianity the
state religion
.
[35]
The Roman Empire by 476, noting western and eastern divisions
The
Western Roman Empire
began to
disintegrate
in the early 5th century. The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders, most famously
Attila
,
[36]
but the empire had
assimilated so many Germanic peoples
of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself.
[37]
Most chronologies
place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when
Romulus Augustulus
was
forced to abdicate
to the
Germanic
warlord
Odoacer
.
[38]
[39]
[40]
Odoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring
Zeno
sole emperor and placing himself as Zeno's nominal subordinate. In reality, Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone.
[38]
[39]
[41]
The Eastern Roman Empire, called the
Byzantine Empire
by later historians, continued until the reign of
Constantine XI Palaiologos
. The last Roman emperor died in battle in 1453 against
Mehmed II
and his
Ottoman
forces during the
siege of Constantinople
. Mehmed II adopted the title of
caesar
in an attempt to claim a connection to the Empire.
[42]
Geography and demography
Main articles:
Demography of the Roman Empire
and
Borders of the Roman Empire
Further information:
Classical demography
The Roman Empire was
one of the largest
in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.
[43]
The Latin phrase
imperium sine fine
("empire without end"
[44]
) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In
Virgil
's
Aeneid
,
limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by
Jupiter
.
[45]
This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.
[g]
In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example
cutting down entire forests
.
[47]
Roman expansion
was mostly accomplished under the
Republic
, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia was strengthened. Under
Augustus
, a "global map of the known world" was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive
political geography
that survives from antiquity, the
Geography
of
Strabo
.
[48]
When Augustus died, the account of his achievements
(
Res Gestae
)
prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire.
[49]
Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of
Roman Imperial administration
.
[50]
A segment of the ruins of
Hadrian's Wall

Crag Lough
The Empire reached its largest expanse under
Trajan
(
r.
98-117
),
[51]
encompassing 5 million square kilometres.
[15]
[16]
The traditional population estimate of
55-60 million
inhabitants
[52]
accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population
[53]
and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century.
[54]
Recent
demographic studies
have argued for a population peak from
70 million
to more than
100 million
.
[55]
Each of the three largest cities in the Empire - Rome,
Alexandria
, and
Antioch
- was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century.
[56]
As the historian
Christopher Kelly
described it:
Then the empire stretched from
Hadrian's Wall
in drizzle-soaked
northern England
to the sun-baked banks of the
Euphrates
in Syria; from the great
Rhine
-
Danube
river system, which snaked across the fertile, flat lands of Europe from the
Low Countries
to the
Black Sea
, to the rich plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the
Nile Valley
in Egypt. The empire completely circled the
Mediterranean
... referred to by its conquerors as
mare nostrum
—'our sea'.
[52]
Trajan's successor
Hadrian
adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders
(fines)
were marked, and the frontiers
(
limites
)
patrolled.
[51]
The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable.
[23]
Hadrian's Wall
, which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever-present
barbarian
threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.
[57]
Languages
Main article:
Languages of the Roman Empire
See also:
Jireček Line
Latin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire,
[h]
but the Empire was deliberately multilingual.
[62]
Andrew Wallace-Hadrill
says "The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood".
[63]
At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law.
[64]
Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages.
[65]
Latin and Greek's mutual linguistic and cultural influence is a complex topic.
[66]
Latin words incorporated into Greek were very common by the early imperial era, especially for military, administration, and trade and commerce matters.
[67]
Greek grammar, literature, poetry and philosophy shaped Latin language and culture.
[68]
[69]
A 5th-century
papyrus
showing a parallel Latin-Greek text of a speech by
Cicero
[70]
There was never a legal requirement for Latin in the Empire, but it represented a certain status.
[71]
High standards of Latin,
Latinitas
, started with the advent of Latin literature.
[72]
Due to the flexible language policy of the Empire, a natural competition of language emerged that spurred
Latinitas
, to defend Latin against the stronger cultural influence of Greek.
[73]
Over time Latin usage was used to project power and a higher social class.
[74]
[75]
Different emperors up until Justinian would attempt to require the use of Latin in various sections of the administration but there is no evidence that a linguistic imperialism existed during the early Empire.
[76]
After all freeborn inhabitants were universally
enfranchised
in
212
, many Roman citizens would have lacked a knowledge of Latin.
[77]
The wide use of
Koine Greek
was what enabled the spread of Christianity and reflects its role as the
lingua franca
of the Mediterranean during the time of the Empire.
[78]
Following Diocletian's reforms in the 3rd century CE, there was a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the west.
[79]
Spoken Latin later fragmented into the incipient
romance languages
in the 7th century CE following the collapse of the Empire's west.
[80]
The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscure the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire.
[81]
Latin, referred to in its spoken form as
Vulgar Latin
, gradually replaced
Celtic
and
Italic languages
.
[82]
[83]
References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages, particularly in Egypt with
Coptic
, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman
jurists
also show a concern for local languages such as
Punic
,
Gaulish
, and
Aramaic
in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths.
[84]
In
Africa
, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 2nd century.
[81]
In
Syria
,
Palmyrene
soldiers used their
dialect of Aramaic
for inscriptions, an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.
[85]
The last reference to Gaulish was between 560 and 575.
[86]
[87]
The emergent
Gallo-Romance languages
would then be shaped by Gaulish
[88]
Proto-Basque
or
Aquitanian
evolved with Latin loan words to modern
Basque
.
[89]
The
Thracian language
, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia are attested in Imperial-era inscriptions.

Society
Further information:
Ancient Roman society
A multigenerational banquet depicted on a wall painting from
Pompeii
(1st century AD)
The Empire was remarkably multicultural, with "astonishing cohesive capacity" to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples.
[91]
Public monuments and communal spaces open to all—such as
forums
,
amphitheatres
,
racetracks
and
baths
—helped foster a sense of "Romanness".
[92]
Roman society had multiple, overlapping
social hierarchies
.
[93]
The civil war preceding Augustus caused upheaval,
[94]
but did not effect an immediate
redistribution of wealth
and social power. From the perspective of the lower classes, a peak was merely added to the social pyramid.
[95]
Personal relationships—
patronage
, friendship
(amicitia)
,
family
,
marriage
—continued to influence politics.
[96]
By the time of
Nero
, however, it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen, or an
equestrian
who exercised greater power than a senator.
[97]
The blurring of the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased
social mobility
,
[98]
both upward and downward, to a greater extent than all other well-documented ancient societies.
[99]
Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them.
[100]
Social life, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of
voluntary associations
and
confraternities
(
collegia
and
sodalitates
): professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs,
[101]
performing troupes,
[102]
and
burial societies
.
[103]
Legal status
Main articles:
Status in Roman legal system
and
Roman citizenship
According to the
jurist Gaius
, the essential distinction in the Roman "
law of persons
" was that all humans were either free
(liberi)
or slaves
(servi)
.
[104]
The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the
ius Latinum
,
"Latin right"), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were
peregrini
, non-Romans.
[105]
In 212, the
Constitutio Antoniniana
extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.

Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase
ex duobus civibus Romanis natos
("children born of two Roman citizens").
[i]
A Roman woman kept her own
family name
(nomen)
for life. Children most often took the father's name, with some exceptions.
[109]
Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business.
[110]
Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes.

in which the woman was subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated.
[112]
This arrangement was a factor in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed compared to many other cultures up to the modern period:
[113]
although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in daily life,
[114]
and her husband had no legal power over her.
[115]
Although it was a point of pride to be a "one-man woman"
(univira)
who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to
divorce
, nor to speedy remarriage after being widowed or divorced.
[116]
Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.
[117]
A mother's right to own and dispose of property, including setting the terms of her will, gave her enormous influence over her sons into adulthood.

As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order,
moral legislation
attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting "
family values
".
Adultery
was criminalized,
[119]
and defined broadly as an illicit sex act
(
stuprum
)
between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is, a
double standard
was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status.
[120]
Childbearing was encouraged: a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom (the
ius trium liberorum
)
.
Slaves and the law
Main article:
Slavery in ancient Rome
At the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in
Roman Italy
were slaves,
[121]
making Rome one of five historical "slave societies" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy.
[j]
[121]
Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility.
[122]
In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour.
Agriculture
and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in
Roman Egypt
but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces.
[123]
Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy.
[124]

relief
from a 4th-century sarcophagus)
Laws pertaining to slavery were "extremely intricate".
[125]
Slaves were considered property and had no
legal personhood
. They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens,
sexual exploitation
, torture, and
summary execution
. A slave could not as a matter of law be raped; a slave's rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the
Aquilian Law
.
[126]
Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called
conubium
, but their unions were sometimes recognized.
[127]
Technically, a slave could not own property,
[128]
but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund
(peculium)
that he could use, depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave.
[129]
Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave acting as the master of others.
[130]
Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough
peculium
to justify their freedom, or be
manumitted
for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law
(
Lex Fufia Caninia
)
limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.
[131]
Following the
Servile Wars
of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves.
[132]
Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as
prostitutes in ancient Rome
were often slaves.
[133]
The burgeoning trade in
eunuchs
in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the
castration
of a slave against his will "for lust or gain."
[134]
Roman slavery was not based on
race
.
[135]
Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians,
[136]
with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Foreign slaves had higher mortality and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions.
[137]
The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).
[138]
During the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the
conquest of Greece
brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves. Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by
pirates
.
Infant abandonment
and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources.
[139]
Vernae
, by contrast, were "homegrown" slaves born to female slaves within the household, estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his
vernae
faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.
[140]
Freedmen
Cinerary urn

Rome differed from
Greek city-states
in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom
(libertas)
, including the right to vote.
[141]
His former master became his patron
(
patronus
)
: the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other.
[142]
[143]
A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a
priestly role
. He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that
Hadrian
limited their participation by law.
[143]
The rise of successful freedmen—through political influence or wealth—is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by
inscriptions throughout the Empire
, and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at
Pompeii
.
Census rank
See also:
Senate of the Roman Empire
,
Equestrian order
, and
Decurion (administrative)
The Latin word
ordo
(plural
ordines
) is translated variously and inexactly into English as "class, order, rank". One purpose of the
Roman census
was to determine the
ordo
to which an individual belonged. The two highest
ordines
in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian. Outside Rome, the
decurions
, also known as
curiales
, were the top governing
ordo
of an individual city.
Fragment of a sarcophagus depicting
Gordian III
and senators (3rd century)
"Senator" was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an
executive magistrate
. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million
sestertii
.
[144]
Not all men who qualified for the
ordo senatorius
chose to take a Senate seat, which required
legal domicile
at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment.
[145]
A senator's son belonged to the
ordo senatorius
, but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards.
[146]
In the time of Nero, senators were still primarily from
Italy
, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian.
[147]
The first senator from the easternmost province,
Cappadocia
, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius.
[k]
By the
Severan dynasty
(193-235), Italians made up less than half the Senate.
[149]
During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland
(patria)
.
[146]
Senators were the traditional governing class who rose through the
cursus honorum
, the political career track, but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome's early days,
equites
or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors, but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire.
[l]
A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian.
[151]
The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at
Cadiz
and
Padua
alone.
[m]
[153]
Equestrians rose through a military career track
(
tres militiae
)
to become highly placed
prefects
and
procurators
within the Imperial administration.
[154]
The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later
European nobility
, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands.
[155]
Admission to the higher
ordines
brought distinction and privileges, but also responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services
(
munera
)
. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures.
[156]
Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.
[157]
In the later Empire, the
dignitas
("worth, esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as
vir illustris
("illustrious man").
[158]
The appellation
clarissimus
(Greek
lamprotatos
) was used to designate the
dignitas
of certain senators and their immediate family, including women.
[159]
"Grades" of equestrian status proliferated.
[160]
Unequal justice
Condemned man attacked by a leopard in the arena (3rd-century mosaic from Tunisia)
As the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours
(honestiores)
and humbler folk
(humiliores)
. In general,
honestiores
were the members of the three higher "orders," along with certain military officers.
[161]
The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system.
[162]
Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative "worth"
(dignitas)
of the defendant: an
honestior
could pay a fine for a crime for which an
humilior
might receive a
scourging
.
[163]
Execution, which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic,
[164]
could be quick and relatively painless for
honestiores
, while
humiliores
might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves, such as
crucifixion
and
condemnation to the beasts
.
[165]
In the early Empire, those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as
honestiores
, especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities, and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of
martyrdom
.
[166]

The three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government.
[167]
The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites.
[168]
The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone.
Cooperation with local elites
was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions.
[169]
Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance.
[170]
Roman government was thus
limited
, but efficient in its use of available resources.
[171]
Central government

The
Imperial cult of ancient Rome
identified
emperors
and some members of their families with
divinely sanctioned
authority (
auctoritas
). The rite of
apotheosis
(also called
consecratio
) signified the deceased emperor's deification.
[172]
The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices.
[173]
The emperor made himself the central religious authority as
pontifex maximus
, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders.
[174]
While these functions were clearly defined during the
Principate
, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the
Dominate
.
[175]
The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate, he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually.
[176]
The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen.
[177]
After Nero, the influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council
(consilium)
became subject to official appointment for greater
transparency
.
[178]
Though the Senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the
Antonine dynasty
, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the
consilium.
[179]
The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions.
[180]
Access to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception
(salutatio)
, a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at
games
.
[181]
By the 4th century, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.
[182]
Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it retained its symbolic political centrality.
[183]
The Senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor employed senators as legates
(
legati
)
: generals, diplomats, and administrators.
[184]
The practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military. The
legionaries
were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual
oath of loyalty
to the emperor.
[185]
Most emperors chose a successor, usually a close family member or
adopted
heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the
Praetorian Guard
and the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the
donativum
, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.

and
Structural history of the Roman military
After the
Punic Wars
, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of
conscript citizens
defended the homeland against a specific threat. The Romans expanded their war machine by "organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army."
[187]
By Imperial times, military service was a full-time career.
[188]
The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of
Romanization
.
[189]
The primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the
Pax Romana
.
[190]
The three major divisions of the military were:
the garrison at Rome, comprising the
Praetorian Guard
, the
cohortes urbanae
and the
vigiles
, who functioned as police and firefighters;
the provincial army, comprising the
Roman legions
and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces
(
auxilia
);
the
navy
.

Trajan's Column

Through his military reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus regularized the legion. A legion was organized into ten
cohorts
, each of which comprised six
centuries
, with a century further made up of ten squads
(
contubernia
)
; the exact size of the Imperial legion, which was likely determined by
logistics
, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.
[191]
After Germanic tribes wiped out three legions in the
Battle of the Teutoburg Forest
in 9 AD, the number of legions was increased from 25 to around 30.
[192]
The army had about 300,000 soldiers in the 1st century, and under 400,000 in the 2nd, "significantly smaller" than the collective armed forces of the conquered territories. No more than 2% of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army.
[193]
Augustus also created the
Praetorian Guard
: nine cohorts, ostensibly to maintain the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians served only sixteen years.
[194]
The
auxilia
were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with
Roman citizenship
, also extended to their sons. According to
Tacitus
[195]
there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries—thus, around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments.
[196]
The
Roman cavalry
of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts.
[197]
The
Roman navy
not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the
frontiers
along the rivers
Rhine
and
Danube
. Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates. It patrolled the Mediterranean, parts of the
North Atlantic
coasts, and the
Black Sea
. Nevertheless, the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.
[198]
Provincial government
An annexed territory became a
Roman province
in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land.
[199]
Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings.
[200]
In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy.
[21]
Among these officials were the
Roman governors
:
magistrates elected at Rome
who in the name of the
Roman people
governed
senatorial provinces
; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their
imperium
on behalf of the emperor in
imperial provinces
, most notably
Roman Egypt
.
[201]
A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties.
[202]
His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants
(
apparitores
)
, including
lictors
, heralds, messengers,
scribes
, and bodyguards;
legates
, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends who accompanied him unofficially.
[202]
Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances.
[21]
Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era, to avoid provincial governors and
tax farmers
exploiting local populations for personal gain.
[203]
Equestrian
procurators
, whose authority was originally "extra-judicial and extra-constitutional," managed both state-owned property and the personal property of the emperor
(
res privata
)
.
[202]
Because Roman government officials were few, a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity.

Roman courts held
original jurisdiction
over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures.
[94]
Generally, it was Roman policy to respect the
mos regionis
("regional tradition" or "law of the land") and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability.
[94]
[205]
The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying
ius gentium
, the "law of nations" or
international law
regarded as common and customary.
[206]
If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard
appeals
, and the emperor held final decision-making authority.
[94]
[205]
[n]
In the West, law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis, and
private property rights
may have been a novelty of the Roman era, particularly among
Celts
. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite.
[94]
The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law, replacing local law codes that had applied to non-citizens. Diocletian's efforts to stabilize the Empire after the
Crisis of the Third Century
included two major compilations of law in four years, the
Codex Gregorianus
and the
Codex Hermogenianus
, to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.
[207]
The pervasiveness of Roman law throughout Western Europe enormously influenced the Western legal tradition, reflected by continued use of
Latin legal terminology
in modern law.
Taxation
Further information:
Taxation in ancient Rome
The
Temple of Saturn
, a religious monument that housed the treasury in ancient Rome
Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its
gross product
.
[208]
The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5%.
[209]
The tax code was "bewildering" in its complicated system of
direct
and
indirect taxes
, some paid in cash and some
in kind
. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as
fisheries
; they might be temporary.
[210]
Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military,
[211]
and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.
[212]
In-kind taxes were accepted from less-
monetized
areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.
[213]
The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a
poll tax
and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.
[209]
Tax obligations were determined by the census: each head of household provided a headcount of his household, as well as an accounting of his property.
[214]
A major source of indirect-tax revenue was the
portoria
, customs and tolls on trade, including among provinces.
[209]
Towards the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4% tax on the sale of slaves,
[215]
which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices.
[216]
An owner who manumitted a slave paid a "freedom tax", calculated at 5% of value.
[o]
An
inheritance tax
of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone outside their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from an auction tax went towards the veterans' pension fund
(
aerarium militare
)
.
[209]
Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the "super-rich", but in the later period, the
resistance
of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.

Economy

Roman economy

The Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of "political capitalism" in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues.
[217]
Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to
industrialization
.
[218]
Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of
land use
that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa.
[219]
Some cities were known for particular industries. The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry.
[219]
Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of
economic rationalism
,
[219]
and the Empire was highly monetized.
[220]
Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies.
[221]
The
supply contracts for the army
drew on local suppliers near the base
(
castrum
)
, throughout the province, and across provincial borders.
[222]
Economic historians
vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate.
[223]
In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380
HS
. The GDP per capita of
Italy
is estimated as 40
[224]
to 66%
[225]
higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income.
Economic dynamism resulted in social mobility. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, wealth requirements for
rank
indicate a strong tendency towards
plutocracy
. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in grand estates or townhouses, luxury items,
public entertainments
, funerary monuments, and
religious dedications
. Guilds
(
collegia
)
and corporations
(corpora)
provided support for individuals to succeed through networking.
[161]
"There can be little doubt that the lower classes of ... provincial towns of the Roman Empire enjoyed a high
standard of living
not equaled again in Western Europe until the 19th century".
[226]
Households in the top 1.5% of
income distribution
captured about 20% of income. The "vast majority" produced more than half of the total income, but lived near
subsistence
.

.
[229]
The
sestertius

) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century,
[230]
though the silver

, worth four sesterces, was also used beginning in the
Severan dynasty
.
[231]
The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze

.
[232]
Bullion
and
ingots
seem not to have counted as
pecunia
("money") and were used only on the frontiers. Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face. This tendency towards
fiat money
led to the
debasement
of Roman coinage in the later Empire.
[233]
The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration.
[229]
The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the
money supply
for trading or saving.
[234]
Rome had no
central bank
, and regulation of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept
less in reserves
than the full total of customers' deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited
capital
, and often only one principal.
Seneca
assumes that anyone involved in
Roman commerce
needs access to
credit
.
[233]
A professional
deposit
banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers.
[235]
The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked
documentary transactions
, the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, in 33 AD;
[236]
generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers.
[233]
The central government itself did not borrow money, and without
public debt
had to fund
deficits
from cash reserves.
[237]
Emperors of the
Antonine
and
Severan
dynasties debased the currency, particularly the
denarius
, under the pressures of meeting military payrolls.
[230]
Sudden inflation under
Commodus
damaged the credit market.
[233]
In the mid-200s, the supply of
specie
contracted sharply.
[230]
Conditions during the
Crisis of the Third Century
—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector.
[230]
[233]
Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or
fiduciary currency
, general economic anxieties came to a head under
Aurelian
, and bankers lost confidence in coins. Despite
Diocletian
's introduction of the gold
solidus
and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.

Mining and metallurgy
Main articles:
Mining in ancient Rome
and
Roman metallurgy
Landscape resulting from the
ruina montium
mining technique at
Las Médulas
, Spain, one of the most important gold mines in the Roman Empire
The main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the
Danubian provinces
(gold, iron);
Macedonia
and
Thrace
(gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive large-scale mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of
open-cast mining
and
underground mining
—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production.
Hydraulic mining
allowed
base
and
precious metals
to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale.
[238]
The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500
tonnes
.
[239]
Copper and lead production levels were unmatched until the
Industrial Revolution
.
[240]
[241]
[242]
[243]
At its peak around the mid-2nd century, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000 t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of
medieval Europe
and the
Caliphate
around 800 AD.
[242]
[244]
As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the
Greenland ice sheet
quadrupled over prehistoric levels during the Imperial era and dropped thereafter.
[245]
Transportation and communication
Further information:
Cursus publicus
The
Tabula Peutingeriana
(
Latin
for "The Peutinger Map") an
Itinerarium
, often assumed to be based on the Roman
cursus publicus
The Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called "our sea"
(
mare nostrum
)
.
[246]
Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers.
[56]
Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult.
[247]
Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers.
[248]
Land transport utilized the advanced system of
Roman roads
, called "
viae
". These roads were primarily built for military purposes,
[249]
but also served commercial ends. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel, animals, or vehicles for the
cursus publicus
, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus.
[213]
Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve
Roman miles
, and tended to grow into villages or trading posts.
[250]
A
mansio
(plural
mansiones
) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the
cursus publicus
. The distance between
mansiones
was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day.
[250]
Carts were usually pulled by mules, travelling about 4 mph.
[251]
Trade and commodities
See also:
Roman commerce
,
Indo-Roman trade relations
, and
Sino-Roman relations
Roman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as
China
and
India
.
[252]
Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the
Silk Road
; Indian trade also occurred by sea from
Egyptian
ports. The main
commodity
was grain.
[253]
Also traded were olive oil, foodstuffs,
garum
(
fish sauce
), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber,
pottery
,
glassware
, marble,
papyrus
, spices and
materia medica
, ivory, pearls, and gemstones.
[254]
Though most provinces could produce wine,
regional varietals
were desirable and wine was a central trade good.
[255]
Labour and occupations
Workers at a cloth-processing shop, in a painting from the
fullonica
of Veranius Hypsaeus in Pompeii
Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii.
[193]
Professional associations or trade guilds
(collegia)
are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized.
[161]
Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs;
imperial or public service
; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal.
[256]
In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free,
[94]
and most workers were illiterate and without special skills.
[257]
The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in Italian industrial farming
(
latifundia
)
, these may have been mostly slaves, but elsewhere slave farm labour was probably less important.
[94]
Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded and products were often named for peoples or towns, like a
fashion "label"
.
[258]
Better ready-to-wear was exported by local businessmen (
negotiatores
or
mercatores
).
[259]
Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, by
vestiarii
(clothing dealers), or peddled by itinerant merchants.
[259]
The
fullers
(
fullones
) and dye workers (
coloratores
) had their own guilds.
[260]
Centonarii
were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into
pieced goods
.

Architecture and engineering

The Flavian Amphitheatre, more commonly known as the
Colosseum
The chief
Roman contributions to architecture
were the
arch
,
vault
and
dome
. Some Roman structures still stand today, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and
concrete
.
[263]
Roman temples
developed
Etruscan
and Greek forms, with some distinctive elements.
Roman roads
are considered the most advanced built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade, and were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Some remained usable for over a thousand years.
Roman bridges
were among the first large and lasting bridges, built from stone (and in most cases concrete) with the arch as the basic structure. The largest Roman bridge was
Trajan's bridge
over the lower Danube, constructed by
Apollodorus of Damascus
, which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built.
[264]
The Romans built many
dams and reservoirs
for water collection, such as the
Subiaco Dams
, two of which fed the
Anio Novus
, one of the largest aqueducts of Rome.
[265]
The
Pont du Gard
aqueduct, which crosses the river
Gardon
in southern France, is on
UNESCO
's list of
World Heritage Sites
.
The Romans constructed numerous
aqueducts
.
De aquaeductu
, a treatise by
Frontinus
, who served as
water commissioner
, reflects the administrative importance placed on the water supply. Masonry channels carried water along a precise
gradient
, using
gravity
alone. It was then collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains, baths,
toilets
, or industrial sites.
[266]
The main aqueducts in Rome were the
Aqua Claudia
and the
Aqua Marcia
.
[267]
The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a route of more than 336 km.
[268]
Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine
tolerance
, and to a technological standard not equalled until modern times.
[269]
The Romans also used aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire.
[270]
Insulated glazing
(or "double glazing") was used in the construction of
public baths
. Elite housing in cooler climates might have
hypocausts
, a form of central heating. The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later
steam engine
: the crank and connecting rod system,
Hero
's
aeolipile
(generating steam power), the
cylinder
and
piston
(in metal force pumps), non-return
valves
(in water pumps), and
gearing
(in water mills and clocks).

Cityscape

(60s AD)
City and country
The city was viewed as fostering civilization by being "properly designed, ordered, and adorned."
[272]
Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and
reorganized the city
into neighbourhoods
(
vici
)
administered at the local level with police and firefighting services.
[273]
A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the
Campus Martius
, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace (
Ara Pacis Augustae
) was located there, as was
an obelisk
imported from Egypt that formed the pointer
(
gnomon
)
of a
horologium
. With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit.
[273]
City planning and urban lifestyles was influenced by the Greeks early on,
[274]
and in the Eastern Empire, Roman rule shaped the development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as
Athens
,
Aphrodisias
,
Ephesus
and
Gerasa
tailored city planning and architecture to imperial ideals, while expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence.
[275]
In areas inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of preexisting walled settlements known as
oppida
.
[276]
[277]
[q]
Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic coastal cities.
[250]
Aquae Sulis

, England: architectural features above the level of the pillar bases are a later reconstruction.
The network of cities (
coloniae
,
municipia
,
civitates
or in Greek terms
poleis
) was a primary cohesive force during the Pax Romana.
[182]
Romans of the 1st and 2nd centuries were encouraged to "inculcate the habits of peacetime".
[279]
As the classicist
Clifford Ando
noted:
Most of the cultural
appurtenances
popularly associated with imperial culture—
public cult
and its
games
and
civic banquets
, competitions for artists, speakers, and athletes, as well as the funding of the great majority of public buildings and public display of art—were financed by private individuals, whose expenditures in this regard helped to justify their economic power and legal and provincial privileges.
[280]
Public toilets
(latrinae)
from
Ostia Antica
In the city of Rome, most people lived in multistory apartment buildings
(
insulae
)
that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths
(
thermae
)
, toilets with running water
(latrinae)
, basins or elaborate fountains
(
nymphea
)
delivering fresh water,
[277]
and large-scale entertainments such as
chariot races
and
gladiator combat
—were aimed primarily at the common people.
[281]
Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.
The public baths served hygienic, social and cultural functions.
[282]
Bathing was the focus of daily socializing.
[283]
Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures, with amenities that might include an
exercise room
,
sauna
,
exfoliation
spa,
ball court
, or outdoor swimming pool. Baths had
hypocaust
heating: the floors were suspended over hot-air channels.
[284]
Public baths were part of urban culture
throughout the provinces
, but in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing. Christians were advised to go to the baths only for hygiene.
[285]
Reconstructed peristyle garden based on the
House of the Vettii
Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses: a townhouse
(
domus
) and at least one luxury home
(
villa
)
outside the city. The
domus
was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath
(balneum)
[284]
but it was not a place to retreat from public life.
[286]
Although some neighbourhoods show a higher concentration of such houses, they were not segregated enclaves. The
domus
was meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the
paterfamilias
(head of household) met with
clients
every morning.
[273]
It was a centre of family religious rites, containing a
shrine
and
images of family ancestors
.
[287]
The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces were often rented out as shops
(
tabernae
)
.
[288]
In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the
insulae
—townhouses typically enclosed a
peristyle
garden.
[289]
The villa by contrast was an escape from the city, and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances intellectual and artistic interests
(
otium
)
with an appreciation of nature and agriculture.
[290]
Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design.
[291]
It might be located on a working estate, or in a "resort town" on the seacoast.
Augustus' programme of urban renewal, and the growth of Rome's population to as many as one million, was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life. Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds. Interior decorating often featured painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament,
[291]
and animals, rendered accurately enough to be identified by species.
[292]
On a more practical level, the central government took an active interest in supporting
agriculture
.
[293]
Producing food was the priority of land use.
[294]
Larger farms
(
latifundia
)
achieved an
economy of scale
that sustained urban life.
[293]
Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as
crop rotation
and
selective breeding
were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another.
[295]
Bread stall, from a Pompeiian wall painting
Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (
Cura Annonae
) to citizens who registered for it
[293]
(about 200,000-250,000 adult males in Rome).
[296]
The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues,
[293]
but improved living conditions among the lower classes,
[297]
and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on estates.
[293]
The grain dole also had symbolic value: it affirmed the emperor's position as universal benefactor, and the right of citizens to share in "the fruits of conquest".
[293]
The
annona
, public facilities, and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lower-class Romans, and kept social unrest in check. The satirist
Juvenal
, however, saw "
bread and circuses
"
(panem et circenses)
as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty:
[298]
The public has long since cast off its cares: the people that once bestowed commands, consulships, legions and all else, now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things: bread and circuses.
[299]
Health and disease
Further information:
Disease in Imperial Rome
,
Antonine plague
, and
Plague of Cyprian
Epidemics
were common in the ancient world, and occasional
pandemics
in the Empire killed millions. The Roman population was unhealthy. About 20 percent—a large percentage by ancient standards—lived in cities, Rome being the largest. The cities were a "demographic sink": the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population. Average lifespan is estimated at the mid-twenties, and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood. Dense urban populations and
poor sanitation
contributed to disease. Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empire's territories. The rich were not immune; only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius's fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood.
[300]
The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as
Galen
(2nd century). Views on nutrition were influenced by beliefs like
humoral theory
.
[301]
A good indicator of nutrition and disease burden is average height: the average Roman was shorter in stature than the population of pre-Roman Italian societies and medieval Europe.

Most apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal
brazier
could be used for rudimentary cookery.
[303]
Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls
(
tabernae
, cauponae,
popinae
,
thermopolia
)
.
[304]
Carryout
and restaurants were for the lower classes;
fine dining
appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a
chef
(archimagirus)
and kitchen staff,
[305]
or banquets hosted by social clubs
(
collegia
)
.
[306]
Most Romans consumed at least 70% of their daily
calories
in the form of cereals and
legumes
.
[307]
Puls
(pottage) was considered the food of the Romans,
[308]
and could be elaborated to produce dishes similar to
polenta
or
risotto
.
[309]
Urban populations and the military preferred bread.
[307]
By the reign of
Aurelian
, the state had begun to distribute the
annona
as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added
olive oil
, wine, and pork to the dole.
[310]
Roman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes,
[311]
for whom the evening meal
(
cena
)
had important social functions.
[312]
Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room
(
triclinium
)
furnished with couches. By the late Republic, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.
[313]
The poet Martial describes a dinner, beginning with the
gustatio
("tasting" or "appetizer") salad. The main course was
kid
, beans, greens, a chicken, and leftover ham, followed by a dessert of fruit and wine.
[314]
Roman "
foodies
" indulged in
wild game
,
fowl
such as
peacock
and
flamingo
, large fish (
mullet
was especially prized), and
shellfish
. Luxury ingredients were imported from the far reaches of empire.
[315]
A book-length collection of Roman recipes is attributed to
Apicius
, a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with "
gourmet
."
[316]
Refined cuisine could be moralized as a sign of either civilized progress or decadent decline.
[317]
Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—were considered more civilized foods than meat. The
Mediterranean staples
of
bread
,
wine
, and
oil
were
sacralized
by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of
paganism
.
[318]
Some philosophers and Christians resisted the demands of the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted
fasting
as an ideal.
[319]
Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished and trade routes were disrupted;
[320]
the Church formally discouraged
gluttony
,
[321]
and hunting and
pastoralism
were seen as simple and virtuous.
[320]
Spectacles

A victor in his
four-horse chariot
When
Juvenal
complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for "bread and circuses", he was referring to the state-provided grain dole and the
circenses
, events held in the entertainment venue called a
circus
. The largest such venue in Rome was the
Circus Maximus
, the setting of
horse races
,
chariot races
, the equestrian
Troy Game
, staged beast hunts
(
venationes
)
, athletic contests,
gladiator combat
, and
historical re-enactments
. From earliest times, several
religious festivals
had featured games
(
ludi
)
, primarily horse and chariot races
(ludi circenses)
.
[322]
The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture,
initiation
, and the cycle of birth and death.
[r]
Under Augustus, public entertainments were presented on 77 days of the year; by the reign of Marcus Aurelius, this had expanded to 135.
[324]
Circus games were preceded by an elaborate parade (
pompa circensis
) that ended at the venue.
[325]
Competitive events were held also in smaller venues such as the
amphitheatre
, which became the characteristic Roman spectacle venue, and stadium. Greek-style athletics included
footraces
,
boxing
,
wrestling
, and the
pancratium
.
[326]
Aquatic displays, such as the mock sea battle
(
naumachia
)
and a form of "water ballet", were presented in engineered pools.
[327]
State-supported
theatrical events
(
ludi scaenici
)
took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres, or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an
odeon
.
[328]
Circuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world.
[329]
The Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the
Colosseum
, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome.
[330]
Many
Roman amphitheatres
,
circuses
and
theatres
built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today.
[330]
The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events, which both enhanced their status and drained their resources.
[165]
The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor in his opulent box; senators and equestrians in reserved advantageous seats; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else in-between.
[331]
The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites of social and political protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the
Nika riots
in 532.
[332]
The
Zliten mosaic
, from a dining room in present-day Libya, depicts a series of arena scenes: from top, musicians; gladiators;
beast fighters
; and convicts
condemned to the beasts
[333]
The chariot teams were known by the
colours they wore
. Fan loyalty was fierce and at times erupted into
sports riots
.
[334]
Racing was perilous, but charioteers were among the most celebrated and well-compensated athletes.
[335]
Circuses were designed to ensure that no team had an unfair advantage and to minimize collisions (
naufragia
),
[336]
which were nonetheless frequent and satisfying to the crowd.
[337]
The races retained a magical aura through their early association with
chthonic
rituals: circus images were considered protective or lucky,
curse tablets
have been found buried at the site of racetracks, and charioteers were often suspected of sorcery.
[338]
Chariot racing continued into the Byzantine period under imperial sponsorship, but the decline of cities in the 6th and 7th centuries led to its eventual demise.
[329]
The Romans thought gladiator contests had originated with
funeral games
and
sacrifices
. Some of the earliest
styles of gladiator fighting
had ethnic designations such as "
Thracian
" or "Gallic".
[339]
The staged combats were considered
munera
, "services, offerings, benefactions", initially distinct from the festival games
(ludi)
.
[340]
To mark the opening of the Colosseum,
Titus
presented
100 days of arena events
, with 3,000 gladiators competing on a single day.
[341]
Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, lamps, and in graffiti.
[342]
Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves, convicts, or free volunteers.
[343]
Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training was costly and time-consuming.
[344]
By contrast,
noxii
were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or no training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival; physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate
retributive justice
.
[165]
These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of
myths
, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate
stage machinery
to create special effects.
[165]
[345]
Modern scholars have found the pleasure Romans took in the "theatre of life and death"
[346]
difficult to understand.
[347]
Pliny the Younger
rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people, "to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory".
[348]
Some Romans such as
Seneca
were critical of the brutal spectacles, but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighter
[349]
—an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the
Christians martyred
in the arena. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of
human sacrifice
.
[350]
Even
martyr literature
, however, offers "detailed, indeed luxuriant, descriptions of bodily suffering",
[351]
and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction.
[352]
Recreation

The singular
ludus
, "play, game, sport, training," had a wide range of meanings such as "word play," "theatrical performance," "board game," "primary school," and even "gladiator training school" (as in
Ludus Magnus
).
[353]
Activities for children and young people in the Empire included
hoop rolling
and
knucklebones
(
astragali
or "jacks"). Girls had
dolls
made of wood,
terracotta
, and especially
bone and ivory
.
[354]
Ball games include
trigon
and
harpastum
.
[355]
People of all ages played
board games
, including
latrunculi
("Raiders") and
XII scripta
("Twelve Marks").
[356]
A game referred to as
alea
(dice) or

originally was an exercise field where young men learned horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to
Plutarch
, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned
Nero's efforts to encourage Greek-style athletic games
.
[358]
Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers, and a rare few as
female gladiators
. The "Bikini Girls" mosaic shows young women engaging in routines comparable to
rhythmic gymnastics
.
[s]
[360]
Women were encouraged to maintain health through activities such as playing ball, swimming, walking, or reading aloud (as a breathing exercise).

Togate statue in the
Museo Archeologico Nazionale d'Abruzzo
In a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer.
[362]
Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order.
[363]
There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles are rare.
[364]
[365]
The
toga
was the distinctive national garment of the male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political or court business and religious rites.
[366]
[364]
It was a "vast expanse" of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance.
[366]
The drapery became more intricate and structured over time.
[367]
The
toga praetexta
, with a
purple or purplish-red
stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age,
curule magistrates
, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga
(toga picta)
.
[368]
Ordinary clothing was dark or colourful. The basic garment for all Romans, regardless of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved
tunic
, with length differing by wearer.
[369]
The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades; finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man of the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes
(clavi)
woven vertically: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status.
[369]
Other garments could be layered over the tunic. Common male attire also included cloaks and in some regions
trousers
.
[370]
In the 2nd century, emperors and elite men are often portrayed wearing the
pallium
, an originally Greek mantle; women are also portrayed in the pallium.
Tertullian
considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, in contrast to the toga, and for educated people.
[363]
[364]
[371]
Roman clothing styles changed over time.
[372]
In the
Dominate
, clothing worn by both soldiers and bureaucrats became highly decorated with geometrical patterns, stylized plant motifs, and in more elaborate examples, human or animal figures.
[373]
Courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society, and the waning of urban life, affected fashion: heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, and the toga was abandoned,
[374]
replaced by the pallium as a garment embodying social unity.

, domestic use, and commerce.
[378]
The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and

Despite the value placed on art, even famous artists were of low social status, partly as they worked with their hands.

Two portraits

Antinous Mondragone
Portraiture, which survives mainly in sculpture, was the most copious form of imperial art. Portraits during the Augustan period utilize
classical proportions
, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism.
[381]
Republican portraits were characterized by
verism
, but as early as the 2nd century BC, Greek
heroic nudity
was adopted for conquering generals.
[382]
Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or semi-nude body with perfect musculature.
[383]
Clothed in the toga or military regalia, the body communicates rank or role, not individual characteristics.
[384]
Women of the emperor's family were often depicted as goddesses or divine personifications.
Portraiture in painting is represented primarily by the
Fayum mummy portraits
, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with realistic painting. Marble portrait sculpture were painted, but traces have rarely survived.

Examples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly, though often in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statuary in marble, bronze and

, and
reliefs
from public buildings and monuments. Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues,
[386]
[387]
as were
formal gardens
.
[388]
Temples housed cult images of deities, often by famed sculptors.
[389]
Elaborately carved marble and limestone
sarcophagi
are characteristic of the 2nd to 4th centuries.
[390]
Sarcophagus relief has been called the "richest single source of Roman iconography,"
[391]
depicting
mythological scenes
[392]
or Jewish/Christian imagery
[393]
as well as the deceased's life.
Painting
Initial Roman painting drew from
Etruscan
and
Greek
models and techniques. Examples of Roman paintings can be found in
palaces
,
catacombs
and
villas
. Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes, particularly as preserved by the
eruption of Vesuvius
. In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs, wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre, landscapes and gardens,
spectacles
, everyday life, and
erotic art
.

Mosaics
are among the most enduring of Roman
decorative arts
, and are found on floors and other architectural features. The most common is the
tessellated mosaic
, formed from uniform pieces
(
tesserae
)
of materials such as stone and glass.
[395]
Opus sectile
is a related technique in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed. This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century (eg the
Basilica of Junius Bassus
).
[396]
Figurative
mosaics share many themes with painting, and in some cases use almost identical
compositions
. Geometric patterns and mythological scenes occur throughout the Empire. In North Africa, a particularly rich source of mosaics, homeowners often chose scenes of life on their estates, hunting, agriculture, and local wildlife.
[394]
Plentiful and major examples of Roman mosaics come also from present-day Turkey (particularly the (
Antioch mosaics
[397]
), Italy, southern France, Spain, and Portugal.
Decorative arts

Decorative arts
for luxury consumers included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. Pottery manufacturing was economically important, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery
(
terra sigillata
)
that was a major trade good in 1st-century Europe.
[398]
Glassblowing
was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century, Egypt and the
Rhineland
had become noted for fine glass.

Music of ancient Rome
All-male theatrical troupe preparing for a masked performance, on a mosaic from the
House of the Tragic Poet
In Roman tradition, borrowed from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion. Female roles were played by men in
drag
(
travesti
). Roman literary theatre tradition is particularly well represented in
Latin literature
by the tragedies of
Seneca
.
More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying
mimus
theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqué language and sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and
dancing bears
.
[400]
Unlike literary theatre,
mimus
was played without masks, and encouraged stylistic realism. Female roles were performed by women.
[401]
Mimus
was related to
pantomimus
, an early form of
story ballet
that contained no spoken dialogue but rather a sung
libretto
, often mythological, either tragic or comic.
[402]
Trio of musicians playing an
aulos
,

Although sometimes regarded as foreign,
music
and dance existed in Rome from earliest times.
[403]
Music was customary at funerals, and the
tibia
, a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices.
[404]
Song
(
carmen
)
was integral to almost every social occasion. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos.
[405]
Various woodwinds and
"brass" instruments
were played, as were
stringed instruments
such as the
cithara
, and percussion.
[404]
The
cornu
, a long tubular metal wind instrument, was used for military signals and on parade.
[404]
These instruments spread throughout the provinces and are widely depicted in Roman art.
[406]
The hydraulic pipe organ
(
hydraulis
)
was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity", and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre.
[404]
Although certain dances were seen at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was embedded in religious rituals of archaic Rome.
[407]
Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the
mystery religions
, particularly the cults of
Cybele
[408]
and
Isis
. In the secular realm, dancing girls from
Syria
and
Cadiz
were extremely popular.
[409]
Like
gladiators
, entertainers were legally
infames
, technically free but little better than slaves. "Stars", however, could enjoy considerable wealth and celebrity, and mingled socially and often sexually with the elite.
[410]
Performers supported each other by forming guilds, and several memorials for theatre members survive.
[411]
Theatre and dance were often condemned by
Christian polemicists
in the later Empire.
[403]
[412]
Literacy, books, and education
Pride in literacy was displayed through emblems of reading and writing, as in this portrait of
Terentius Neo and his wife
(
c.
20 AD)
Estimates of the average
literacy rate
range from 5 to over 30%.
[413]
[414]
[415]
The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word.
[416]
[417]
[t]
Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out. Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe
(
scriba
)
read or write their official documents for them.
[414]
[419]
The military produced extensive written records.
[420]
The
Babylonian Talmud
declared "if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns."
[421]
Numeracy
was necessary for commerce.
[417]
[422]
Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers; some were highly educated.
[423]
Graffiti and low-quality inscriptions with misspellings and
solecisms
indicate casual literacy among non-elites.
[424]
[u]
[83]
The Romans had an extensive
priestly archive
, and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with
votives
dedicated by ordinary people, as well as "
magic spells
" (eg the
Greek Magical Papyri
).
[425]
Books were expensive, since each copy had to be written out on a papyrus roll
(volumen)
by scribes.
[426]
The
codex
—pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty in the 1st century,
[427]
but by the end of the 3rd century was replacing the
volumen
.
[428]
Commercial book production was established by the late Republic,
[429]
and by the 1st century certain neighbourhoods of Rome and Western provincial cities were known for their bookshops.
[430]
The quality of editing varied wildly,
[431]
and
plagiarism
or
forgery
were common, since there was no
copyright law
.
[429]
Reconstruction of a

Collectors amassed personal libraries,
[432]
and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure
(
otium
)
associated with the villa lifestyle.
[433]
Significant collections might attract "in-house" scholars,
[434]
and an individual benefactor might endow a community with a library (as
Pliny the Younger
did in
Comum
).
[435]
Imperial libraries were open to users on a limited basis, and represented a
literary canon
.
[436]
Books considered subversive might be publicly burned,
[437]
and
Domitian
crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.
[438]
Literary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups.
[439]
Public readings (
) expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century, giving rise to "consumer literature" for entertainment.
[440]
Illustrated books, including erotica, were popular, but are poorly represented by extant fragments.
[441]
Literacy began to decline during the
Crisis of the Third Century
.
[442]
The emperor Julian banned Christians from teaching the classical curriculum,
[443]
but the
Church Fathers
and other Christians adopted Latin and Greek literature, philosophy and science in biblical interpretation.
[444]
As the Western Roman Empire declined, reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy,
[445]
although it continued in the
Byzantine Empire
.
[446]
Education

Education in ancient Rome

[447]
Traditional Roman education was moral and practical. Stories were meant to instil Roman values
(
mores maiorum
)
. Parents were expected to act as role models, and working parents passed their skills to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships.
[448]
Young children were attended by a
pedagogue
, usually a Greek slave or former slave,
[449]
who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring.
[450]
Formal education was available only to families who could pay for it; lack of state support contributed to low literacy.
[451]
Primary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic might take place at home if parents hired or bought a teacher.
[452]
Other children attended "public" schools organized by a schoolmaster
(
ludimagister
)
paid by parents.
[453]
Vernae
(homeborn slave children) might share in-home or public schooling.
[454]
Boys and girls received primary education generally from ages 7 to 12, but classes were not segregated by grade or age.
[455]
Most schools employed
corporal punishment
.
[456]
For the socially ambitious, education in Greek as well as Latin was necessary.
[457]
Schools became more numerous during the Empire, increasing educational opportunities.
[457]

Academy of Plato
At the age of 14, upperclass males made their
rite of passage
into adulthood, and began to learn leadership roles through mentoring from a senior family member or family friend.
[458]
Higher education was provided by
grammatici
or
rhetores
.
[459]
The
grammaticus
or "grammarian" taught mainly Greek and Latin literature, with history, geography, philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text.
[460]
With the rise of Augustus, contemporary Latin authors such as Virgil and Livy also became part of the curriculum.
[461]
The
rhetor
was a teacher of oratory or public speaking. The art of speaking
(ars dicendi)
was highly prized, and
eloquentia
("speaking ability, eloquence") was considered the "glue" of civilized society.
[462]
Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge (though it required a command of the
literary canon
[463]
) as it was a mode of expression that distinguished those who held social power.
[464]
The ancient model of rhetorical training—"restraint, coolness under pressure, modesty, and good humour"
[465]
—endured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal.
[466]
In Latin,
illiteratus
could mean both "unable to read and write" and "lacking in cultural awareness or sophistication."
[467]
Higher education promoted career advancement.
[468]
Urban elites throughout the Empire shared a literary culture imbued with Greek educational ideals
(
paideia
)
.
[469]
Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher learning to express cultural achievement.
[470]
Young Roman men often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training.
[471]
On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian
endowed chairs
of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave secondary teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties.
[472]
In the Eastern Empire,
Berytus
(present-day
Beirut
) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its
school of Roman law
.
[473]
The cultural movement known as the
Second Sophistic
(1st-3rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and esthetic values.
[474]
Literate women ranged from cultured aristocrats to girls trained to be
calligraphers
and
scribes
.
[475]
[476]
The ideal woman in Augustan love poetry was educated and well-versed in the arts.
[477]
Education seems to have been standard for daughters of the senatorial and equestrian orders.
[454]
An educated wife was an asset for the socially ambitious household.

Literature under Augustus
, along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the "Golden Age" of Latin literature, embodying
classical ideals
.
[478]
The three most influential Classical Latin poets—
Virgil
,
Horace
, and
Ovid
—belong to this period. Virgil's
Aeneid
was a national epic in the manner of the
Homeric epics
of Greece. Horace perfected the use of
Greek lyric
metres
in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of Augustan morality, contributing to his exile. Ovid's
Metamorphoses
wove together
Greco-Roman mythology
; his versions of
Greek myths
became a primary source of later
classical mythology
, and his work was hugely influential on
medieval literature
.
[479]
Latin writers were immersed in
Greek literary traditions
, and adapted its forms and content, but Romans regarded
satire
as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. The early
Principate
produced the satirists
Persius
and
Juvenal
.
The mid-1st through mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the "
Silver Age
" of Latin literature. The three leading writers—
Seneca
,
Lucan
, and
Petronius
—committed suicide after incurring
Nero
's displeasure.

Pliny the Elder
, author of the encyclopedic
Natural History
; his nephew,
Pliny the Younger
; and the historian
Tacitus
.
The principal Latin prose author of the
Augustan age
is the
historian
Livy
, whose account of
Rome's founding
became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are
Dionysius of Halicarnassus
,
Josephus
, and
Cassius Dio
. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer
Plutarch
, the geographer
Strabo
, and the rhetorician and satirist
Lucian
.
The Twelve Caesars

Suetonius
is a primary source for imperial biography.

From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, Christian authors were in active dialogue with the
classical tradition
.
Tertullian
was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice. After the
conversion of Constantine
, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective.
[481]
In the late 4th century,
Jerome
produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the
Vulgate
.
Augustine
in
The City of God against the Pagans
builds a vision of an eternal, spiritual Rome, a new
imperium sine fine
that will outlast the collapsing Empire.
In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a
tessellated
quality.
[482]
A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the
Saturnalia
of
Macrobius
and
The Marriage of Philology and Mercury
of
Martianus Capella
. Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include
Ausonius
,
Prudentius
,
Claudian

A Roman priest, his

with a fold of his toga, extends a
patera
in a gesture of libation (2nd-3rd century)
The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success to their collective piety
(
pietas
)
and good relations with the gods
(
pax deorum
)
. The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest
kings of Rome
was the foundation of the
mos maiorum
, "the way of the ancestors", central to Roman identity.
[483]
The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same pool of men who held public office, and the
Pontifex Maximus
was the emperor.
Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of
do ut des
, "I give that you might give." Religion depended on knowledge and the
correct practice
of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.
[484]
Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and
libations
to the family's domestic deities. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The
Roman calendar
was structured around religious observances; as many as 135 days were devoted to
religious festivals
and games (
ludi
)
.
[485]
In the wake of the
Republic's collapse
, state religion adapted to support the new regime. Augustus justified one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform.
Public vows
now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called "emperor worship" expanded on a grand scale the traditional
veneration of the ancestral dead
and of the
Genius
, the divine
tutelary
of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (
divus
) by vote of the Senate. The
Roman imperial cult
, influenced by
Hellenistic ruler cult
, became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as
Najran
, in present-day
Saudi Arabia
.
[v]
Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with
Christianity
, which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and
superstitio
.
The emperor
Marcus Aurelius
sacrificing at the Temple of Jupiter
The Romans are known for the
great number of deities
they honoured. As the Romans extended their territories, their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating them,
[w]
building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.
[487]
By the height of the Empire, numerous
syncretic or reinterpreted gods
were cultivated, among them cults of
Cybele
,
Isis
,
Epona
, and of solar gods such as
Mithras
and
Sol Invictus
, found as far north as
Roman Britain
. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only,
religious tolerance
was not an issue.
[488]
Mystery religions
, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice, practiced in addition to one's
family rites
and public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, which conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of "
magic
", conspiracy (
coniuratio
), and subversive activity. Thus, sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists. In Gaul, the power of the
druids
was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. However, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted within the context of Imperial theology, and a new
Gallo-Roman religion
coalesced; its capital at the
Sanctuary of the Three Gauls
established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity.

The monotheistic rigour of
Judaism
posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and granting of special exemptions. Tertullian noted that Judaism, unlike Christianity, was considered a
religio licita
, "legitimate religion." The
Jewish-Roman wars
resulted from political as well as religious conflicts; the
siege of Jerusalem
in 70 AD led to the sacking of the temple and the dispersal of Jewish political power (see
Jewish diaspora
).
Christianity emerged in
Roman Judaea
as a
Jewish religious sect
in the 1st century and gradually
spread
out of
Jerusalem
throughout the Empire and beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic, with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials.
[490]
Tacitus
reports that after the
Great Fire of Rome
in AD 64, the emperor attempted to deflect blame from himself onto the Christians.
[491]
A major persecution occurred under the emperor
Domitian
[492]
and a
persecution in 177
took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A letter from
Pliny the Younger
, governor of
Bithynia
, describes his persecution and executions of Christians.
[493]
The
Decian persecution
of 246-251 seriously threatened the
Christian Church
, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance.
[494]
Diocletian
undertook the
most severe persecution of Christians
, from 303 to 311.
This funerary stele from the 3rd century is among the
earliest Christian inscriptions
, written in both Greek and Latin: the abbreviation
D.M.
at the top refers to the
Di Manes
, the traditional Roman spirits of the dead, but accompanies
Christian fish symbolism
.
From the 2nd century onward, the
Church Fathers
condemned the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire as "pagan".
[495]
In the early 4th century,
Constantine I
became the first emperor to
convert to Christianity
. He supported the Church financially and made laws that favored it, but the new religion was already successful, having moved from less than 50,000 to over a million adherents between 150 and 250.
[496]
Constantine and his successors banned public sacrifice while tolerating other traditional practices. Constantine never engaged in a
purge
,
[497]
there were no "pagan martyrs" during his reign,
[498]
and people who had not converted to Christianity remained in important positions at court.

Hadrian
in the 2nd century, later converted into a
Catholic church
in the 7th century
[500]
Christians of the 4th century believed the conversion of Constantine showed that Christianity had triumphed over paganism (in Heaven) and little further action besides such rhetoric was necessary.
[501]
Thus, their focus was
heresy
.
[502]
[503]
According to
Peter Brown
, "In most areas, polytheists were not molested, and apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence, Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable, even privileged, existence".
[503]
: 641-643
[504]
There were anti-pagan laws, but they were not generally enforced; through the 6th century, centers of paganism existed in Athens, Gaza, Alexandria, and elsewhere.
[505]
According to recent Jewish scholarship, toleration of the Jews was maintained under Christian emperors.
[506]
This did not extend to
heretics
:
[506]
Theodosius I made multiple laws and acted against alternate forms of Christianity,
[507]
and heretics were persecuted and killed by both the government and the church throughout Late Antiquity. Non-Christians were not persecuted until the 6th century. Rome's original religious hierarchy and ritual influenced Christian forms,
[508]
[509]
and many pre-Christian practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.
Legacy
Main article:
Legacy of the Roman Empire
The
Virginia State Capitol
(left)
, built in the late 1700s, was modelled after the
Maison Carrée
(right)
, in
Nîmes
, France, a
Gallo-Roman temple
built around 16 BC under Augustus.
Several states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successor. The
Holy Roman Empire
was established in 800 when
Pope Leo III
crowned
Charlemagne
as
Roman emperor
. The
Russian Tsardom
, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's
Orthodox Christian
tradition, counted itself the
Third Rome
(Constantinople having been the second), in accordance with the concept of
translatio imperii
.
[510]
The last Eastern Roman titular,
Andreas Palailogos
, sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to
Charles VIII of France
; upon Charles' death, Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to
Ferdinand and Isabella
and their successors, who never used it. When the
Ottomans
, who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453,
Mehmed II
established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire.
[511]
He even launched an
invasion of Otranto
with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire, which was aborted by his death. In the medieval West, "Roman" came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope. The Greek form
Romaioi
remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by
Greeks
.
[512]
The Roman Empire's control of the Italian peninsula influenced
Italian nationalism
and the
unification of Italy
(
Risorgimento
) in 1861.
[513]
Roman imperialism was claimed by fascist ideology, particularly by the
Italian Empire
and
Nazi Germany
.
In the United States, the
founders
were educated in the
classical tradition
,
[514]
and used classical models for
landmarks in Washington, D.C.
.
[515]
[516]
[517]
[518]
The founders saw
Athenian democracy
and
Roman republicanism
as models for the
mixed constitution
, but regarded the emperor as a figure of tyranny.

Citadel Theatre
)
[1]
is a
theatre
located on
Ferry Road
in
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
. It opened in 1932 and ceased operation in 1988. Following the efforts of Leith Theatre Trust, fundraising and campaigning is currently underway to support Leith Theatre's redevelopment and eventual full reopening as an arts and community venue.
History of the building
[
edit
]
Leith Theatre was a gift from the people of Edinburgh to the people of
Leith
, following the forced merger of the
burgh
of Leith into the larger city in 1920.
[2]

[2]
It was designed by
Bradshaw Gass & Hope
and opened in 1932.
[2]
[3]
It was badly damaged by bombing during the
Second World War
and remained closed until 1961.
[2]
The Town Hall building, which houses the Leith Theatre in its East Wing and the Thomas Morton Hall (named after the shipwright,
Thomas Morton
) in its West Wing, stands adjacent to the
Leith Library
.
[4]
The smaller Thomas Morton Hall portion of the complex is still in use, for receptions and parties.
[5]
[6]
The Leith Theatre Trust was organized in 2004 to "facilitate the refurbishment of Leith Theatre, it’s [
sic
] reopening and ongoing management."

The Maples
is a
historic house
located on 108 Montgomery Street in
Rhinebeck, New York
. It was built in the 1830s in the
Greek Revival
style
. Three decades later, its exterior was remodeled, adding
decoration
in the
picturesque
mode.
For decades, The Maples was used as medical offices. When the medical offices closed, the building was listed for sale, but remained empty for three years, falling into despair. In 2017, new owners purchased The Maples and began an extensive renovation, transforming the building into professional office suites.
Front porch entrance
In 1987, it was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
.
Property
[
edit
]
The Maples is located on a grassy 1.7-acre (6,900 m
2
)
lot
with tall shade trees in the northern portion of the village, just across from the hospital complex. A shed is in the rear, and a
stone wall
runs along the front. Both are considered
contributing resources
to its listing on the National Register.
[1]
Design
[
edit
]
The main house is a two-story, five-
bay
frame
building on a raised
fieldstone
foundation
. The
gabled
metallic roof has
cornice
returns and is pierced by four chimneys at the corners. The eastern (front)
facade
has a full-length flat-roofed
veranda
with cornice
bracketry
and
scroll-sawn
segmentally-arched knee braces. Small
Palladian windows
are located in the gable apexes on the north and south, with two quarter-round attic windows on either side.
[1]
On the west is a large two-story wing that was added later. It has a gabled roof of lower
pitch
than the main block, and bracketed cornices on the north and south elevations. A small one-story shed-roofed wing projects from the north.
[1]
The main entrance is a centrally located, recessed and paneled door flanked by
fluted
pilasters
with
Doric
capitals
. It leads to a center hallway where some original trim remains, including a late
Federal
mantelpiece
in the southeast
parlor
and original woodwork on the windows. A curving staircase, also original, leads to the second story. Most of the interior has been remodeled into office space and examining rooms.
[1]
Outside, the shed to the southwest is a flushboard and
clapboard
-
sided
one-story frame building. Its gabled roof is trimmed with a scalloped pattern. The stone wall in front with central gate posts is an original feature.

Little in the historical record describes the house's builders and original owners. Local tradition has it that a farmhouse stood there in the early 19th century when it was sold to a Jeffrey H. Champlin. The house's construction date is established by its
cornerstone
. In 1850, a map of Rhinebeck shows Champlin still owning the house.
[1]
In 1867, H. E. Welcher was listed as the owner. It is believed that he was responsible for the exterior renovations, a common trend in Rhinebeck at the time. Among the documented later owners was
William Backhouse Astor Jr.
, father of
John Jacob Astor IV
.
The Maples with the floor plan corresponding to its use as a motor lodge by John Jacob Astor IV beginning in 1901, and before the later removal of the north and south wings and 2nd floor balcony.
[2]
William Backhouse Astor Jr. purchased the 110 acre parcel containing The Maples from Griffen Hoffman in 1889, adding it to the land holdings of his Ferncliff estate.
[3]
His son John Jacob Astor IV inherited the estate, including The Maples, in 1892. In 1901 John Jacob Astor renovated The Maples according to plans drawn up by Ferncliff estate superintendent Herbert Pinkham, CE to convert the house into a motor lodge for fellow automobile enthusiasts travelling the Old Post Road between New York and Albany. The house was put at the disposal of John Jacob Astor IV's fellow members of the Automobile Club of America.
[4]
Facilities on the ground floor included a large kitchen and laundry, three parlors, one bedroom, full bath, and two wings with bay windows on the north and south sides of the house containing a billiard room and a library. The second floor contained 8 more bedrooms and full bath for lodgers, and a second floor balcony above the front porch. In the attic a water tank was installed.
[5]
These renovations are further documented by a photograph in the archives of the Museum of Rhinebeck History.
[6]
The property still appeared as part of the Astor's Ferncliff estate on a 1909 survey map.
[7]
John Jacob Astor IV perished in the Titanic disaster in 1912 and his son William Vincent Astor inherited Ferncliff. In 1914, a small parcel containing The Maples house was sold off from the estate by Vincent Astor to W.H.B. Obre,
[8]
and the owner was subsequently listed on surveys as Herbert Decker.
[9]
For unknown reasons, sometime after John Jacob Astor IV's renovations to The Maples in 1901, the wings on the north and south end of the house and the second floor balcony were removed.
A circa 1833 Greek Revival building
[10]
listed on National Register is located in Rhinebeck village.
"We aren't sure when Jeffrey Hazard moved from Rhode Island to Dutchess County, New York. His father, Thomas, is said to have moved there sometime after 1878, which would have been before the end of the War when Jeffrey was still a youngster. Some records claim that Jeffrey's twins, George and Ellis, were born in Rhode Island, which would mean he was still there in 1802. Other records say they were born in Rhinebeck, New York, where they family settled and lived out their days.[2] That suggests he could have moved to New York many years earlier."
Jeffrey Hazard was about 23 years old when he married Delight Wilbour (Wilbur or Wilbor). Again, records conflict about whether Delight and her younger sister Prudence were born in
Rhode Island
or
Dutchess County
. Delight died in 1795, the year after the marriage. It is possible her death was related to childbirth. The following year, Jeffrey married her sister Prudence.
Jeffrey and Prudence's first baby was a boy, named Hazard. He fathered nine children and lived to age 72. When Hazard was 2½, a baby sister was born, named Delight, presumably after Prudence's late sister. Three and a half years later, in November 1802, twins George and Allis joined the family. A brother John was born in 1808.
The following account comes from Bob Champlin: "Jeffrey became a wealthy man in Rhinebeck and was made a Trustee of the Rhinebeck Methodist Church on June 2, 1829 ... In the late 1700s, [he] built an estate referred to over the years first as the 'Old Homestead' and later as 'The Maples'. The property was located along the Old Post Road north of the village and consisted of 135 to 150 acres plus the mansion. Jeffrey sold it to Mr. Upton, who in turn sold it to Henry Welcher, who sold it to John van Wagner, who sold it to John Woods, who sold it to John Wilbour Champlin (son of Jeffrey). The property then passed from the Champlins' hands for good when John sold it to Griffen Hoffman. He sold the land to Mr. Ingalls, who later sold it back to him. Hoffman then sold the property to Astor.
[11]
At some point, between Astor's death and Lorenzo Decker's death, the property was sold to Decker, who died there on September 28, 1900.
When the five Hazard children reached adulthood Hazard married Mary Ann Plass, and George married Susan Underwood. Both Delight and Allis married men whose last names were Champlin. John married Jane Van Allen and later bought back the family estate.
Political journalist
Richard Rovere
owned The Maples and raised his family there. He wrote his monthly
New Yorker
column there from 1944 until his death.

Lakes
, owned and operated by
Global
and part of the
Smooth
network.
Overview
[
edit
]
Logo used to 2018
Originally known as Lakeland Radio, the station broadcasts from transmitters at Kendal on 100.1 MHz,
[1]
the western side of
Lake Windermere
on 100.8 MHz
[2]
and Keswick Forest on 101.4 MHz.
[3]
[4]
Originally licensed to serve the South Lakes, the station's coverage area extended northwards on 23 April 2013 when it began broadcasting to
Keswick
and surrounding villages.
[5]
Part of the service area overlaps with that of its
Lancaster
-based sister station The Bay (now
Heart North Lancashire & Cumbria
).
On 20 November 2017, CN Group announced Lakeland Radio would be sold to
Global
along with sister station
The Bay
- the sale was finalised by 1 December 2017.
[6]
Global later announced Lakeland Radio would become part of the
Smooth
network.
The Lakeland Radio brand and programming was phased out during February 2018 and following a transition period, the station was relaunched as Smooth Lake District at 6am on Monday 5 March 2018.
[7]
In September 2019, the station closed its Kendal studios and co-located with sister station
Smooth North West
in Manchester.
[8]
Following OFCOM's decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Smooth's local Drivetime and weekend shows were replaced by network programming from London.
[9]
Local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained, alongside the station's Lake District breakfast show.
Programming
[
edit
]
Local programming is produced and broadcast from Global's Manchester studios from 6-10am on weekdays. All networked programming originates from Global's London headquarters, including
The Smooth Drive Home
with
Angie Greaves
.
[10]
News
[
edit
]
Global's Newsroom broadcasts hourly local news bulletins from 6am-7pm on weekdays and from 6am-12pm at weekends.
[11]
National news updates air hourly from Global's London headquarters at all other times.

8th Legions Infantry Regiment
(Polish:
8 Pulk Piechoty Legionow, 8 pp Leg.
) was an infantry regiment of the
Polish Army
. It existed from 1918 until 1939. Garrisoned in
Lublin
, and belonged to the
3rd Legions Infantry Division
from
Zamość
. The regiment traced its traditions back to the 8th Infantry Regiment of the
Duchy of Warsaw
, commanded by Colonel Cyprian Godebski.
The history of the 8th Legions Infantry Regiment dates back to May 1918, when 2nd Infantry Regiment was formed in
Ostrów Mazowiecka
, by
Polska Siła Zbrojna
. In early 1919, during the
Polish-Ukrainian War
, it was renamed as the 8th Legions Infantry Regiment, and kept this name until the dissolution of Poland in October 1939. During the Nazi-Soviet
Invasion of Poland
, the regiment, together with whole 3rd Legions Infantry Division, which belonged to
Prusy Army
, fought in several major battles of the war.
Beginnings
[
edit
]
The 2nd Infantry Regiment was officially formed by Polska Siła Zbrojna on May 15, 1918. On November 1, its three battalions were sent to
Kraków
,
Lublin
and
Warsaw
, where it guarded the
Warsaw Citadel
.
In late 1918, the regiment, commanded by Ferdynand Zarzycki, was sent to eastern part of former
Austrian Galicia
, to fight against the Ukrainians. On January 16, 1919, its name was changed into the 8th Legions Infantry Regiment, and the unit was garrisoned in Lublin.
Polish-Ukrainian and Polish-Soviet Wars
[
edit
]
Battle of the Niemen River
1920
The regiment fought in Eastern Galicia and
Volhynia
from December 1918 until June 1919, suffering heavy losses. Among others, it clashed with the Ukrainians at
Rawa Ruska
(January 3, 1919),
Zolkiew
(March 9, 1919),
Magierów
,
Sknilow
,
Niemirow
(March 12, 1919) and
Belz
.
In early May 1919, the 8th Regiment became part of the 3rd Legions Division, and together with
7th Legions' Infantry Regiment
, it formed the V Legions Infantry Brigade. The new brigade clashed with the Ukrainians on May 15 near
Stary Sambor
. On June 13 it reached
Jezupol
, to be immediately sent to
Czortków
, to halt the Ukrainian offensive. On June 13-14, the brigade defeated the enemy near Denysow and Kupczynce, and then defended the town of
Brzeżany
. On July 10, the brigade crossed the
Zbrucz
river, and then it was sent northwards, to
Wilno
, to recuperate. After a few months, it was sent to the line of the
Dvina
river.
In December 1919, together with the 3rd Legions Infantry Division, the regiment was sent to
Latvia
, to protect this country from Soviet invasion. The regiment stayed there until mid-March 1920, and in mid-May 1920, it fought in a bloody battle at
Dokszyce
, losing over 200 soldiers (KIA and WIA).
In June 1920, the 3rd Legions Division was sent to the
Ukraine
, to halt the advance of the
1st Cavalry Army
, commanded by
Semyon Budyonny
. On June 28, the Poles lost
Korzec
in Volhynia, and were forced to withdraw behind the
Horyn
. In early August, it fought near
Wlodzimierz Wolynski
and
Hrubieszów
, after which the regiment participated in Polish counteroffensive, fighting near
Włodawa
, where it destroyed Soviet 58th Rifle Division. Finally, the 3rd Legions Division captured the
Brest Fortress
.
In September 1920, the regiment fought in the
Battle of the Niemen River
.
In the numerous battles of the wars of 1919-1920, the 8th Legions Infantry Regiment lost 25 officers and 471 soldiers KIA, and 96 officers and 1112 soldiers WIA. In 1928, a mound dedicated to them was erected in Lublin.
In the Second Polish Republic
[
edit
]
In May 1926, during the
May Coup (Poland)
, two battalions of the regiment (21 officers, 444 soldiers) were sent by rail to Warsaw, reaching the capital of Poland on May 14, at 8 a.m. During the street fighting, one officer (Colonel Jozef Niedzielski) was killed. The regiment, together with the 3rd Legions Division, supported
Józef Piłsudski
.
The 8th Legions Infantry Regiment supported different activities in Lublin and its area, such as concerts, holidays and sports, as it was one of sponsors of Military Sports Club
KS Lublinianka
. A residential district with houses for the officers was built in the village of Czechowo Gorne (now a neighborhood of Lublin). The regiment was frequently visited by both Józef Piłsudski and
Edward Rydz-Śmigły
.
1939 September Campaign
[
edit
]
Map of the second phase by
According to the Polish Army mobilization plan W, the 8th Regiment was to be mobilized in the first phase, to be ready for combat on the fourth day.
On August 30, 1939, the mobilization of the unit was announced, and August 31 was established as the first day. Together with the 3rd Legions Infantry Division, the regiment with its 91 officers and 3212 NCOs and soldiers, belonged to Prusy Army. The mobilization itself took place in difficult conditions, under bombardment of the
Luftwaffe
planes.
In the night of September 2/3, the 1st Battalion was sent by rail from Lublin to the frontline. The 2nd Battalion left on September 4. The 3rd Battalion did not reach
Dęblin
, as rail lines had been destroyed, and on September 6, it was transferred to the 9th Legions Infantry Regiment. Tasked with defence of the line between Dęblin and
Kazimierz Dolny
, on September 10 it clashed with the enemy near
Puławy
.
After reaching the Prusy Army, 1st and 2nd Battalions fought in several battles, such as the
Battle of Iłża
, Battle of Samsonow, and Battle of Puławy. After these battles, both battalions began to retreat southwards, to the planned
Romanian Bridgehead
. Near
Rejowiec
, they finally joined forces with the 3rd Battalion, and were reinforced with reserve units from
Chełm
. On September 22-23, the regiment clashed with the enemy in the
Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski
, and again in the
Battle of Krasnobród
.
The 8th Legions Infantry Regiment capitulated to the Germans on September 25, in the village of
Szopowe
. Before that happened, a number of officers and soldiers of the regiment had surrendered to the Soviets, who had convinced them to fight against the Wehrmacht. These officers were concentrated in
Zamość
, and sent to the camps, to be later murdered in the
Katyn massacre
.

Symbols and traditions
[

Left side of the flag
Right side of the flag
On May 15, 1920, in Budslaw (in what is now
Lithuania
), Colonel
Leon Berbecki
, commandant of the 3rd Legions Infantry Division, handed the regimental flag to its commandant, Wladyslaw Boncza-Uzdowski. The flag was funded by the residents of Lublin. During the 1939 war, the flag was with the soldiers until September 9. After the Battle of Iłża, a group of officers under Ludwik Ossowski was ordered to hide it in a safe place. They reached the area of
Frampol
, burying the flag in a local forests. Despite several efforts, it has not been found.
The regiment had two badges. First, a design by Czeslaw Jarnuszkiewicz was approved in 1921. It featured the dates 1807, when the 8th Infantry Regiment of the Duchy of Warsaw was formed, and 1918, when the Legions Regiment was formed in Ostrów Mazowiecka. The second badge was designed in 1928. It was in the shape of the Cross of Saint
Rupert of Salzburg
, with number 8 in the middle, and the initial PP Leg, plus the dates: 1807, 1918.
The regiment celebrates its holiday on May 15.
In 1943-44, the 8th Legions Infantry Regiment was re-created by the
Home Army
, for
Operation Tempest
. In June 1944, it was incorporated into the
27th Home Army Infantry Division
.

History
[
edit
]
In December 1995,
Omnitel Sistemi Radiocellulari Italiani S.p.A.
(founded on June 19, 1990, by
Olivetti
,
Lehman Brothers
,
Bell Atlantic
and
Telia
) and
Pronto Italia S.p.A.
(made up of
Zignago Vetro
,
AirTouch
,
Mannesmann
,
Banca di Roma
, Arca merchant, Comeba,
Ersel
,
ERG
,
Urmet TLC
,
Spal TLC
, Site, Ponti Radio and Fergia
[3]
[4]
) merged into
Omnitel Pronto Italia S.p.A.
, which launched a
mobile telephony
service
, the second in
Italy
after
TIM
(formerly
SIP
).
[5]
Olivetti
, the original
majority shareholder
, through Omnitel and
Infostrada
(which dealt instead with
fixed telephony
), thus competed with
Telecom Italia
, which until then
monopolized
the entire
telecommunications sector
in Italy.
In 1999 Olivetti sold its interest in Omnitel and Infostrada to the
German
consortium
Mannesmann
, after Olivetti took control of Telecom Italia.
By 1999, Mannesmann had a
majority stake
in Omnitel with a 53.7% equity stake. The following year,
Vodafone
merged
with Mannesmann thereby taking control of Omnitel. The merger led in 2002 to the change of
company name
to Vodafone Omnitel S.p.A., and in the same year the
registered office
was transferred to
Amsterdam
, changing the name again to
Vodafone Omnitel N.V.
, legally registered in the
Netherlands
.
In 2004, the company launched
UMTS
services in 140 cities and, two years later, also
HSPA
services.
In 2007, Vodafone bought the Italian and
Spanish
branches of
Tele2
.
[6]
Following the acquisition of
Tele2 Italia
(in 2010 renamed
TeleTu
), in 2008, Vodafone launched in Italy
XDSL
services, offering
Wi-Fi
and
VoIP
to its customers, and between 2013 and 2014, launched also
FTTX
services.
In 2012 has enabled
LTE
technology services in
Milan
and
Rome
.
On 16 December 2013, following
Verizon
's sale of the entire
share capital
held in the company to Vodafone, it was transformed into
Vodafone Omnitel B.V.
[7]
Between 2014 and 2015, started enabling
LTE-A
and
VoLTE
services to its mobile customers, and in 2017 launched
LTE-A Pro
services in Milan,
Palermo
and
Florence
.
On 23 November 2015, the company moved its
legal residence
in
Turin
, changing its name to
Vodafone Italia S.p.A.
, returning to be a company legally registered in Italy.
[8]
On 23 January 2017, Vodafone founded the
subsidiary
Vodafone Enabler Italia
(VEI) to provide
low-cost
mobile telephony services in competition with
Iliad
.
[9]
In 2019 launched
5G NR
services in Milan, Rome,
Turin
,
Naples
and
Bologna
. Its
GigaNetwork 5G
is considered the evolution of the previous
GigaNetwork 4.5G
, which has been re-used to launch the
5G
service.
In 2021 the company shuts down its
3G
network, in order to enhance the
4G
and 5G ones.

Used to count, measure, and label
For other uses, see
Number (disambiguation)
.
Set inclusions
between the
natural numbers
(ℕ), the
integers
(ℤ), the
rational numbers
(ℚ), the
real numbers
(ℝ), and the
complex numbers
(ℂ)
A
number
is a
mathematical object
used to
count
,
measure
, and
label
. The original examples are the
natural numbers
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
, and so forth.
[1]
Numbers can be represented in language with
number words
. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by
symbols
, called
numerals
; for example, "5" is a numeral that represents the number
five
. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a
numeral system
, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the
Hindu-Arabic numeral system
, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called
digits
.
[2]
[a]
In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with
telephone numbers
), for ordering (as with
serial numbers
), and for codes (as with
). In common usage, a
numeral
is not clearly distinguished from the
number
that it represents.
In
mathematics
, the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include
zero
(0),
[3]
negative numbers
,
[4]
rational numbers
such as
one half
(
1
2
)
{\displaystyle \left({\tfrac {1}{2}}\right)}
,
real numbers
such as the
square root of 2
(
2
)
{\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {2}}\right)}
and
π
,
[5]
and
complex numbers
[6]
which extend the real numbers with a
square root of
−1
(and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples).
[4]
Calculations
with numbers are done with
arithmetical operations
, the most familiar being
addition
,
subtraction
,
multiplication
,
division
, and
exponentiation
. Their study or usage is called
arithmetic
, a term which may also refer to
number theory
, the study of the properties of numbers.
Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.
[7]
[8]
For example, in Western society, the
number 13
is often regarded as
unlucky
, and "
a million
" may signify "a lot" rather than an exact quantity.
[7]
Though it is now regarded as
pseudoscience
, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as
numerology
, permeated ancient and medieval thought.
[9]
Numerology heavily influenced the development of
Greek mathematics
, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.
[9]
During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the
hypercomplex numbers
, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the
complex number
system. In modern mathematics, number systems are considered important special examples of more general algebraic structures such as
rings
and
fields
, and the application of the term "number" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.

History

First use of numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of ancient numeral systems
Bones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are
tally marks
.
[11]
These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.
A tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern
decimal
notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless, tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.
The first known system with place value was the
Mesopotamian base 60
system (
c.
3400
BC) and the earliest known base 10 system dates to 3100 BC in
Egypt
.
[12]
Numerals
[
edit
]
Main article:
Numeral system
Numbers should be distinguished from
numerals
, the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets.
[13]
Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the superior
Hindu-Arabic numeral system
around the late 14th century, and the Hindu-Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today.
[14]
[
better source needed
]
The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for
zero
, which was developed by ancient
Indian mathematicians
around 500 AD.
[14]
Zero
[
edit
]
The first known documented use of
zero
dates to AD 628, and appeared in the
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta
, the main work of the
Indian mathematician
Brahmagupta
. He treated 0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including
division
. By this time (the 7th century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as
Khmer numerals
, and documentation shows the idea later spreading to China and the
Islamic world
.
The number 605 in
Khmer numerals
, from an inscription from 683 AD. Early use of zero as a decimal figure.
Brahmagupta's
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta
is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as "zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number." The
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta
is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.
The use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in
place-value systems
. Many ancient texts used 0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word
nfr
to denote zero balance in
double entry accounting
. Indian texts used a
Sanskrit
word
Shunye
or
shunya
to refer to the concept of
void
. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.
[15]
In a similar vein,
Pāṇini
(5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the
Ashtadhyayi
, an early example of an
algebraic grammar
for the Sanskrit language (also see
Pingala
).
There are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta
.
Records show that the
Ancient Greeks
seemed unsure about the status of 0 as a number: they asked themselves "How can 'nothing' be something?" leading to interesting
philosophical
and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of 0 and the
vacuum
. The
paradoxes
of
Zeno of Elea
depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of 0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether
1
was a number.)
The late
Olmec
people of south-central Mexico began to use a symbol for zero, a shell
glyph
, in the New World, possibly by the
4th century BC
but certainly by 40 BC, which became an integral part of
Maya numerals
and the
Maya calendar
. Maya arithmetic used base 4 and base 5 written as base 20.
George I. Sánchez
in 1961 reported a base 4, base 5 "finger" abacus.
[16]
[
better source needed
]
By 130 AD,
Ptolemy
, influenced by
Hipparchus
and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for 0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a
sexagesimal
numeral system otherwise using alphabetic
Greek numerals
. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this
Hellenistic zero
was the first
documented
use of a true zero in the Old World. In later
Byzantine
manuscripts of his
Syntaxis Mathematica
(
Almagest
), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the
Greek letter
Omicron
(otherwise meaning 70).
Another true zero was used in tables alongside
Roman numerals
by 525 (first known use by
Dionysius Exiguus
), but as a word,
nulla
meaning
nothing
, not as a symbol. When division produced 0 as a remainder,
nihil
, also meaning
nothing
, was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval
computists
(calculators of
Easter
). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by
Bede
or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.

History of negative numbers
The abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100-50 BC in China.
The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art
contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive
coefficients
, black for negative.
[17]
The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd century AD in Greece.
Diophantus
referred to the equation equivalent to
4
x
+ 20 = 0
(the solution is negative) in
Arithmetica
, saying that the equation gave an absurd result.
During the 600s, negative numbers were in use in India to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician
Brahmagupta
, in
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta
in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form
quadratic formula
that remains in use today. However, in the 12th century in India,
Bhaskara
gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value "is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots".
European mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th century, although
Fibonacci
allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter 13 of
Liber Abaci
, 1202) and later as losses (in
Flos
).
René Descartes
called them false roots as they cropped up in algebraic polynomials yet he found a way to swap true roots and false roots as well. At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.
[18]
The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by
Nicolas Chuquet
during the 15th century. He used them as
exponents
, but referred to them as "absurd numbers".
As recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless.
Rational numbers
[
edit
]
It is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to
prehistoric times
. The
Ancient Egyptians
used their
Egyptian fraction
notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the
Rhind Mathematical Papyrus
and the
Kahun Papyrus
. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of
number theory
.
[19]
The best known of these is
Euclid's
Elements
, dating to roughly 300 BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the
Sthananga Sutra
, which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.
The concept of
decimal fractions
is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math
sutra
to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to
pi
or the
square root of 2
.

Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base 60) fractions with great frequency.
Irrational numbers

History of irrational numbers
The earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the
Indian
Sulba Sutras
composed between 800 and 500 BC.
[20]

The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to
Pythagoras
, more specifically to the
Pythagorean
Hippasus of Metapontum
, who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the
square root of 2
. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.
[21]

The 16th century brought final European acceptance of
negative
integral and
fractional
numbers. By the 17th  century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since
Euclid
. In 1872, the publication of the theories of
Karl Weierstrass
(by his pupil E. Kossak),
Eduard Heine
,
[22]
Georg Cantor
,
[23]
and
Richard Dedekind
[24]
was brought about. In 1869,
Charles Méray
had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by
Salvatore Pincherle
(1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by
Paul Tannery
(1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a
cut (Schnitt)
in the system of
real numbers
, separating all
rational numbers
into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass,
Kronecker
,
[25]
and Méray.
The search for roots of
quintic
and higher degree equations was an important development, the
Abel-Ruffini theorem
(
Ruffini
1799,
Abel
1824) showed that they could not be solved by
radicals
(formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of
algebraic numbers
(all solutions to polynomial equations).
Galois
(1832) linked polynomial equations to
group theory
giving rise to the field of
Galois theory
.
Continued fractions
, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of
Euler
,
[26]
and at the opening of the 19th century were brought into prominence through the writings of
Joseph Louis Lagrange
. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenmüller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and Günther (1872). Ramus
[27]
first connected the subject with
determinants
, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine,
[28]
Möbius
, and Günther,
[29]
in the theory of
Kettenbruchdeterminanten
.
Transcendental numbers and reals
[
edit
]
Further information:
History of π
The existence of
transcendental numbers
[30]
was first established by
Liouville
(1844, 1851).
Hermite
proved in 1873 that
e
is transcendental and
Lindemann
proved in 1882 that π is transcendental. Finally,
Cantor
showed that the set of all
real numbers
is
uncountably infinite
but the set of all
algebraic numbers
is
countably infinite
, so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.
Infinity and infinitesimals
[
edit

Further information:
History of infinity
The earliest known conception of mathematical
infinity
appears in the
Yajur Veda
, an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, "If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity." Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the
Jain
mathematicians c. 400 BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually. The symbol
∞
{\displaystyle {\text{∞}}}
is often used to represent an infinite quantity.
Aristotle
defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between
actual infinity
and
potential infinity
—the general consensus being that only the latter had true value.
Galileo Galilei
's
Two New Sciences
discussed the idea of
one-to-one correspondences
between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by
Georg Cantor
; in 1895 he published a book about his new
set theory
, introducing, among other things,
transfinite numbers
and formulating the
continuum hypothesis
.
In the 1960s,
Abraham Robinson
showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of
hyperreal numbers
represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about
infinite
and
infinitesimal
numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of
infinitesimal calculus
by
Newton
and
Leibniz
.
A modern geometrical version of infinity is given by
projective geometry
, which introduces "ideal points at infinity", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in
perspective
drawing.
Complex numbers
[

History of complex numbers
The earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor
Heron of Alexandria
in the
1st century AD
, when he considered the volume of an impossible
frustum
of a
pyramid
. They became more prominent when in the 16th century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as
Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia
and
Gerolamo Cardano
. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.
This was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When
René Descartes
coined the term "imaginary" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See
imaginary number
for a discussion of the "reality" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation
(
−
1
)
2
=
−
1
−
1
=
−
1
{\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {-1}}\right)^{2}={\sqrt {-1}}{\sqrt {-1}}=-1}
seemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity
a
b
=
a
b
,
{\displaystyle {\sqrt {a}}{\sqrt {b}}={\sqrt {ab}},}
which is valid for positive real numbers
a
and
b
, and was also used in complex number calculations with one of
a
,
b
positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity
1
a
=
1
a
{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {a}}}={\sqrt {\frac {1}{a}}}}
in the case when both
a
and
b
are negative even bedeviled
Euler
.
[31]
This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol
i
in place of
−
1
{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}
to guard against this mistake.
The 18th century saw the work of
Abraham de Moivre
and
Leonhard Euler
.
De Moivre's formula
(1730) states:
(
cos

i

θ
)
n

cos
⁡
n
θ

sin
⁡

{\displaystyle (\cos \theta +i\sin \theta )^{n}=\cos n\theta +i\sin n\theta }
while
Euler's formula
of
complex analysis
(1748) gave us:
cos
⁡
θ
+
i
sin
⁡
θ
=
e
i
θ
.
{\displaystyle \cos \theta +i\sin \theta =e^{i\theta }.}
The existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until
Caspar Wessel
described the geometrical interpretation in 1799.
Carl Friedrich Gauss
rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in
Wallis
's
De algebra tractatus
.
In the same year, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra
, showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. Gauss studied complex numbers of the form
a
+
bi
, where
a
and
b
are integers (now called
Gaussian integers
) or rational numbers. His student,
Gotthold Eisenstein
, studied the type
a
+
bω
, where
ω
is a complex root of
x
3
− 1 = 0
(now called
Eisenstein integers
). Other such classes (called
cyclotomic fields
) of complex numbers derive from the
roots of unity
x
k
− 1 = 0
for higher values of
k
. This generalization is largely due to
Ernst Kummer
, who also invented
ideal numbers
, which were expressed as geometrical entities by
Felix Klein
in 1893.
In 1850
Victor Alexandre Puiseux
took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of
essential singular points
.
[

This eventually led to the concept of the
extended complex plane
.
Prime numbers
[
edit
]
Prime numbers
have been studied throughout recorded history.
[

]
They are positive integers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. Euclid devoted one book of the
Elements
to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic
, and presented the
Euclidean algorithm
for finding the
greatest common divisor
of two numbers.
In 240 BC,
Eratosthenes
used the
Sieve of Eratosthenes
to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the
Renaissance
and later eras.
[
]
In 1796,
Adrien-Marie Legendre
conjectured the
prime number theorem
, describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the
Goldbach conjecture
, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the
Riemann hypothesis
, formulated by
Bernhard Riemann
in 1859. The
prime number theorem
was finally proved by
Jacques Hadamard
and
Charles de la Vallée-Poussin
in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.

and the
real numbers

The natural numbers, starting with 1
The most familiar numbers are the
natural numbers
(sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with 1 (0 was not even considered a number for the
Ancient Greeks
.) However, in the 19th century,
set theorists
and other mathematicians started including 0 (
cardinality
of the
empty set
, i.e. 0 elements, where 0 is thus the smallest
cardinal number
) in the set of natural numbers.
[32]
[33]
Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including 0 or not. The
mathematical symbol
for the set of all natural numbers is
N
, also written
N
{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
, and sometimes
N
0
{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} _{0}}
or
N
1
{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} _{1}}
when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.
In the
base 10
numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten
digits
: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The
radix or base
is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base 10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a
place value
of 1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.
In
set theory
, which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,
[34]
natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number 3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in
Peano Arithmetic
, the number 3 is represented as sss0, where s is the "successor" function (i.e., 3 is the third successor of 0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent 3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.
Integers
[
edit
]
Main article:
Integer
The
negative
of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces 0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a
minus sign
). As an example, the negative of 7 is written −7, and
7 + (−7) = 0
. When the
set
of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including 0), the result is defined as the set of
integers
,
Z
also written
Z
{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
. Here the letter Z comes from
German
Zahl
'number'. The set of integers forms a
ring
with the operations addition and multiplication.
[35]
The natural numbers form a
subset
of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as
positive integers
, and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as
non-negative integers
.
Rational numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
Rational number
A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a
fraction
with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction
m
/
n
represents
m
parts of a whole divided into
n
equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example
1
/
2
and
2
/
4
are equal, that is:
1
2
=
2
4
.
{\displaystyle {1 \over 2}={2 \over 4}.}
In general,
a
b
=
c
d
{\displaystyle {a \over b}={c \over d}}
if and only if
a
×
d
=
c
×
b
.
{\displaystyle {a\times d}={c\times b}.}
If the
absolute value
of
m
is greater than
n
(supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than 1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to 1 and can also be positive, negative, or 0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator 1. For example −7 can be written
−7
/
1
. The symbol for the rational numbers is
Q
(for
quotient
), also written
Q
{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }
.
Real numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
Real number
The symbol for the real numbers is
R
, also written as
R
.
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .}
They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the
number line
. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a
minus sign
, e.g. −123.456.
Most real numbers can only be
approximated
by
decimal
numerals, in which a
decimal point
is placed to the right of the digit with place value 1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents
123456
/
1000
, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its
fractional part
has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02. Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern. Such a decimal is called a
repeating decimal
. Thus
1
/
3
can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.
3
.
[36]
It turns out that these repeating decimals (including the
repetition of zeroes
) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called
irrational
. A famous irrational real number is the
π
, the ratio of the
circumference
of any circle to its
diameter
. When pi is written as
π
=
3.14159265358979
…
,
{\displaystyle \pi =3.14159265358979\dots ,}
as it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that
π
is irrational
. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is
2
=
1.41421356237
…
,
{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}=1.41421356237\dots ,}
the
square root of 2
, that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions
( 1 trillion = 10
12
= 1,000,000,000,000 )
of digits.
Not only these prominent examples but
almost all
real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting
rounded
or
truncated
real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only
countably many
. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a
margin of error
. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to
1234555
/
10000
and strictly less than
1234565
/
10000
(rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number greater or equal to
123456
/
1000
and strictly less than
123457
/
1000
(truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called
significant digits
. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001
m
. If the sides of a
rectangle
are measured as 1.23 m and 4.56 m, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between
5.614591 m
2
and
5.603011 m
2
. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not
significant
. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.
Just as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example,
0.999...
, 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number 1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places. In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros. Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000.... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the rightmost nonzero digit, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing by one the rightmost digit less than 9, and changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of a decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85. Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place. For example, 99.999... = 100.
The real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the
least upper bound
property.
It can be shown that any
ordered field
, which is also
complete
, is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an
algebraically closed field
, because they do not include a solution (often called a
square root of minus one
) to the algebraic equation
x
2
+
1
=
0
{\displaystyle x^{2}+1=0}
.
Complex numbers

Main article:
Complex number
Moving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the
complex numbers
. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of
cubic
and
quadratic
polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a
square root
of −1, denoted by
i
, a symbol assigned by
Leonhard Euler
, and called the
imaginary unit
. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form
a
+
b
i
{\displaystyle \,a+bi}
where
a
and
b
are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the
complex plane
, a
vector space
of two real
dimensions
. In the expression
a
+
bi
, the real number
a
is called the
real part
and
b
is called the
imaginary part
. If the real part of a complex number is 0, then the number is called an
imaginary number
or is referred to as
purely imaginary
; if the imaginary part is 0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a
subset
of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a
Gaussian integer
. The symbol for the complex numbers is
C
or
C
{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
.
The
fundamental theorem of algebra
asserts that the complex numbers form an
algebraically closed field
, meaning that every
polynomial
with complex coefficients has a
root
in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a
field
, which is
complete
, but unlike the real numbers, it is not
ordered
. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that
i
is greater than 1, nor is there any meaning in saying that
i
is less than 1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a
total order
that is
compatible with field operations
.
Subclasses of the integers

Even and odd numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
Even and odd numbers
An
even number
is an integer that is "evenly divisible" by two, that is
divisible by two without remainder
; an
odd number
is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term "evenly divisible" is now almost always shortened to "
divisible
".) Any odd number
n
may be constructed by the formula
n
= 2
k
+ 1,
for a suitable integer
k
. Starting with
k
= 0,
the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number
m
has the form
m
= 2
k
where
k
is again an
integer
. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.
Prime numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
Prime number
A
prime number
, often shortened to just
prime
, is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered. The study of these questions belongs to
number theory
.
Goldbach's conjecture
is an example of a still unanswered question: "Is every even number the sum of two primes?"
One answered question, as to whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, was confirmed; this proven claim is called the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic
. A proof appears in
Euclid's Elements
.
Other classes of integers
[
edit
]
Many subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are
Fibonacci numbers
and
perfect numbers
. For more examples, see
Integer sequence
.
Subclasses of the complex numbers
[
edit
]
Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers
[
edit
]
Algebraic numbers
are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called
irrational numbers
. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called
transcendental numbers
. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a
monic polynomial
equation with integer coefficients are called
algebraic integers
.
Constructible numbers
[
edit
]
Motivated by the classical problems of
constructions with straightedge and compass
, the
constructible numbers
are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.
Computable numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
Computable number
A
computable number
, also known as
recursive number
, is a
real number
such that there exists an
algorithm
which, given a positive number
n
as input, produces the first
n
digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using
μ-recursive functions
,
Turing machines
or
λ-calculus
. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a
polynomial
, and thus form a
real closed field
that contains the real
algebraic numbers
.
The computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.
The set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore,
almost all
real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.
Extensions of the concept
[
edit
]
p
-adic numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
p
-adic number
The
p
-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what
base
is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a
prime number
base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the
p
-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.
The elements of an
algebraic function field
over a
finite field
and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see
Function field analogy
). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The
p
-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.
Hypercomplex numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
hypercomplex number
Some number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called
hypercomplex numbers
. They include the
quaternions
H
, introduced by Sir
William Rowan Hamilton
, in which multiplication is not
commutative
, the
octonions
, in which multiplication is not
associative
in addition to not being commutative, and the
sedenions
, in which multiplication is not
alternative
, neither associative nor commutative.
Transfinite numbers
[
edit
]
Main article:
transfinite number
For dealing with infinite
sets
, the natural numbers have been generalized to the
ordinal numbers
and to the
cardinal numbers
. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.
Nonstandard numbers
[
edit
]
Hyperreal numbers
are used in
non-standard analysis
. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *
R
), denote an
ordered field
that is a proper
extension
of the ordered field of
real numbers
R
and satisfies the
transfer principle
. This principle allows true
first-order
statements about
R
to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *
R
.
Superreal
and
surreal numbers
extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form
fields
.

Guy Hulett Watkins
was a lawyer and United States Army
Lieutenant Colonel
during the
American Civil War
.
Formative years
[
edit
]
Watkins was born in
Towanda, Pennsylvania
, and completed his education at a seminary in
Lima, New York
.
Legal and political career
[
edit
]
After completing his education, he joined the law practice of his father, William Watkins, where he was trained to become an attorney. He was subsequently admitted to the bar on September 9, 1853.
In 1859, he was elected
district attorney
.
American Civil War
[
edit
]
Watkins had not yet finished his term as district attorney when
southern states began to secede from the Union
in 1860 and was still a sitting district attorney when the
American Civil War
began in April 1861. As the war continued into its second year, he decided to enroll for military service and was commissioned as an officer with the
141st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment
, a newly-formed, infantry regiment of the Pennsylvania Volunteers that was established at
Camp Curtin
in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on August 29, 1862.
[1]
[2]
1862
[
edit
]
One of the officers who commanded the members of the 141st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry as it marched up the
Potomac River
to
Leesburg, Virginia
and on to
Falmouth
from October 11 to November 19, 1862 as part of the
Union Army
forces assembled in the region, Watkins also commanded men in the intense combat of the
Battle of Fredericksburg
, Virginia from December 12 to 15 that year.
[3]
[4]
1863
[
edit
]
From January 20 to 24, 1863, Watkins and his men took part in the ill-fated "
Mud March
" spearheaded by Union Army Major General
Ambrose Burnside
. They were then assigned to occupation duties at Falmouth until April, when they were ordered to move toward
Charlottesville
. Participants in the Union's Chancellorsville Campaign from April 27 to May 6, they endured their second major combat experience during the
Battle of Chancellorsville
from May 1 to 5.
[5]
[6]
Ordered to proceed to the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
to defend the state and its residents from
Confederate States Army
troops commanded by
Robert E. Lee
, Watkins and his men were subsequently engaged in halting the CSA's
Gettysburg Campaign
from June 11 to July 24, during which time they fought in their third major battle, the
Battle of Gettysburg
, which took place from July 1 to 3, 1863.
[7]
[8]
Given little time to rest, Watkins and his men were ordered to pursue Lee and his troops, which they did, marching rapidly through Pennsylvania, Maryland, and on into Virginia from July 5 to 23, where they re-engaged with the enemy at
Wapping Heights
on July 23.
[9]
[10]
Assigned to line duties along the
Rappahannock
and
Rapidan
rivers through early October, they were then reassigned to the Union's
Bristoe Campaign
from October 9 to 22, during which time they fought in the
First Battle of Auburn
on October 13.
[11]
[12]
Ordered to advance to the Union Army's line on the Rappahannock from November 7 to 8, they next fought in the
Battle of Kelly's Ford
on November 7. Assigned next to the Union's Mine Run Campaign from November 26 to December 2, 1863, they fought Confederate troops again, this time in the
Battle of Payne's Farm
on November 27.
[13]
[14]
1864
[
edit
]
From February 6 to 7, 1864, Watkins and his fellow 141st Pennsylvania Volunteers participated in the Union's Demonstration on the Rapidan and then in the Rapidan Campaign from May 4 to June 12, during which time they fought in the
Battle of the Wilderness
from May 5 to 7 and the
Battle of Laurel Hill
on May 8, gained control of areas in and around
Spotsylvania
from May 8 to 12 and the
Po River
on May 10, fought in the
Battle of Spotsylvania Court House
from May 12 to 21, assaulted the salient near there on May 12, engaged the enemy near the Harris Farm on May 19, and fought in the
Battle of North Anna
from May 23 to 26. Assigned to line duties on the
Pamunkey River
from May 26 to 28, they next fought in the
Battle of Totopotomoy Creek
from May 28 to 31 and in the long and brutal
Battle of Cold Harbor
from June 1 to 12.
[15]
[16]
Moved into position in preparation for military actions against the CSA troops that had dug in to protect the city of
Petersburg, Virginia
, Watkins and his men subsequently took part in the
Siege of Petersburg
, beginning on June 16, 1864.

Record producer
Musical artist
John Edward Burgess
(8 March 1932 - 13 March 2014)
[1]
was a British record producer and production company executive.  In the 1960s, he produced hit records by
Adam Faith
,
Freddie and the Dreamers
,
Manfred Mann
, and many other acts of the early era of the
British invasion
.
Career
[
edit
]
1950s
[
edit
]
Born in London, Burgess started working in the promotion and publicity section of
EMI
in 1951.
[2]
When the company took over
Capitol Records
, he was responsible for promoting its artists including
Frank Sinatra
,
Peggy Lee
and
Dean Martin
.
[3]
By the mid-1950s, he had become assistant to
record producer
Norman Newell
.
[4]
In 1959, as Newell was unavailable for the
recording session
,
[5]
Burgess was given responsibility for producing then-unknown
Adam Faith
's fourth single, "
What Do You Want?
".  Arranged by
John Barry
, it rose to number one on the
UK Singles Chart
for three weeks in December 1959.
[6]
The record company wished to stick to a successful formula, and so Burgess was retained as producer for Faith's follow-up record, "
Poor Me
", also a number one UK hit, and then for subsequent releases by the singer until the mid-1960s.
1960s
[
edit
]
He produced many of the recordings by
the John Barry Seven
, including their hit single "The
James Bond Theme
" in 1962.
[5]
From 1963, Burgess produced a series of UK hits by
Freddie and the Dreamers
, including "
If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody
" and "
I'm Telling You Now
", which hit number one on the American
Billboard
Hot 100
in 1965.
[7]
Burgess was also impressed by a
jazz
and
R&B
-influenced band known variously as the Mann-Hugg Blues Brothers or the Manfreds.  Changing the band's name to that of their leader,
Manfred Mann
,
[8]
Burgess produced their early UK hits including "
5-4-3-2-1
", "
Do Wah Diddy Diddy
", and "
Pretty Flamingo
".
[9]
He turned down the opportunity to record The High Numbers (later
The Who
),
[10]
but produced hit records by
Peter and Gordon
,
David and Jonathan
,
Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers
,
Paul Jones
,
Matt Monro
,
The Congregation
,
The Pipkins
, and early singles by
The Sweet
.
[11]
[12]
Burgess also produced albums of the musicals
Barnum
and
Guys and Dolls
.
[2]
In 1965, together with
George Martin
and
Ron Richards
of EMI, and
Peter Sullivan
of
Decca
, he helped set up
Associated Independent Recording
(AIR), one of the earliest independent record production companies.
[13]
1970s
[
edit
]
From 1969, he was the managing director of AIR Studios in London, and, in 1979, became the managing director of AIR Studios in
Montserrat
, in the
West Indies
.
[2]
Death
[
edit
]
Burgess died in March 2014, aged 82.

Brackley Cricket Club Ground
(Also called Westminster Road) is a
cricket
ground in
Brackley
,
Northamptonshire
.  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1962, when Brackley Cricket Club moved from its original ground at Manor Road.
In 1971, the ground held its first
List-A
match when
Northamptonshire
played
Gloucestershire
in the
John Player League
.  From 1971 to 1975, the ground hosted 5 List-A matches, the last of which saw Northamptonshire play
Nottinghamshire
in 1975 John Player League.
[1]
In local domestic cricket, the ground is the home venue of Brackley Cricket Club.
[2]
Previous grounds
[

"Bandilands"
[
edit
]
The first recorded game of cricket in Brackley was in 1827, when 11 gentlemen from Brackley were defeated by 11 form the neighboring village of
Syresham
. It's assumed that this match was played at the Bandilands (sometimes referred to as Bandlands) ground, which was located close to a toll gate on the
Buckingham
, Brackely and
Banbury
turnpike - this is now the
A422
.
Bandilands hosted Brackley for many years, in games vs local teams such as Banbury and Deddington (1830s), Buckingham (1842 - this match brought with it much controversy as Buckingham fielded a player who farmed half a mile away from Buckingham itself. Brackley objected stating it was arranged to be "town against town, not parish against parish"
[3]
). In June 1865, "a large company" assembled to watch George Parr's
All-England Eleven
defeat 22 from Brackley Cricket Club (including Joseph Timms, grandfather of future
Northamptonshire County Cricket Club
stalwart Jack Timms) by 80 runs.
[4]
A year later,
Surrey
professionals
Thomas Humphrey
and
Harry Jupp
brought a team to Brackley, and comfortably beat 16 locals, though this game "did not attract a large attendance". In 1882, Brackley CC competed in the inaugural Northamptonshire Rural Challenge Cup, beating
Eydon
by an innings in the first round but losing to
Rushden
in the second (Rushden were the eventual winners of the tournament).
"Manor Road"
[
edit
]
Bandilands was home to Brackley CC until 1910, when they moved to one of the school's playing fields for a yearly rent of £15 10s around the outbreak of the First World War (approximately £1,120.33 today). The club had many concerns over its security of tenure at the Manor Road ground and was eventually asked to leave the ground in September 1960 as the playing field was required full time by the school.
"Westminster Road"
[
edit
]
Following being asked to leave Manor Road, Brackley Cricket Club found its new home at Westminster Road, which was leased from Brackley Borough Council on 20 May 1961. Brackley CC continue to call Westminster Road home to this day.
Northamptonshire Cricket Club matches
[
edit
]
At Brackley Cricket Club's annual dinner in 1952, then Northamptonshire captain
Freddie Brown
promised to bring county Second XI cricket to Brackley, and this he did as Manor Road played host to Northants Second XI fixtures between 1954 and 1955. Various benefit matches were hosted in Brackley too, which were well supported.
In July 1971, however, Brackley hosted its first Northamptonshire First XI game versus
Gloucestershire
in the
John Player League
. Spectators took their seats on straw bales around the ground as they watched Gloucestershire (including
Mike Procter
) beat Northants in a tightly contested match.
Sussex
were scheduled to visit Westminster Road in 1972, but poor weather meant the game was to be abandoned before a ball could be bowled. Brackley were then scheduled to host the lucrative match versus
Kent
in 1973, which could bring any number of cricket stars to the ground, including
Brian Luckhurst
,
Asif Iqbal
,
Alan Knott
and
Derek Underwood
. Northamptonshire were on the receiving end of a rather heavy loss which is still, to this day, the county's second-heaviest defeat by runs in a List A competition. Northants hosted
Somerset
in 1974 (when they were beaten again), as spectators from the town were treated to a century from
Peter Denning
, but also a brisk 35 from
Viv Richards
, who was 22 at the time and playing his first season of county cricket, as well as a 4 wicket haul from
Bob Clapp
. The final Northants match to be played at Westminster Road was in 1975, when Northants hosted
Nottinghamshire
. The hosts had better fortunes and won by six wickets.

Mint green Annabergite, a nickel arsenite
The
Nickel oxyacid salts
are a class of chemical compounds of
nickel
with an
oxyacid
. The compounds include a number of minerals and industrially important
nickel compounds
.
Nickel(II) sulfate can crystallise with six water molecules yielding
Retgersite
or with seven making
Morenosite
which is isomorphic to Epsom salts. These contain the hexaquanickel(II) ion.
[1]
There is also an
anhydrous
form, a dihydrate and a tetrahydrate, the last two crystallised from sulfuric acid. The hexahydrate has two forms, a blue tetragonal form, and a green
monoclinic
form, with a transition temperature around 53 °C.
[2]
The heptahydrate crystallises from water below 31.5 above this blue hexhydrate forms, and above 53.3 the green form.
[3]
Heating nickel sulfate dehydrates it, and then 700° it loses
sulfur trioxide
, sulfur dioxide and oxygen.
Nickel sulfite can be formed by bubbling sulfur dioxide through
nickel carbonate
suspended in water. A solution is formed that slowly loses sulfur dioxide, and which crystallises nickel sulfite hexahydrate. Crystals are frequently in the shape of stars, caused by the two opposite triangular
enantiomorphs
growing base to base. nickel sulfite hexahydrate is highly
piezoelectric
. Optically it is uniaxial negative with refractive indexes ω=1.552 ε=1.509.
[4]
When heated it dehydrates and then ends up producing nickel oxide and nickel sulfate.
[5]
Nickel thiosulfate NiS

has the same structure as the magnesium salt. It has alternating layers of octahedral shaped nickel
2+
hexahydrate, and tetrahedral shaped S

perpendicular to the β direction.
[6]
When heated to 90 °C it decomposes to form NiS. NiS

and NiSO

.
[7]
Nickel sulfamate can be used for nickel or mixed nickel-tungsten plating.
[8]
It can be formed by the action of sulfamic acid on nickel carbonate.

Notes
Passenger statistics from the
Office of Rail and Road
Llanelli
railway station
is the
railway station
serving the town of
Llanelli
,
Carmarthenshire
,
Wales
.  It is located on the
West Wales line
and the
Heart of Wales line
225
miles
20
chains
(362.5 km) from the zero point at
London Paddington
, measured via Stroud.
[1]
The station and the majority of trains calling are operated by
Transport for Wales
.
It is located between two
level crossings
(known as East and West) that were previously upgraded in the 1970s. In 2015,
Network Rail
carried out a further upgrade which saw the control of these level crossings pass from the Grade-II listed
Llanelli
West
signal box
(which worked the two crossings here only since 1973) to Port Talbot Panel
Signal Box
using CCTV.

History
[
edit
]
Main article:
Llanelli railway strike
Llanelli
railway station was the scene for the
Llanelli Riots of 1911
. The Llanelli Riots took place on 19 August 1911. Their immediate cause was the very first railway strike which lasted only two days.
[3]
The strike started on Thursday evening, and by Saturday evening two young men had been shot dead by the military.
[4]
One man was killed when a railway truck exploded and, on the following day, three more people died from their injuries.
[

The story of the Riots is set in a period of great industrial unrest, and involves prominent figures on the international scene such as
Lloyd George
,
Winston Churchill
,
King George V
, and
Kaiser Wilhelm
of
Germany
.
[

Facilities
[
edit
]
The station is staffed, with the ticket office on platform 2. A self-service ticket machine is provided for use when the booking office is closed and for collecting advance purchase/pre-paid tickets. The main buildings on this platform also house a newsagents shop, toilets, help point and post box. Platform 1 has canopies, bench seating and a customer help point. Digital CIS displays, timetable posters and automated announcements provide train running information. The platforms are linked by a footbridge with steps, but level access is possible to both platforms using the east level crossing and nearby road.

Services
[
edit
]
Llanelli
in July 1971.
Transport for Wales
operate an approximately hourly service in each direction along the West Wales Line, from
Manchester Piccadilly
and
Cardiff Central
via
Swansea
to
Carmarthen
, with two-hourly extensions to
Milford Haven
. There is a separate (roughly two-hourly service) between Swansea and
Pembroke Dock
via
Tenby
that calls, along with the twice-daily service to and from
Fishguard Harbour
that runs to connect with the ferry to/from
Rosslare
.
[6]
The six daily
Great Western Railway
services between Carmarthen and
London Paddington
also calls here. Great Western Railway also operates a summer Saturday service between London and Pembroke Dock.
There are six trains a day in each direction on the
Heart of Wales line
to
Shrewsbury
, plus a fifth morning peak train (Mon-Fri only) to/from
Llandovery
. As the line from Swansea also enters
Llanelli
from the east, these trains must reverse direction here (in platform 2, which is signalled accordingly) to continue their journeys.
[7]
Future services
[
edit
]
In December 2022, the ORR approved Grand Union to commence a new service from Paddington to Carmarthen in partnership with Spanish rail operator
Renfe
, for which a fleet of new bi-mode trains will be used. The new service is scheduled to commence in December 2024.
[8]
The service will call at Bristol Parkway, Severn Tunnel Junction, Newport, Cardiff Central,
Gowerton
and Llanelli en-route to Carmarthen.

A
gross receipts tax
or
gross excise tax
is a
tax
on the total gross revenues of a company, regardless of their source. A gross receipts tax is often compared to a
sales tax
; the difference is that a gross receipts tax is levied upon the seller of goods or services, while a sales tax is nominally levied upon the buyer (although both are usually collected and paid to the government by the seller). This is compared to other taxes listed as separate line items on billings, are not directly included in the listed price of the item, and are not a factor in markup or profit on company sales. A gross receipts tax has a pyramid effect that increases the actual taxable percentage as it passes through the product or service lifecycle.
[1]
Another pyramid effect of the tax comes from the fact that such a tax by definition is levied against itself (in the sense that a business subject to a gross receipts tax will raise its prices to compensate, which in turn increases its gross revenue, which increases the tax owed, and so on in circles) and therefore amounts to a tax on tax. Thus, the actual tax rate of a gross receipts tax is always slightly higher than the nominal tax rate.  This is easiest to discern in jurisdictions like Hawaii where businesses are allowed to visibly pass on gross excise tax to their customers.
[2]
Criticism
[
edit
]
Economists have criticized gross receipts taxes for encouraging
vertical integration
among companies and imposing different effective tax rates across different industries.
[3]
United States
[
edit
]
Several
states
in the
United States
have imposed gross receipts taxes.
Alabama
- Per Article 3 of the code of Alabama,
[4]
the state has imposed this type of tax on most utilities.
Delaware
- Business and occupational gross receipts tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the business activity.
[5]
Florida
- A tax of 2.5% is imposed on "gross receipts from the sale, delivery, or transportation of natural gas, manufactured gas, or electricity to a retail consumer in Florida," referring to utility companies (suppliers of electrical power).
[6]
Hawaii
- Hawaii imposes its General Excise Tax (GET) as a gross receipts tax on all business done in Hawaii, at 0.5% for wholesaling and manufacturing, 0.15% for insurance commissions, and 4% (4.5% in
Honolulu County
) for all other activities. Businesses may pass on the GET as a sales-tax-like surcharge but are not required to do so.
[2]
Illinois
- Illinois policy makers are considering a 1% gross receipts tax to increase the foundation level for Illinois public schools, as well as to fund a host of educational accountability initiatives.  The tax is expected to generate enough revenue to replace the state share of the retail sales tax, corporate franchise taxes, and corporate income taxes.  Proponents claim that it is simple for both the government and business to administer, easy for the public to understand, broad-based, stable, and progressive.  An editorial article in the
Chicago Tribune
called it "the best idea" for education funding reform,
[7]
but some statewide business leaders have rushed to condemn it.
Nevada
- Nevada adopted a Commerce Tax in 2015.
[8]
Businesses are taxed on Nevada gross receipts in excess of $4 million at a rate varying from 0.051% to 0.331%, depending upon economic sector.
New Mexico
- The gross receipts tax rate varies throughout the state from 5.125% to 8.6875% with local option taxes imposed at the city and county levels, added to the statewide base tax rate of 5%.
[9]
Oregon
- Oregon levies a Commercial Activity Tax on businesses with more than $1 million of taxable revenue per year. This tax is equal to $250 plus 0.57% of the taxpayer's revenue.
[10]
Ohio
- Ohio imposes a Commercial Activity Tax on businesses with taxable gross receipts of $150,000 or more per year.
[11]
Pennsylvania
- Either 5% or 5.9% for most applicable industries. Tax stands at 1% for private bankers, and the tax on
natural gas
was repealed during the industry's deregulation.
[12]
The City of
Philadelphia
additionally imposes a Business Income and Receipts Tax, a portion of which is based on gross receipts.
[13]
Washington
- Business and Occupation Tax (B&O).
In addition to these states,
Texas
has a "
margin tax
" on certain corporate net revenues.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The versatile
Fran Allison
was heard as a family cousin on
Those Websters
.
Those Websters
was a radio situation comedy series starring
Willard Waterman
and Constance Crowder as George and Jane Webster. The program was launched in New York and then moved to Chicago for a short spell before finishing its run from Hollywood.
The series replaced
That Brewster Boy
(1941-45), which starred a teenaged
Dick York
. Several
Brewster
cast members continued on with
Those Websters
, and the two situation comedies were quite similar. The transition is evident in the near-anagram: Brewster=Webster. In a 1991 interview with John Douglas, Dick York explained how
That Brewster Boy
morphed into
Those Websters
:
Pauline Hopkins and Owen Vincent were the writer and director of
That Brewster Boy
. They were sending bundles to the Communists to help fight the Nazis, so naturally they were branded as Communists. The advertising agency came around, hired everyone from under them, and they were going to change the name of the show and get rid of Pauline and Owen. Well, I was fresh out of the slum. It was the first time I ever had any money, but I went to Pauline and Owen and told them straight out that I didn't know what it was all about, but that I was with them. I wouldn't sign with the agency. Of course, I was taken off the show.
[

Those riotous Websters were heard Friday evenings at 9:30pm on
CBS
from March 9, 1945 to February 22, 1946 with Quaker Oats as the sponsor. On March 3, 1946, the series moved to Mutual where it aired Sundays at 6pm until August 22, 1948.
Cast and characters
[
edit
]
The Webster family lived at 46 River Road in the Chicago suburb of Spring City where George Webster often attended the lodgehall meetings of the Sons of the Mustangs of the Moonlight Mesas. Attempting to prove that "families are fun," those hapless Websters continually encountered confusion, and plans usually went astray during their chaotic misadventures.
Jean Verhagen (later billed as
Jean Hagen
) played Betty Webster.
[1]
The children were Liz Webster (Joan Alt) and Billy Webster (Arthur Young, Gil Stratton Jr.), with
Bill Idelson
as Billy's friend Emil, Jerry Spellman (as Jeep) and Jane Webb (as Belinda Boyd).
Fran Allison
was heard as a family cousin, and the cast also included Clarence Hartzell,
Parley Baer
and
Eddie Firestone Jr.
(1921-2007).
[2]
Charles Irving announced the program, scripted by Priscilla Kent, Albert G. Miller and Frank and Doris Hursley. Frank Worth led the orchestra.
Two years after this series came to an end, Waterman replaced
Harold Peary
as the title character in
The Great Gildersleeve
in 1950.

Views and opinions
[
edit
]
Navon believes that religious Zionism no longer has a single, unifying center of gravity and is facing dramatic processes of ideological change.
[6]
He describes Haredi society as a "victim of its own success. The social and ideological structure that unprecedentedly magnified a small group of several hundred families and created a dizzying success story can no longer maintain tens of thousands of families. The question is how to translate Haredi success into a new communal structure, which will no longer take the form of a closed religious order."
[13]
Navon is critical of the phenomenon of "political correctness" and seeks an alternative based on Jewish values.
[14]
He laments the loss of desire to mirror the religious behavior of one's grandparents, attributing it to an absence of religious self-confidence. He critiques both liberals trying to change religious practice and reactionaries seeking greater stringency.
[15]

. After escaping, he continues using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in the
Cold War
. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.
Major Iron Man stories include
Demon in a Bottle
(1979),
Armor Wars
(1987-1988),
Extremis
(2005), and
Iron Man 2020
(2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories
Civil War
(2006-2007),
Dark Reign
(2008-2009), and
Civil War II
(2016). Iron Man's supporting cast has produced additional superhero characters, including James Rhodes as
War Machine
, Pepper Potts as
Rescue
, and Riri Williams as
Ironheart
as well as reformed villains
Black Widow
and
Hawkeye
. Iron Man's
list of enemies
includes his
archenemy
, the
Mandarin
, as well as many supervillains of
communist
origin and many that double as business rivals for Stark.
Robert Downey Jr.
portrayed
Tony Stark
in
Iron Man
(2008), the first film of the
Marvel Cinematic Universe
, and continued to portray the character until his final appearance in
Avengers: Endgame
(2019). Downey's portrayal popularized the character, elevating Iron Man as one of Marvel's most recognizable superheroes.
Publication history

List of Iron Man titles
Creation and premiere
Following the success of the
Fantastic Four
in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero characters.
[1]
During this time,
Stan Lee
developed the initial concept for Iron Man.
[1]
Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him".
[2]
Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent
arms industry
developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.
[3]
The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".
[4]
As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes. The monster-themed anthology series
Tales of Suspense
began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.
[5]
[6]
Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", was in
Tales of Suspense
#39, released in December 1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964, the science-fiction and horror stories were removed entirely, with the series running only Iron Man and
Captain America
stories.
[6]
Larry Lieber
developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the first Iron Man story, while
Jack Kirby
and
Don Heck
were responsible for the initial design.
[1]
[7]
Kirby initially drew Iron Man as a "round and clunky gray heap", and the design was modified by Heck to incorporate gadgets such as jets, drills, and suction cups. Heck continued as the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel properties.
[5]
[8]
Heck later said that when designing Tony Stark, he was attempting to create "an
Errol Flynn
type".
[9]
Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, it was quickly changed to gold due to issues with printing.
[7]
Lee briefly delegated the writing to other creators at Marvel, but he felt that their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee again took control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.
[10]
1960s
When Marvel's distributor allowed them more monthly releases,
The Avengers
was developed as a new comic book series.
[11]
Iron Man was one of the five characters that formed
the titular superhero team
.
[12]
By 1965, the difficulty of maintaining continuity between
The Avengers
with heroes' solo comics prompted Lee to write the original cast out of
The Avengers
, including Iron Man.
[13]
As part of a shuffling to match artists with the characters they were most suited for,
Steve Ditko
became the artist for
Iron Man
.
[14]
Ditko was responsible for only three issues in late 1963, but in this time he had Iron Man's suit redesigned with the red and gold color scheme that became the character's primary image.
[15]
Iron Man's recurring nemesis, the
Mandarin
, first appeared shortly after in
Tales of Suspense
#50.
[16]
Growing opposition to the
American involvement in Vietnam
prompted a shift in Iron Man's characterization at this time as part of a larger push by Marvel to be more apolitical.
[4]
[17]
Lee shifted the focus of Iron Man stories to espionage and domestic crime, incorporating the intelligence agency
S.H.I.E.L.D.
into these stories. They also incorporated the villains of other Marvel heroes, avoiding Iron Man's primarily communist rogues' gallery. Some of Iron Man's villains were given new motivations without their communist allegiances.
[18]
Previously relegated to short stories in an anthology series, Iron Man was one of several characters to receive a full length dedicated series in 1968.
[19]
The final issues of
Tales of Suspense
and
Sub-Mariner
's
Tales to Astonish
were combined as a
one-shot
special,
Iron Man and Sub-Mariner
.
[20]
Iron Man
then began its run under writer
Archie Goodwin
.
[21]
Political themes were reintroduced slowly over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than geopolitics.
[22]
1970s
I don't feel Tony Stark is a dinosaur, a creature unable to change before the weight of time crushes him aside. Yeah, it is hard in 1977 to praise a millionaire industrialist, playboy and former munitions-manufacturer—but it isn't impossible to change that image. Which is what I plan to do.
Bill Mantlo
,
Iron Man #100
[23]
Over the years, the
letters to the editor
column in several issues saw extensive political debate.
[24]
When Goodwin was made editor-in-chief, assigned
Gerry Conway
as the writer for Iron Man.
[25]
Conway began a four-year-long effort to reform Iron Man in 1971 with stories that directly addressed the character's history as a weapons manufacturer.
[26]
These stories were especially prominent during a run by
Mike Friedrich
, in which corporate reform of Stark Industries was a recurring subplot.
[27]
Iron Man was one of several Marvel characters that declined in popularity during the 1970s, and the series went for a period of time without a dedicated writer until
Bill Mantlo
took over in 1977.
[28]
The following year,
David Michelinie
and
Bob Layton
took charge of the series beginning with issue #116.
[29]
[30]
While inking the series, Layton used issues of
GQ
,
Playboy
, and electronics catalogues as visual references,
[31]
and they stayed informed on developments in real world technology so that the Iron Man armor would always be a more advanced version of what existed.
[30]
Layton was inspired by the vast collection of specialized outfits used by
Batman
when designing Iron Man's various armors.
[32]
In
Iron Man
#117 and #118, Michelinie and Layton replaced many elements that had developed in the series: they removed Iron Man's romantic interest, they removed the
Life Model Decoys
that served as robotic doubles of Tony Stark, and they had him move to a different home.
[33]
Iron Man's new romantic interest,
Bethany Cabe
, was introduced as a feminist character who worked as Tony Stark's bodyguard.
[34]
The largest change they made was making Iron Man an
alcoholic
.
[33]
This was unprecedented for a major comic book hero,
[35]
and for much of popular fiction.
[36]
This began the
Demon in a Bottle
story arc that ran from #120 to #128.
[37]
At the same time, they introduced the character of
Justin Hammer
, who became the main backer of several Iron Man villains.
[38]
1980s and 1990s
The 1980s saw increased focus on Iron Man as a businessman reflecting the economic changes associated with
Reaganomics
, and many of his challenges involved threats to his company.
[39]
Denny O'Neil
was put in charge of
Iron Man
beginning with issue #158. His run explored Tony Stark's psychology, having the character again fall into his alcoholism and suffer at the hands of business rival
Obadiah Stane
.
[32]
O'Neil eventually wrote Tony Stark out of the role entirely, having him temporarily retire as Iron Man and replacing him with his ally
James Rhodes
.
[40]
The 1987
Armor Wars
story arc blends the superhero and businessman aspects of Iron Man more directly when Tony Stark seeks legal recourse for rivals stealing the Iron Man technology.
[39]
Michelinie and Layton returned to the series with issue #211, and they again began experimenting with different variations on the Iron Man armor.
[41]
In 1990, Michelinie and Layton stopped writing for Iron Man, and the series was given to
John Bryne
, one of the most highly regarded comic book writers of the time. His run consisted of three story arcs across twenty issues:
Armor Wars II
(which had already been announced by Michelinie and Layton),
The Dragon Seed Saga
, and
War Games
. He did not have further interest in the series by 1992, as his collaborators
John Romita Jr.
and
Howard Mackie
had moved on to other projects. During his run, Bryne rewrote Iron Man's origin to remove references to communism and the Vietnam War.
[42]
Iron Man's supporting character War Machine was spun off into his own comic book series in 1994.
[43]
As part of a company-wide reorganization, Marvel's major characters, including Iron Man, were given to former Marvel writers
Jim Lee
and
Rob Liefeld
in a profit-sharing agreement. Lee and Liefeld were given charge of the 1996
Heroes Reborn
branding that renumbered Marvel's long-running periodicals at #1.
[44]
This new iteration, labeled volume two, was set in an alternate universe created during the
Onslaught
event. It ran for thirteen issues, written by Lee and
Scott Lobdell
and drawn by
Whilce Portacio
.
[45]
[46]
The following year, Marvel introduced the
Heroes Return
event to bring the characters back from the alternate universe, which again reset characters such as Iron Man to issue #1.
[47]
[48]
This was labeled volume three, which was taken on by writer
Kurt Busiek
and artist
Sean Chen
.
[45]
[49]
21st century
When the
Ultimate Marvel
imprint was created with reimagined versions of Marvel's characters, an
alternate Iron Man
appeared in 2002 with the
Ultimates
, the imprint's adaptation of The Avengers.
[50]
A five issue limited series,
Ultimate Iron Man
, was released featuring this character in 2005.
[51]
In 2004, Iron Man was a major character in the
Avengers Disassembled
event and subsequently became a founding member of
The New Avengers
.
[52]
Volume four of
Iron Man
began in 2005.
[45]
This new run was written by
Warren Ellis
and drawn by
Adi Granov
, and its first story arc,
Extremis
sees Iron Man upgrade his body directly through the Extremis virus, giving him direct control over a biological armor.
[51]
The first fourteen issues of volume four carried the
Iron Man
title, while issues #15-32 were titled
Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
[45]
Iron Man was the leader of the "pro-registration" faction during the 2006
Civil War
crossover event by
Mark Millar
and
Steve McNiven
.
[53]
After the character was rebranded as "Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.", he also appeared with
The Mighty Avengers
in 2007.
[54]
Coinciding with the release of the first
Iron Man
film, Marvel restarted Iron Man's comic book run with
Invincible Iron Man
, written by
Matt Fraction
and drawn by
Salvador Larroca
. This series ran for sixty issues alongside the character's standalone film appearances, ending shortly before
Iron Man 3
was set to be released.
[55]
The series reverted to the original numbering in 2011, when the overall 500th issue was published as
Iron Man
#500.
[45]
Iron Man was then one of several characters whose series was relaunched at issue #1 with the
Marvel Now!
branding following the 2012
Avengers vs. X-Men
event.
[56]
The 2014
AXIS
event led into the
Superior Iron Man
series, featuring an amoral Iron Man.
[57]
Iron Man was again a leader of one faction during the 2016
Civil War II
event by
Brian Michael Bendis
.
[58]
As part of a broader trend by Marvel Comics to substitute its main characters with a diverse cast of original characters in the 2010s, Iron Man was then temporarily replaced by
Ironheart
, an African-American teenage girl who reverse engineered the Iron Man armor.
[59]
At the same time, the series
Infamous Iron Man
was created with
Dr. Doom
becoming Iron Man.
Invincible Iron Man
was renumbered to #593 with the 2017
Marvel Legacy
branding, and this issue reintroduced Tony Stark.
[60]
[61]
The series
Tony Stark: Iron Man
premiered in 2018 with the
Fresh Start
branding, written by
Dan Slott
and drawn by
Valerio Schiti
.
[62]
In 2020, Iron Man was relaunched in a new series, written by
Christopher Cantwell
and illustrated by CAFU, following the
Iron Man 2020
event. This series was written as a "back to basics" project that reverted the character to a more traditional superhero following the developments of previous series.
[63]
The character was relaunched again in 2022 with
Invincible Iron Man
, written by
Gerry Duggan
and illustrated by
Juan Frigeri
.
[64]
Characterization
Fictional character biography
Tales of Suspense
#39 (March 1963): Iron Man debuts. Cover art by
Jack Kirby
and
Don Heck
.
Tales of Suspense
#48 (December 1963), the debut of Iron Man's first red-and-gold suit of armor. Cover art by Jack Kirby and
Sol Brodsky
.
Tony Stark inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, after his parents were killed in a car crash.
[65]
Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands that Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.
[15]
[5]
The war zone that Stark visits has been
changed
multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. For the first decades of Iron Man's publication history, the conflict is the Vietnam War.
[66]
This was changed retroactively in the 1990s to an unnamed Southeast Asian country,
[67]
and a conflict in the fictional country of Siancong was eventually established to justify the inconsistency.
[68]
Iron Man returns to the United States and becomes a superhero, convincing the public that Iron Man is Tony Stark's bodyguard.
[65]
When he is called to stop
Hulk
and learns that
Loki
is behind Hulk's attack, he joins forces with Hulk,
Thor
,
Ant-Man
, and
Wasp
to defeat Loki, and they agree to form a superhero team, the Avengers.
[12]
At the same time, he helps found the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., providing the organization with equipment.
[65]
As Iron Man comes to regret his involvement in weapons manufacturing, Stark Industries is changed to Stark International, an electronics company that emphasizes
environmentalism
and ending
world hunger
.
[69]
[65]
S.H.I.E.L.D. attempts to take over the business and revert it back to weapons manufacturing. At the same time, Iron Man is framed for murder. These stresses cause him to begin drinking heavily, and he develops alcoholism.
[70]
Though he gets sober, he later relapses back into alcoholism as part of a plot by
Obadiah Stane
.
[65]
Iron Man briefly loses his company to Stane, passes the mantle of Iron Man to his ally James Rhodes,
[71]
and becomes homeless.
[72]
After he recovers, Stane adopts an armored suit and becomes the Iron Monger before being defeated. Iron Man then founds a space technology company, Stark Enterprises. When Iron Man learns that
Justin Hammer
had acquired the Iron Man armor's technology, he seeks out all of the other armors.
The resulting fights
leave Iron Man a fugitive, leading him to fake his death and then describe himself as a new Iron Man.
[65]
Iron Man had previously undergone surgery to replace the damaged portions of his heart, eliminating the need for his prosthetic chest plate.
[72]
But when he is shot in the spine and paralyzed, he develops a new prosthesis that grants him mobility. This prosthesis is hacked and controlled remotely, causing neurological damage that appears for a time to kill him.
[73]
During this time,
James Rhodes
takes the Iron Man armor. After returning, Iron Man falls under the control of
Immortus
, turning him evil. The Avengers bring an alternate Tony Stark from another reality to help defeat him. Iron Man is killed, and the alternate Tony Stark becomes the new Iron Man. The original Iron Man and the alternate Iron Man are merged into a single being by
Franklin Richards
when
he rewrites reality
. His company had been bought out, so he starts a consulting firm, Stark Solutions. His secret identity is revealed to the public shortly afterward. He is then appointed
Secretary of Defense
until
Scarlet Witch
alters his mind, causing him to embarrass himself and leave in disgrace.
[65]
When
Mallen
becomes a threat through the Extremis project, Iron Man has himself injected with the Extremis virus, giving him a biological armor that he can control with his mind.
[74]
Iron Man serves as the enforcer of the Superhero Registration Act upon its enactment, creating
a schism
between superheroes, with Iron Man leading proponents of registration against a group of resistors led by
Captain America
.
[53]
At the end of the conflict, Iron Man is appointed head of S.H.I.E.L.D.
[75]
When the Earth is
invaded
by
Skrulls
, S.H.I.E.L.D.
is dismantled
, but Iron Man refuses to turn over the list of registered heroes to its corrupt successor agency
H.A.M.M.E.R.
[76]
This is eventually dismantled as well, and Iron Man organizes the Avengers to replace these intelligence agencies.
[65]
He founds a clean energy company, Stark Resilient, and he fakes his death so his enemies would not threaten it. He joins the
Guardians of the Galaxy
for a time, and upon returning to Earth, he discovers that he had actually been adopted by the Starks so their
real son
could be hidden.
[77]
When a man is discovered who can see the future, the superhero community undergoes
another schism
, and Iron Man leads a team of heroes opposed to a system of predetermined justice using his ability.
[58]
The battle ends with Iron Man in a coma. A reformed
Victor von Doom
becomes Iron Man, while an artificial intelligence backup of Stark's mind guides a new armored superhero, Ironheart, until the technology in Stark's body allows him to heal.
[77]
Personality and motivations
We really thought about how we needed to give him a weakness. It wasn't hip to have him running out of energy and looking for a light socket every few pages, or having a heart attack every time Ultimo was fighting him. So we discussed it and we thought that we would give him the corporate man's disease [alcoholism]. Something that would always haunt him.
Bob Layton
[78]
Iron Man is a businessman and an entrepreneur who constantly seeks to innovate and improve his technology.
[79]
Stan Lee modeled Iron Man after businessman
Howard Hughes
.
[80]
[79]
The character shares many traits with Hughes, including a similar business, his reputation as an arrogant playboy, and a physical resemblance.
[79]
As a businessman, Tony Stark is motivated to create and develop technology both for personal benefit and for the benefit of society.
[81]
[82]
His belief in progress sometimes manifests as opposition to the press and politicians, whose attempts to keep him accountable hamper his efforts as a superhero.
[83]
Iron Man was created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted struggling with real life problems, and his heart injury was an early example of a superhero with a physical disability.
[84]
This injury was prominent in his early characterization, making him misanthropic so as not to reveal the nature of his injury or his
secret identity
,
[8]
thereby threatening his autonomy and his masculinity.
[85]
As real world medical technology made heart injuries less fatal, Iron Man's physical maladies extended to neurological damage.
[86]
Iron Man was given a mental illness as well when he was written as an alcoholic.
[87]
When his stories frequently invoked the Cold War during his first years of publication, Iron Man stood for
liberal capitalism
, fighting against communism in the name of democracy and capitalism.
[88]
In the early 1970s, Iron Man became more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is justified against communism,
[89]
and he responded by becoming a
philanthropist
.
[90]
The 1990s saw Iron Man reject broader ideology in favor of individualism, and his allegiance to American democracy was replaced by his own personal values. He remains anti-communist, however, reiterating his support for democracy and refusing to do business in China following the
Tiannamen Square Massacre
.
[91]
Iron Man is portrayed as an archetype of how masculinity is seen in the United States,
[92]
with his success in business and his playboy characterization allowing the character to symbolize a masculine image of the country during the Cold War.
[93]
This characterization also manifests in negative traits that were prominent in early Iron Man stories, including belligerence, negligence, and misogyny.
[94]
Iron Man prefers machines to humans, believing that machines can be more easily controlled and repaired.
[65]
Writer Dennis O'Neil described the Iron Man armor as "a psychological crutch preventing him from dealing with his own inner demons".
[32]
He identifies with the Iron Man armor as an extension of himself. He believes that the image it presents is his own image, and he considers himself responsible any time someone uses the technology.
[95]
In the 2008 story
The Five Nightmares
, Iron Man narrates his five greatest fears: relapse into alcoholism, reproduction of the Iron Man technology, other people becoming Iron Man, the technology becoming disposable, and that someone else would be distributing this technology. Besides the danger that such scenarios pose, they all represent fear of Iron Man losing power over himself or his technology.
[96]
Themes and motifs
Politics
Iron Man was more overtly political than other Marvel characters of the
Silver Age
.
[97]
Stan Lee wished to create the "quintessential capitalist", developing him as an industrialist that manufactures weapons to fight communism.
[98]
From 1963 to 1968, Iron Man represented capitalism and the United States in allegories for the
Cold War
, particularly in reference to the
Vietnam War
.
[4]
[99]
Though
anti-communist
sentiments were present throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man stories.
[100]
This dynamic allowed Iron Man to examine the perspectives of both the individual inventor and of the bureaucracy of governments and corporations.
[101]
After Marvel shifted away from addressing foreign conflicts, Iron Man was portrayed as a
liberal
who was skeptical of the U.S. government while also opposing
radicalism
associated with the
counterculture of the 1960s
. By 1975, Iron Man was an opponent of the Vietnam War.
[102]
John Bryne's run revisited communism at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, but it was shown as less threatening.
[103]
The absence of Cold War politics was not immediately replaced by another theme, and post-Cold War Iron Man stories often visited different ideas regarding technology for a short time before moving on.
[104]
When
terrorism
became more prominent in the public mind, Iron Man became a symbol of anti-terrorism rather than anti-communism.
[105]
Iron Man was one of the two main characters of the 2006
Civil War
event, an allegory for the
Patriot Act
and
government surveillance
. While Captain America represented liberal opposition to government surveillance in the name of individualism, Iron Man represented conservative support for government surveillance in the name of security.
[106]
In this story, Iron Man represented an attempt to define what a superhero was in the 21st century following the
September 11 attacks
, implicitly likening the fear of terrorism to the fear of unregulated super-powered beings.
[107]
While Marvel was neutral between the characters, readers overwhelmingly saw Iron Man as the villain, being the stronger force that the underdog had to overcome.
[108]
[109]
A second
Civil War
event in 2016 portrayed Iron Man as an advocate of
free will
against Captain Marvel's
determinism
.
[58]
Technology
Technology and its influence on society is a common theme in Iron Man stories,
[110]
[111]
and Iron Man has been emphasized as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances.
[112]
Depictions of technology in Iron Man stories have often endorsed the use of technology to alter the natural world.
[113]
This is in contrast with other Marvel superheroes of the time, when scientific advances—and radiation in particular—are portrayed as having unintended effects.
[82]
[114]
Iron Man's business, Stark Industries, is depicted as a force for good that advances scientific knowledge through capitalist innovation.
[82]
Reflecting his characterization as a businessman, Iron Man stories often invoke themes of
economic competition
, seeing him face characters that try to develop better versions of the Iron Man armor.
[115]
Likewise, many of Iron Man's challenges involve corrupt business rivals and
corporate espionage
.
[103]
The technological nature of the character means that he may also be seen as something that could possibly exist in the real world.
[116]
Iron Man's position within the suit allow for discussion regarding automation versus human oversight of technology.
[117]
These technological themes are explored through a modern lens during the
Extremis
story arc, which incorporates the idea of
human enhancement
through
biotechnology
.
[118]
[119]
Armor
Main article:
Iron Man's armor
The Bleeding Edge Armor, like the Extremis Armor before it, is stored in Stark's bones, and can be assembled and controlled by his thoughts.
In most depictions, Iron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. He instead derives his strength from
powered armor
of his own design.
[120]
In addition to protecting the wearer with its durability, it allows the wearer to fly.
[121]
As of 2010, Marvel Comics described Iron Man's armor as being able to lift 100 tons and to fly at
Mach 8
. The armor is also equipped with various weapons, which typically include
particle beam
"repulsor rays" in each palm that project energy as well as a stronger "unibeam" on his chest.
[76]
From its first appearance, the armor is linked to the brainwaves of the wearer to allow movement.
[122]
It must be calibrated to the user, and Iron Man has to design the armor specifically for who will be using it, whether it be himself or an ally.
[123]
It typically has some method of being shrunk down or made more portable when not being used.
[124]
When it was first developed, the armor was described as using
transistors
to function.
[15]
This was replaced with
integrated circuits
as real world technology advanced.
[125]
Its primary function was to produce a magnetic field that protected his heart from the shrapnel in his body, and his efforts to keep it charged and to keep it secret sometimes drove the story's plot in early years.
[126]
A contrast is made between the armor's strength and the vulnerability of the human inside it.
[127]
[126]
The armor protects Iron Man externally from attacks, but it also protects him internally as it keeps his heart beating.
[122]
This point is emphasized by the form-fitting design of many Iron Man armors, which incorporates a clear human-like element in an otherwise robotic-looking character.
[88]
The armor was gray in its first appearance, but Iron Man gave it gold plating in the subsequent issue, and a few issues thereafter it was replaced by the red and gold look that the character became identified with.
[128]
The character constantly seeks to develop newer, more advanced variations on the armor, and he frequently designs specialized models for specific purposes.
[129]
These include the space armor, the stealth armor, and the deep sea armor,
[130]
as well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the Hulk.
[129]
Developments in the armor's design often reflect real world advances in technology as well as trends in science fiction.
[131]
The use of a technological suit of armor has allowed artists to frequently make changes to the character's appearance without controversy.
[111]
During the
Extremis
story arc, Iron Man developed a biotechnological armor that was embedded in his DNA and stored in his bones, allowing him to summon the armor from within his body and control it with his mind, effectively giving him superhuman abilities. This reduced the
input lag
between him and his armor, allowed him to mentally interface with technology, and gave him the focus to engage in several unrelated tasks at once.
[132]
[133]
The Extremis technology also converted Iron Man's mind into a digital storage device: this allowed him to create a back up of his memories. He uses this back up after wiping his mind to destroy any record of the superhero registry, but he loses access to the Extremis armor in the process. He then develops the similar Bleeding Edge armor based on
nanotechnology
, but he gives this up as well after being unfit to pilot it during a period of alcoholism. He has subsequently used other armors that incorporate nanotechnology.

Main article:
List of Iron Man supporting characters
Pepper Potts is an employee of Stark Industries that Tony Stark promoted to his executive assistant. As he had little interest in running the business, much of the management was handled by her.
[135]
When Stark became Iron Man and began taking responsibility for his company, she taught him how to manage the business.
[65]
When Potts is injured by an explosion and receives a heart injury similar to Iron Man's, he installs the arc reactor technology in her.
[136]
She eventually becomes the CEO of Stark Industries.
[137]
Iron Man built her a set of armor in secret, and after finding it she became the superhero Rescue.
[138]
James Rhodes is an employee of Tony Stark's that became the superhero
War Machine
.
[105]
He first appeared in 1979 and was developed as a supporting character in 1981.
[139]
He briefly took on the role of Iron Man while Tony Stark was relapsing on alcoholism.
[71]
Later on, when Stark was near death, he gave Rhodes his corporation and the War Machine Armor.
[140]
After Stark returned, he had Rhodes keep the armor.
[141]
Rhodes' dependency on Iron Man for his armor often constrains him as a supporting character to Stark, even in solo War Machine stories.
[142]
Happy Hogan
was hired as Tony Stark's chauffeur after saving his life, and Hogan later deduced that Tony Stark was Iron Man.
[143]
Edwin Jarvis
is the butler for the Stark family and for the Avengers. Through Iron Man's membership in the Avengers, he has worked extensively with many of his fellow heroes, including Captain America and Thor, among others.
[144]
His association with S.H.I.E.L.D. sees him working with its agents and leadership, including Nick Fury and
Maria Hill
.
[137]
He has also taken on other heroes as sidekicks, including
Spider-Man
and
Jack of Hearts
.
[65]
Iron Man has had many romantic interests, most of which only last a short time.
[65]
In Iron Man's original
Tales of Suspense
run, a
love triangle
was established in which Tony Stark and Happy Hogan both had romantic interest in Pepper Potts.
[145]
[8]
Hogan eventually married Potts.
[143]
Roxie Gilbert, the sister of the villain Firebrand, was introduced as a romantic interest in the early 1970s. She was a foil for both Iron Man and Firebrand, representing non-violent activism.
[146]
Whitney Frost was Iron Man's romantic interest later in the decade until she turned against him as the villain
Madame Masque
.
[33]
She was replaced by
Bethany Cabe
as part of an overhaul of Iron Man's supporting cast, and Cabe was Iron Man's romantic interest during his alcoholism.
[70]
She left Iron Man after he saved her husband, who had been presumed dead. Iron Man later partnered with
Rumiko Fujikawa
, the daughter of a businessman who took over Stark Enterprises.
[65]
He eventually began a relationship with his long time ally
Janet van Dyne
.
[77]
A story arc in September 2023 saw Iron Man married to
X-Men
member
Emma Frost
.
[147]
Villains
Main article:
List of Iron Man enemies
Iron Man's earliest villains were often affiliated with the Soviet government or otherwise associated with communism.
[148]
In the first three years after Iron Man was created, one-third of his villains were communists.
[149]
Some of these enemies were Soviet counterparts of Iron Man, such as
Titanium Man
[97]
and
Crimson Dynamo
,
[150]
while others were leadership of communist states, such as the
Red Barbarian
and the real-life Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev
.
[148]
Khrushchev, like most communists in the series, was drawn in
caricature
style as a brute who only sought power.
[151]
Multiple communist villains, such as Crimson Dynamo, were reformed and became heroes loyal to the United States to present Iron Man and liberal capitalism as more appealing and morally superior.
[152]
Two prominent Marvel heroes, Soviet spy
Black Widow
[153]
and American street criminal
Hawkeye
, were introduced as Iron Man villains before reforming as heroes.
[13]
The
Mandarin
was introduced as a Chinese villain, initially incorporating racist
Yellow Peril
themes and stereotypes regarding China.
[154]
[155]
Though he is also an allegory for autocracy,
[156]
the Mandarin was not created as another communist villain.
[157]
Instead, any work he does with the Chinese government is purely in self-interest.
[158]
Later on, the Mandarin was retroactively established as the man behind the kidnapping of Tony Stark that created Iron Man.
[67]
The Mandarin contrasts with Iron Man in that he is associated with magic and mysticism rather than science and technology,
[159]
[158]
and in that he was born into nobility unlike Iron Man, who is a
self-made man
in line with American ideals.
[156]
Beginning in the 1970s, Iron Man faced villains that represented social conflict and unrest, such as the anarchist
Firebrand
and the corrupt businessman
Guardsman
.
[160]
Villains representing concerns about technology emerged at the same time, including
Ultimo
.
[161]
The business aspect of Iron Man's character has invited several supervillains who oppose Stark Industries rather than just Iron Man.
[141]
These villains became prominent in the 1980s,
[162]
and they were amplified by the backlash to the decade's consumerism that emerged in the 1990s.
[103]
Some of these villains wish to compete with the corporation and steal trade secrets, such as
Spymaster
,
Whiplash
, and
Beetle
. Others oppose the corporation on ideological grounds, such as
Atom-Smasher
.
[141]
Other such villains include Obadiah Stane,
[71]
Justin Hammer,
[65]
Shockwave
, the
Controller
, the
Mauler
, and
Stilt-Man
.
[162]
A focus on terrorism brought villains such as
Zeke Stane
, who carried out terrorist attacks using
suicide bombers
.
[163]
Alternate versions
Other characters in the
Marvel Universe
have taken on the role of Iron Man besides Tony Stark, including James Rhodes,
[71]
Victor von Doom,
[77]
and Arno Stark.
[164]
Several other versions of Iron Man exist in other universes as part of
Marvel's multiverse
. In the
Ultimate Universe
, an
alternate version of Iron Man
exists as a member of the
Ultimates
, the universe's counterpart of the Avengers.
[165]
Other variations include
Iron Man 2020
, the title of Arno Stark as a future Iron Man; Iron Man 2099, the superhero Sonny Frisco in the year 2099; Lord Iron, who exists in an
Elizabethan society
in the
Marvel 1602
series,
a Tony Stark who operated as
Ant-Man
on Earth-818;
an evil version of Iron Man called Iron Maniac;
a Tony Stark who operates as Iron Lad on Earth-6160; Iron Hammer, a combination of Iron Man and Thor during the
Infinity Warps
event; and Iron Lantern, a combination with
Green Lantern
of
DC Comics
in the
Amalgam
crossover.
[166]
[167]
Cultural impact and legacy
Iron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for his association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War.
[4]
[24]
In response, Marvel rewrote the character to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in the harms caused by war.
[26]
[89]
Iron Man became widely popular following the success of the film
Iron Man
, which made him one of Marvel's most recognizable characters,
[1]
and Iron Man is credited with redefining the
superhero film
genre.
[168]
[169]
The relatively realistic nature of the character and the fact that he had no history of poor adaptations are factors in Iron Man's capacity to renew the interest of general audiences in superhero fiction.
[170]
[171]
Since then, many publishers have listed Iron Man in the top ten in best Marvel character and best superhero lists.
[172]
[173]
[174]
[175]
Iron Man's portrayal of futuristic technology has affected public image of how these technologies may develop. Heavy use of
augmented reality
interfaces by Iron Man, in his helmet's
heads-up display
and elsewhere, has informed public awareness of the technology.
[176]
In 2019, a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was erected in
Forte dei Marmi
, Italy.

ⓘ
) is the
county town
of
East Sussex
, England.
[note 1]
The town is the administrative centre of the wider
district of the same name
and the location of
East Sussex County Council
at
the county hall
.
A traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the
Battle of Lewes
. The town's landmarks include
Lewes Castle
,
Lewes Priory
, Bull House (the former home of
Thomas Paine
), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed
Wealden hall house
known as
Anne of Cleves House
. Other notable features of the area include the
Glyndebourne
festival, the
Lewes Bonfire
celebrations and the
Lewes Pound
.
Etymology
[
edit
]
The place-name 'Lewes' is first attested in an
Anglo-Saxon charter
circa 961 AD, where it appears as
Læwe
. It appears as
Lewes
in the
Domesday Book
of 1086.
[7]
The addition of the <-s> suffix seems to have been part of a broader trend of
Anglo-Norman
scribes pluralising Anglo-Saxon place-names (a famous example being their rendering of
Lunden
as
Londres
, hence the modern
French
name for
London
[8]
).
The traditional derivation of
Læwe
, first posited by the Tudor antiquarian
Laurence Nowell
, derives it from the
Old English language
word
hlæw
, meaning 'hill' or '
barrow
', presumably referring to School Hill (on which the historic centre of Lewes stands) or to one of the five ancient burial mounds, all now levelled, in the vicinity of
St John sub Castro
.
[9]
[10]
However, this etymology has been challenged by the Swedish philologist Rune Forsberg on the grounds that the loss of the initial
⟨h⟩
in
hlæw
would be unlikely
phonologically
in this context. He suggested that the name
Læwe
instead derives from the rare Old English word
lǣw
('wound, incision'), and reflects the fact that from the top of School Hill Lewes overlooks the narrow, steep-sided 'gash' where the
River Ouse
cuts through the line of the
South Downs
.
[11]
This theory was endorsed in 2011 by
A Dictionary of British Place Names
.
[12]
A third possibility has been advanced by
Richard Coates
, who has argued that
Læwe
derives from
lexowia
, an Old English word meaning 'hillside, slope' (of which there is no shortage in the Lewes area). This unusual word was borrowed into Old English from
Old Welsh
, the
Modern Welsh
spelling being
llechwedd
.
[13]
Another possibility, is that the name is connected to
Saint Lewina
(or Lewinna, Levinna, Lewine, Leofwynn; 7th century)
[14]
a British virgin and martyr who was put to death by
Saxon
heathens.
History
[
edit
]
Pre-Saxon
[
edit
]
Lewes is located at the point where the River Ouse flows through a narrow gap in the east-west line of the South Downs. The immense strategic value of the site, which is able to command traffic between the
Channel
coast and the Sussex interior, was recognised as early as the
Iron Age
, when a hill-fort was built on
Mount Caburn
, the steep-sided hill that overlooks the Ouse (and the modern town of Lewes) from the east.
During the
Roman
period there was an aristocratic
villa
at
Beddingham
,
[15]
at the foot of Mount Caburn, and there have been several finds of Roman coins and pottery sherds in Lewes itself. The Victorian historian
Thomas Walker Horsfield
therefore reckoned that there must have been a Roman settlement on the site, and he identified it with the otherwise unlocatable town of
Mutuantonis
.
[16]
Another antiquarian, John Elliot, even suggested that central Lewes's distinctive network of
twittens
was based on the layout of a
Roman legionary fortress
; however modern historians are rather more cautious about the possibility of a Roman Lewes, as there is as yet no archaeological evidence for a built-up area dating back to the Roman period.
[17]
Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman
[
edit
]
The earliest phase of
Anglo-Saxon
settlement in Sussex was concentrated between the Rivers Ouse and
Cuckmere
,
[18]
and Anglo-Saxon finds begin to appear in Lewes from the sixth century.
[19]
The town of Lewes was probably founded around this time, and it may have been one of the most important settlements in the
Kingdom of Sussex
, along with
Chichester
and
Hastings
, though the evidence for this early period is very sketchy.
[20]
Arms of the
de Warenne family
By the ninth century, the Kingdom of Sussex had been annexed to the
Kingdom of Wessex
, and in 838
Ecgberht, King of Wessex
donated the estate of Malling, on the opposite side of the Ouse from Lewes, to the
Archbishop of Canterbury
. As a result, the Parish of Malling became a '
peculiar
', which means that the parish was directly subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury rather than the
Bishop of Chichester
like every other parish in Sussex. Malling would retain this anomalous status until as late as 1845.
[21]
Information about Lewes becomes much more plentiful from the reign of
Alfred the Great
onward, as it was one of the towns which he fortified as part of the network of
burhs
he established in response to the
Viking raids
. The peace and stability brought by Alfred and his successors evidently stimulated economic activity in the area, for in the late Anglo-Saxon period Lewes seems to have been a thriving boom town - during the reign of Alfred's grandson
Æthelstan
it was assigned two royal
moneyers
, more than any other
mint
in Sussex, and according to Domesday Book it generated £26 of revenue for
the Crown
in 1065, almost twice the amount of any other town in the county.
[22]
After the
Norman invasion
,
William the Conqueror
rewarded his retainer
William de Warenne
by making him
Earl of Surrey
and granting him the
Rape of Lewes
, a strip of land stretching along the Ouse valley from the coast to the Surrey boundary. De Warenne constructed
Lewes Castle
within the walls of the Saxon
burh
, while his wife
Gundreda
founded the
Priory of St Pancras
, a
Cluniac
monastic house, in about 1081.
Battle of Lewes
[
edit
]
Main article:
Battle of Lewes
During the
Second Barons' War
,
King Henry III
was ambushed at Lewes by a force of rebel barons led by
Simon de Montfort
. Henry marched out to fight de Montfort, leading to a pitched battle on the hills above the town (roughly in the area of modern Landport Bottom). The king's son
Prince Edward
, commanding the right wing of the royal army, succeeded in driving off some of the baronial forces, but he got carried away with the pursuit, which took him as far as
Offham
. In Edward's absence the remainder of the royal army was attacked by de Montfort and
Gilbert de Clare
and decisively defeated. The king's brother
Richard of Cornwall
was captured, and the king himself was forced to sign the
Mise of Lewes
, a document which does not survive but was probably aimed at forcing Henry to uphold the
Provisions of Oxford
. Despite this uncertainty about its consequences, the battle is often seen as an important milestone in the development of English democracy.
[23]
[24]
Late Mediaeval and Early Modern
[
edit
]
Arms of the
Fitzalan family
The
de Warenne family
died out with
Earl John
in 1347, whereupon lordship of the
Rape of Lewes
passed to his sororal nephew
Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel
. Fitzalan preferred to reside at
Arundel Castle
rather than at Lewes, and the town therefore lost the prestige and economic advantages associated with being the seat of an important magnate. This was only the beginning of a series of misfortunes that struck Lewes, for in 1348 the
Black Death
arrived in England and later on in the century the
Hundred Years War
led to a series of French and
Castilian
raids on Sussex,
[25]
[26]
which badly disrupted trade. On one occasion in 1377 the
Prior
of
St Pancras
, John de Charlieu, was abducted by the raiders and held to ransom. Furthermore, after the main branch of the Fitzalan family died out in 1439, the Rape of Lewes was subsequently partitioned between the three sororal nephews of the
last earl
, namely
John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk
,
Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny
, and Edmund Lenthall. As a result of this dismemberment the district became even more neglected by its lords, although feudal politics was starting to become less important anyway due to the centralising reforms of the
Yorkist
and
Tudor
kings.
[25]
The
English Reformation
was begun by one of these Tudor monarchs,
Henry VIII
, and as part of this process the
monasteries of England were dissolved
;
Lewes Priory
was consequently demolished in 1538 and its property seized by the Crown. Henry's daughter
Mary I
reversed the religious policy of England, and during the resulting
Marian Persecutions
of 1555-1557, Lewes was the site of the execution of seventeen
Protestant
martyrs
, most of them actually from the
Weald
rather than Lewes itself, who were burned at the stake in front of the Star Inn (now the site of
Lewes Town Hall
). Commemoration of the martyrs is one of the main purposes of
Lewes Bonfire
, and a stone memorial to the martyrs was unveiled on
Cliffe Hill
in 1901.
[27]
Lewesian politics was dominated by a strongly
Puritan
faction in the reign of
Charles I
, and during the
English Civil War
it was one of the most important
Parliamentarian
strongholds in Sussex. As such it became the target of a
royalist
attack in December 1642, but the royalist army was intercepted and defeated at the
Battle of Muster Green
by Parliamentarian forces commanded by
Herbert Morley
, one of the two
Members of Parliament
(MPs) for Lewes.
[28]
Lewes recovered relatively quickly after the Civil War, and prospered during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It had always been one of the principal market towns of Sussex, as well as an important port, and by the end of the
Georgian era
it also had well-developed textiles, iron, brewing, and shipbuilding industries.
[28]
Modern
[
edit
]
The severe winter of 1836-7 led to a large build-up of snow on Cliffe Hill, whose sheer western face directly overlooks the town. On Tuesday 27 December 1836 this
snow cornice
collapsed, and the resulting
Lewes avalanche
was the deadliest ever recorded in Britain. The avalanche struck the cottages on Boulters Row (now part of South Street), burying fifteen people, of whom eight died. A
pub
in South Street is named
The Snowdrop
in memory of the event.
In 1846 the town became a railway junction, with lines constructed from the north, south and east to two railway stations. The development of
Newhaven
ended Lewes's period as a major port.
[29]
During the
Crimean War
, some 300 Finns who had served in the Russian army during the
Åland War
and been captured at
Bomarsund
were imprisoned in the naval prison at Lewes.
[30]
Lewes became a
borough
in 1881. Lewes Town Hall opened in 1893 in premises converted from the former Star Inn and in 1913 Council Offices were added in Arts-and-Crafts style.
[31]
Lewes Victoria Hospital
opened in 1909 in its current premises, as Victoria Hospital and Infirmary, having previously been on School Hill where it opened as the Lewes Dispensary and Infirmary in 1855.
In October 2000 the town suffered major
flooding
during an intense period of severe weather throughout the United Kingdom. The commercial centre of the town and many residential areas were devastated. In a government report into the nationwide flooding, Lewes was officially noted the most severely affected location.
[32]
As a result of the devastation, the Lewes Flood Action group formed, to press for better flood protection measures.
[33]
Governance
[
edit
]
Lewes Town Hall
Local government
[
edit
]
There are three tiers of local government covering Lewes, at
parish
(town),
district
and
county
level: Lewes Town Council,
Lewes District Council
and
East Sussex County Council
. The town council is based at
Lewes Town Hall
on the High Street.
[34]
The county council has its headquarters at
County Hall
on St Anne's Crescent in the town, which is also used by Lewes District Council as its meeting place.
[35]
Lewes was an
ancient borough
, although the structure of its early government is obscure. For much of the Middle Ages the town was run by a closed aristocratic organisation known as the "Fellowship of the Twelve", which was gradually eclipsed by a body known as the jury in the seventeenth century, presided over by a constable. The limitations of the town's administration were recognised in 1806 when separate
improvement commissioners
were established to pave, light and repair the streets and provide a
watch
. When local government in towns was reformed across the country in the 1830s, Lewes was one of the boroughs
left unreformed
, and so it continued to be run by its jury and improvement commissioners. The situation was finally regularised in 1881 when the town was made a
municipal borough
. The town was then run by a corporate body formally called the "mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Lewes", informally known as the corporation or town council. The last constable became the first mayor.
[36]
[37]
In 1890 the town council acquired the former Star Inn at 189 High Street, parts of which date back to the fourteenth century, and the adjoining corn exchange. The buildings were converted and extended to become the town hall, including a new frontage to High Street, which was completed in 1893.
[38]
The municipal borough of Lewes was abolished in 1974 when the larger Lewes District was established.
[39]
A
successor parish
was created covering the area of the former borough, with the parish council taking the name Lewes Town Council.
[40]
Following the 2023 election the composition of the town council was:
[41]
Party
Councillors
Green
12
Liberal Democrats
5
Labour
1
Total
18
The next election is due in 2027.
Since 2010 the town has been included within the
South Downs National Park
. The National Park Authority has therefore taken over some functions from the local councils, notably relating to
town planning
.
[42]
Constituency
[
edit
]
Lewes gives its name to the
Lewes parliamentary constituency
. The constituency was held by the Conservatives from the 1870s until 1997 when it was won by Liberal Democrat
Norman Baker
. He held the seat for 18 years until defeated in 2015 by Conservative
Maria Caulfield
who retained her seat in the 2017 and 2019 general elections.
Geography
[

You can see Lewes lying like a box of toys under a great amphitheatre of chalk hills ... on the whole it is set down better than any town I have seen in England.

(1834-1896)
Panoramic view of Lewes
Lewes is situated on the
Greenwich
or
Prime Meridian
,
[43]
in a gap in the
South Downs
, cut through by the
River Ouse
, and near its confluence with the Winterbourne Stream. It is approximately seven miles north of
Newhaven
, and an equal distance north-east of
Brighton
.
The South Downs rise above the river on both banks. The High Street, and earliest settlement, occupies the west bank, climbing steeply up from the bridge taking its ancient route along the ridge; the summit on that side, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) distant is known as Mount Harry. On the east bank there is a large
chalk
cliff
,
Cliffe Hill
that can be seen for many miles, part of the group of hills including
Mount Caburn
, Malling Down (where there are a few houses in a wooded area on the hillside, in a development known as Cuilfail) and Golf Hill (home to the Lewes Golf Club). The two banks of the river are joined by Willey's Bridge (a footbridge), the Phoenix Causeway (a recent concrete road bridge, named after the old Phoenix Ironworks) and Cliffe Bridge (an 18th-century replacement of the
mediaeval
crossing, widened in the 1930s and now semi-pedestrianised).
The High Street runs from Eastgate to West-Out, forming the spine of the ancient town. Cliffe Hill gives its name to the one-time village of Cliffe, now part of the town. The southern part of the town, Southover, came into being as a village adjacent to the Priory, south of the Winterbourne Stream. At the north of the town's original wall boundary is the St John's or Pells area, home to several 19th-century streets and the Pells Pond. The
Pells Pool
, built in 1860, is the oldest freshwater
lido
in England. The Phoenix Industrial Estate lies along the west bank of the river and contains a number of light industrial and creative industry uses, as well as car parks and a fire station. A potential regeneration project (formerly "The North Street Quarter", renamed "The Phoenix Project" by the Lewes-based eco-development company Human Nature which took on ownership of the land in December 2020) for the area would be the largest in Lewes since the South Malling residential area was developed in the 1950s and 1960s and in the South Downs since it became a National Park.
[44]
[45]
Malling lies to the east of the river and had 18th- and 19th-century houses and two notable breweries. Road engineering and local planning policy in the 1970s cleared many older buildings here to allow the flow of traffic; the main road route east from the town now goes along Little East Street, across the Phoenix Bridge and through the Cuilfail Tunnel to join the A27.
The town boundaries were enlarged twice (from the original town walls), in 1881 and 1934. They now include the more modern housing estates of Wallands, South Malling (the west part of which is a previously separate village with a church dedicated to St Michael), Nevill, Lansdown and Cranedown on the Kingston Road.
[46]
Countryside walks can be taken starting from several points in Lewes.
[47]
One can walk on Mount Caburn to the village of
Glynde
starting in Cliffe, traverse the
Lewes Brooks
(an
RSPB
reserve) from Southover, walk to
Kingston near Lewes
also from Southover, head up Landport Bottom to Mount Harry and
Black Cap
along the edge of the old Lewes Racecourse, or wander up along the Ouse to
Hamsey Place
from the Pells. The
South Downs Way
crosses the Ouse just south of Lewes at Southease and hikers often stop off at the town. A new route reaching the town at the
Railway Land
- the Egrets Way - initially conceived in 2011 by the Ouse Valley Cycle Network, has been designed as a network of walking and cycling paths linking Lewes and Newhaven with the villages in between.
[48]
Natural sites
[
edit
]
Three
Sites of Special Scientific Interest
lie within the parish:
Lewes Downs
,
Lewes Brooks
and
Southerham Works Pit
. Lewes Downs is a site of
biological
interest, an isolated area of the South Downs.
[49]
Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, is part of the floodplain of the
River Ouse
, providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails.
[50]
Southerham Works Pit is of
geological
interest, a disused
chalk
pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains.
[51]
The Railway Land nature reserve is on the east side of the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted reed bed designed by local land artist
Chris Drury
.
[52]
The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in
East Sussex
and
Kent
home to the
marsh frog
, an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.
[53]
On 21 August 1864, Lewes experienced an
earthquake
measuring 3.1 on the
Richter magnitude scale
.

List of places of worship in Lewes District
Church of England
[
edit
]
St Michael's is located at the top of the High Street and like St Peter's in nearby
Southease
it has a round tower (with a shingled spire). Its length runs along the street rather than away from it and the cemetery is separated from the High Street by stone walls with iron railings on top. Next to it is a building which is used upstairs as a
Sunday school
.
Further west is St Anne's,
[56]
a quiet church surrounded by its graveyard, which gives its name to the street it is on.
St John sub Castro
(
Latin
for St John-under-the-Castle) is the northernmost church in the old town. The surrounding town quarter is called St John's. The church's boundaries are actually protected on one side by the Town Walls, although originally St John's was a small
Saxon
building. It was destroyed in the 19th century but the main door was kept and used as an east door for the large new church, built in 1839 by George Cheeseman
[57]
in
flint
and
brick
. In the graveyard there is a
memorial to the Finnish prisoners
kept in the old naval prison in the 19th century. St John's Church Hall is a couple of streets away in Talbot Terrace.
In Cliffe there is St Thomas à Becket's, where the
Orthodox
Community also worship.
In Southover, St John the Baptist's is located on Southover High Street. The nave incorporates the
hospitium
of the
.
[58]
Neighbouring it is Church End and down the road at St James Street
cul-de-sac
, the Church Hall. In its grounds is the Southover War Memorial, which is distinct from the main
Lewes War Memorial
.
St. Michael,
South Malling
, dates from 1628.
Deconsecrated
[
edit
]
All Saints' is next to the site of a
Priory
of
Grey Friars
(
Franciscan
friars) the only relic of which is an archway at the end of the church boundary wall, which is on the line of the town wall. The medieval tower survives, abutting a later brick nave by
Amon Wilds
(1806)
[57]
and 19th-century Gothic-style chancel. This church is now deconsecrated and serves as a community arts space, managed by the Town Council.
[59]
Roman Catholic
[
edit
]
The
Roman Catholic
church is dedicated to
St. Pancras
in memory of the Priory and is a red-brick building over the street from St Anne's.
Non-conformist
[
edit
]
The
Religious Society of Friends
(finished 1784) is a Quaker meeting house next to the former All Saints' Church (now an arts centre) on Friar's Walk.
The
Jireh Chapel
, off Malling Street, is a Grade I listed building,
[60]
being a rare survivor of its type dating from 1805. It now houses the
Lewes Free Presbyterian Church
.
Westgate Chapel is a 16th-century building located built on the original 13th century town wall foundations and a yard at the top of the High Street (Grade 2* listed). So called because of its position at the old West Gate of the town wall, the Chapel was in use during the 17th century and became a licensed place of worship named as Westgate Meeting on 5th November 1700 and recorded as Independent. Its liberal stance allowed it to become a
Unitarian
led church by 1820 (when the congregation of
Southover General Baptist Chapel
re-joined) It is now an Independent chapel.
Eastgate Chapel is a very different building; a neo-Norman design of 1843 in dark flint, it originally had a pepper-pot dome but this was removed in favour of a traditional spire in case traffic vibrations below made it fall off. A modern extension has been added to the church.
Christ Church, a modern (1953) building, serves a united congregation of
United Reformed Church
and
Methodist
worshippers.
Southover General Baptist Chapel
was built in Eastport Lane in 1741. The congregation's views moved towards Unitarianism, and in the 19th century they re-joined Westgate Chapel having earlier split from there. The building has been a house since 1972, but had various religious and secular uses before that.
Demography
[
edit
]
In 2001 the service industries were by far the biggest employers in Lewes: over 60% of the population working in that sector. A little over 10% are employed in manufacturing, mostly in the smaller industrial units.
The town is a net daytime exporter of employees with a significant community working in London and Brighton whilst it draws in employees of the numerous local government and public service functions on which its local economy is strongly dependent.
An important part of the town's economy is based on tourism,
[61]
because of the town's many historic attractions and its location.
As referenced in the governance section, the town is also where three tiers of local government have their headquarters, and the head office of
Sussex Police
is also in Lewes.
[62]
Lewes Bonfire
[
edit
]
Procession of the martyrs' crosses, as part of Lewes'
Bonfire Night
celebrations
Main article:
Lewes Bonfire
The town's most important annual event is the
Lewes Bonfire
celebrations on 5 November,
Guy Fawkes Night
. In Lewes this event not only marks the date of the uncovering of the
Gunpowder Plot
in 1605, but also commemorates the memory of the seventeen Protestant martyrs
burnt at the stake
for their faith during the
Marian Persecutions
. The celebrations, which controversially involve burning an effigy of
Pope Paul V
, who was pope during the Gunpowder Plot, are the largest and most famous
Bonfire Night
celebrations in the country.
[63]
[64]
Economy
[
edit
]
Harveys Brewery
in the centre of Lewes
The Lewes Chamber of Commerce represents the traders and businesses of the town.
[65]
The town has been identified as unusually diversified with numerous specialist, independent retailers, counter to national trends toward 'chain' retailers and large corporate retail outlets.
Lewes Farmers' Market, one of the first in the UK, was started in the 1990s by Common Cause Co-operative Ltd
[66]
and is a popular re-invention of Lewes as a market town. The Farmers' Market takes place in pedestrianised Cliffe High Street on the first and third Saturdays of every month, with local food producers coming to sell their wares under covered market stalls. A weekly food market in the Lewes Market Tower was established in July 2010 by Transition Town Lewes to allow traders to sell local produce. Occasionally French traders from the
twin town
of
Blois
attend, vending on Cliffe Bridge.
From 1794 beers, wines and spirits were distributed from Lewes under the
Harveys
name, and the town is today the site of
Harvey & Son
's brewery celebrated as one of the finest ale producers in England.
In September 2008, Lewes launched its own currency, the
Lewes Pound
, in an effort to increase trade within the town.
[67]
[68]
One Lewes Pound is equal to £1. Like the similar
local currency
in
Totnes
, the initiative is part of the
Transition Towns
movement. The Lewes Pound and the
Transition Towns
movement have received criticism for a failure to address the needs of the wider Lewes population, especially lower socio-economic groups.
[69]
Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticised in light of limited success stimulating new spending in local economies and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions.
[70]
The Lewes Pound can be exchanged for the same amount of
pounds sterling
in several shops in Lewes and can be spent in a wide range of local businesses. Many of the notes were sold on
eBay
at a higher amount. Early numbers and sequenced notes fetched very high prices from foreign collectors.
Landmarks
[
edit
]
Lewes Castle
The town is the location of several significant historic buildings, including
Lewes Castle
, the remains of
Lewes Priory
, Bull House (the former home of
Thomas Paine
),
Southover Grange
and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed
Wealden hall house
known as
Anne of Cleves House
because it was given to her as part of her divorce settlement from
Henry VIII
, though she never lived there. Anne of Cleves House and the castle are owned and maintained by the
Sussex Archaeological Society
(whose headquarters are in Lewes). The Round House, a secluded former
windmill
in Pipe Passage, was owned by the writer
Virginia Woolf
.
The steep and cobbled Keere Street is home to many historic buildings, including a
timber framed
antiquarian bookshop. The gardens of the buildings on the east side of the street border the old Town Walls. The
Prince Regent
once drove his
carriage
down the street, and a sign at the bottom commemorates this event.
The Fifteenth Century Bookshop, on the corner of High Street and Keere Street
The ancient street pattern survives extensively as do a high proportion of the medieval building plots and oak framed houses, albeit often masked with later facades. The 18th-century frontages are notable and include several, like Bartholomew House at the Castle Gate, that are clad in
mathematical tiles
which mimic fine brick construction. Numerous streets of 18th- and 19th-century cottages have survived cycles of
slum clearance
as models of attractive town housing.
At the highest point of the old town the
Portland stone
and
Coade stone
facade of the
Crown Court
(1808-12, by
John Johnson
), the brick Market Tower and florid
Lewes War Memorial
mark the historic centre, although trade has tended to concentrate on the lower land in modern times. At the lowest part of the town, by the river,
Harvey & Son
's Brewery, 'The Cathedral of Lewes' is an unspoilt 19th-century tower brewery and is the only one of the town's five original major breweries still in use. Nearby
Fitzroy House
is a
George Gilbert Scott
designed building, constructed as a library in memory of Lewes MP
Henry FitzRoy
in 1862 and now a private residence.
[71]
The railway station is the other important monument of the industrial era.
Bull House:
Thomas Paine
's home
Southover Grange
is a
grade II*listed
Tudor manor house built in 1572 with
Caen limestone
taken from the ruins of
Lewes Priory
.
[72]
The house and its gardens were bought by Lewes District Council and opened to the public in 1945. The house is now owned by
East Sussex County Council
, and it is currently being refurbished into a wedding venue, registry office and community facility. The east wing is leased to an art shop and the Window café (open in spring and summer). The Grange gardens are divided by the Winterbourne stream and contain formal bedding displays, a wildflower area, a knot garden and some notable trees, including a large
Magnolia grandiflora
, a
mulberry tree
dating perhaps to the 17th century and a
tulip tree
planted by
Queen Elizabeth II
. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours all year round.
Keere Street
Pelham House dates back to the 16th century and features architecture of all subsequent eras and a private landscaped garden facing the Downs. It now serves as an independent hotel. The Shelleys, also now a hotel, is likewise of some antiquity with a private garden and family associations with
Percy Shelley
.
The centre of Lewes is notable for a consistently high calibre of regional vernacular architecture and variety of historic construction materials and techniques. A comprehensive survey of all historical plaques was conducted in 2013 by a local civic society, the Friends of Lewes.
[73]
A distinctive feature of the centre of Lewes is the network of alleyways or 'twittens' which run north-south on either side of the High Street and date back to Anglo-Saxon times. According to the Dictionary of the Sussex dialect and collection of provincialisms in use in the county of Sussex published in Lewes in 1875. "Twitten is a narrow path between two walls or hedges, especially on hills. For example, small passageways leading between two buildings to courtyards, streets, or open areas behind". Some twittens (e.g. Broomans Lane, Church Twitten, Green Lane, Paine's Twitten) remain flint-wall-lined pedestrian thoroughfares, others (e.g. Watergate Lane, St Andrew's Lane and renamed Station Street (formerly St Mary's Lane)) are now narrow usually one-way roads. The most notable of all Lewes' twittens is Keere Street. A weekly Sunday morning run up and down all the twittens on the south side of the High Street - the so-called Twitten Run - has operated in the town since November 2015.

Historic
[
edit
]
With
Eric Gill
's move to Ditchling, the artistic community there gave rise to other sculptors in the Lewes district such as his nephew
John Skelton
and
Joseph Cribb
. Skelton's studio in
Streat
has continued as an educational and artist's workshop since his death in 1999.
[75]
Eric Gill
and
Jacob Epstein
conceived
a great scheme for doing some colossal figures together
around 1910 for a modern Stonehenge on 6 acres of land at Asheham House,
Beddingham
, south-east of Lewes.
William Rothenstein
agreed to buy the lease but the scheme failed.
[76]
Edward Perry Warren
first saw Lewes House in 1889 and with his partner John Marshall they were prodigious collectors of fine antique sculpture there.
Eric Gill
was introduced to Warren by
Roger Fry
and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which is now in the
Tate Gallery
collection.
William Rothenstein
suggested that Warren might like to acquire
Rodin
's new sculpture
The Kiss
and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes
Kiss
arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend
The Kiss
to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time.
The Kiss
was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915,
The Kiss
was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, saying only that the room did 'not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.' On 26 February 1917,
The Kiss
was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren's death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham,
The Kiss
was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and is now one of the Tate's most popular attractions.
It returned on loan to Lewes in 1999 for the exhibition
Rodin in Lewes
.

Transport
[
edit
]
Lewes railway station
, looking east. South Downs in the distance
Lewes, from its inception, has been an important transport hub.
[82]
Its site as a bridging point was probably originally a ford: today the main routes avoid the town centre. The
A27 trunk road
taking traffic along the south coast between
Eastbourne
and
Southampton
passes to the south of the town. The
A26
from
Maidstone
to Newhaven; and the
A275
(the London road) both come in from the north. The
Brighton & Hove
bus company and Compass Travel serve the town.
The bus station
was closed for a while but reopened in late 2008.
Lewes railway station
was originally the junction for six routes. The town still enjoys hourly fast trains from London. The two erstwhile rural rail routes to the north, linking to
East Grinstead
and
Uckfield
respectively, are both now closed, but the
East Coastway Line
, connecting Brighton with Eastbourne and
Hastings
, and the branch to
Seaford
remain.
The
Vanguard Way
, a
long-distance footpath
from London to Newhaven, passes through countryside east of the town. The
South Downs Way
also passes close to Lewes, crossing the Ouse at
Southease
, some four miles south of the town. The
Greenwich Meridian Trail
, a long-distance path that follows the
Greenwich Meridian
from Peacehaven in East Sussex to Sand le Mere in East Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town. A festival celebrating and encouraging walking and cycling, the Lewes Hike and Bike Festival, was created in 2012 but only ran for three years.
[83]
The Eastbourne and Lewes Walking Festival was created in 2018 to promote walking in the local urban and rural South Downs area.
[84]

List of episodes
The
twenty-first season
of
Saturday Night Live
, an American
sketch comedy
series, originally aired in the United States on
NBC
between September 30, 1995, and May 18, 1996.
History
[
edit
]
The season was home to the
Rage Against the Machine
incident. On April 13, 1996, the band was the musical guest, and was scheduled to perform two songs. The show was hosted that night by ex-
Republican
presidential candidate and billionaire
Steve Forbes
. According to RATM guitarist
Tom Morello
, "RATM wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his
flat tax
by making our own statement."
[1]
To this end, the band hung two upside-down
American flags
from their amplifiers. Seconds before they took the stage to perform "
Bulls on Parade
",
SNL
and NBC sent stagehands in to pull the flags down.
[2]
Following the removal of the flags during the first performance, the band was approached by
SNL
and NBC officials and ordered to immediately leave the building. Upon hearing this, bassist
Tim Commerford
reportedly stormed Forbes's dressing room, throwing shreds from one of the torn down flags.
Morello noted that members of the
Saturday Night Live
cast and crew, whom he declined to name, "expressed solidarity with our actions, and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance."

Chemical compound
Acetyllysine
(or acetylated lysine) is an
acetyl
-derivative of the
amino acid
lysine
. There are multiple forms of acetyllysine: this article is about
N
-ε-acetyl-
L
-lysine; the other form is
N
-α-acetyl-
L
-lysine.
In
proteins
, the
acetylation
of lysine residues is an important mechanism of
epigenetics
.  It functions by regulating the binding of
histones
to
DNA
in
nucleosomes
and thereby controlling the expression of genes on that DNA.  Non-histone proteins are acetylated as well.  Unlike the functionally similar
methyllysine
, acetyllysine does not carry a positive charge on its side chain.
Histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) catalyze the addition of acetyl groups from
acetyl-CoA
onto certain lysine residues of histones and non-histone proteins.
Histone deacetylases
(HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from acetylated lysines.
Acetyllysine can be synthesized from lysine by the selective
acetylation
of the terminal amine group.

Cache Valley
(
Shoshoni
:
Seuhubeogoi
, “Willow Valley”)
is a valley of northern
Utah
and southeast
Idaho
, United States, that includes the
Logan metropolitan area
.
[1]
The valley was used by
19th century mountain men
and was the site of the 1863
Bear River Massacre
. The name, Cache Valley is often used synonymously to describe the Logan Metropolitan Area, one of the fastest growing metro areas in the US per capita — both in terms of economic GDP and population.
History
[
edit
]
View across Cache Valley from
North Logan
,
Utah
, June 2009
Alongside habitation by the
Shoshone
and other
indigenous peoples
, European explorer Michel Bourdon discovered Cache Valley
c.
1818 during a
MacKenzie fur expedition
.  The valley was subsequently used for the second of the annual gatherings of
mountain men
.
[2]
Many of the trappers who worked in the valley came from the Hudson's Bay Company, the Northwest Fur Company, and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.
[3]
The name "Cache Valley" was derived by the
fur trappers
who hid their trading goods in
caches
in that region.
[4]
The use of caches was a method used by fur traders to protect their goods from theft and damage.
[5]
[6]
Mormon
William Gardner
became the first Anglo-American permanent settler in 1852. Prior to the Mormon selection of the
Salt Lake Valley
,
Jim Bridger
had recommended Cache Valley due to its relative abundance of fresh water.  A Mormon settler group led by
Peter Maughan
arrived via
Box Elder Canyon
(commonly referred to as Sardine Canyon) in July 1856 and additional settlers arrived on September 15.
Early Anglo-American settlers of Cache Valley were able to defend themselves from the threat of Native Americans by creating the Cache Valley Militia. Men from the various towns in Cache Valley nicknamed "minute men" volunteered to drill, serve as watchmen, and to ride to the aid of other communities at the news of attacks and skirmishes.
[5]
On January 29, 1863, an expedition from
Camp Douglas
, Utah to Cache Valley, the
United States Army
at the request of Cache Valley settlers attacked a
Shoshone
village in the early morning at the confluence of the
Bear River
and Beaver Creek (now
Battle Creek
) in what became known as the
Bear River Massacre
.
[7]
[8]
Officially, numbers of Shoshone dead have varied, but estimates settle around 400-500 dead, including hundreds of women and children.
[8]
This is still the largest massacre of Native American peoples by the United States government today.

A:
The DPS has been a
catch-all party
since its formation
[4]
[5]
but had been described as
left-wing
until 1997,
[6]
and after that as
centre-left
[7]
[8]
or
centrist
,
[9]
with some factions which are
right-wing
,
populist
and
nationalist
.

[11]
The
Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro
(
Montenegrin
:
Демократска партија социјалиста Црне Горе
,
romanized
:
Demokratska partija socijalista Crne Gore
,
DPS
) is a
social-democratic
[12]
[13]
and
populist
[14]
political party in Montenegro
.
[15]
A former long-time
ruling party
sitting at the
opposition
for the first time as of 2020, it was formed on 22 June 1991 as the successor of the
League of Communists of Montenegro
, which had governed Montenegro within the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
since
World War II
, and has remained a major force in the country ever since. The party is a member of the
Socialist International
[16]
and the
Progressive Alliance
,
[17]
and an associate of the
Party of European Socialists
. During the 1990s, DPS was the major
centre-left
,
social-democratic
party in favour of
Serbian-Montenegrin unionism
. However, since 1997, the party has embraced
Montenegrin independence
and has been improving ties with the West, slowly turning into a
catch-all party
embracing
Atlanticism
,
[18]
Montenegrin nationalism
,
[14]
[19]
neoliberalism
,
[20]
[21]
[22]
and
pro-Europeanism
.
[23]
[24]
Since its formation and the introduction of a
multi-party system
, the DPS has played a dominant role in Montenegrin politics, forming the backbone of every coalition government until the
2020 parliamentary election
, when it entered the opposition. This marked the first time since 1945 that the party, including its predecessor incarnation, had not been in power.
[25]
Prior to the 2020 election, the party strongly supported the controversial
religious freedom law
, causing tensions across Montenegro and the rise of the
Serbian Orthodox Church
in Montenegrin politics.
[26]
The Church gaining more power gave motivation for the ethnic nationalist faction to rise in the party, with which some members such as the civic nationalist
Filip Vujanović
had issues since 2011.
[27]
[28]
The ethnic nationalist wing of the party also supported renewing the
Montenegrin Orthodox Church
, which led to the DPS being accused of creating a "party church".
[29]
[30]
Ideology
[
edit
]
The party evolved from the
League of Communists of Montenegro
as a reformist force after Yugoslavia's dissolution. In the 1990s, party was based on
democratic socialism
,
social democracy
, and
Serbian-Montenegrin unionism
. In the 2000s, the party switched policy towards a common state with Serbia and would become the main proponent of the independence of Montenegro in 2006. In the 2010s and 2020s, the party is characterized by
populist
,
[14]
big tent
politics with a slight
centre-left
lean,
[31]
alongside elements of
nationalism
[32]
and a
pro-European
stance towards
European integration
.
[23]
The PDS also followed most mainstream, centre-left, social-democratic parties moving to the right since the 1980s, as a result of the
post-war displacement of Keynesianism
, by embracing
Third Way
economics and politics but has been described as one of the most radical
neoliberal
centre-left parties.
[20]
Many considered the party and its three decades rule to have been in practice a
kleptocratic
and
authoritarian
regime.
[33]
[34]
[35]
[36]
[37]
After its ninth congress in November 2019, the DPS dominantly increased its ethnic
Montenegrin nationalist
discourse by officially and institutionally supporting the rights of the canonically unrecognized Montenegrin Orthodox Church, announcing its "re-establishment".
[38]
According to the
ODIHR
and
Freedom House
reports that the party established a
hybrid regime
as well an
electoral authoritarian
system. After the fall of its populist regime from the position of power after 30 years due to results of the
2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election
, the party said that the
Krivokapić Cabinet
, a big tent ruling coalition, represents "threat for Montenegrin statehood and its independence". The period before the 2020 parliamentary election was marked by the high polarization of the electorate. Several corruption scandals of the ruling party triggered
2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests
, while a controversial
religion law
sparked another
wave of protests
.
Election monitoring
observer
OSCE
stated that "[a]buse of state resources gave the
ruling party
an unfair advantage" and of inciting ethnic hatred, and said that although the elections were competitive, the governing party also benefited from a lack of
independent media
.
[39]
In foreign policy, the party maintains Atlanticist and Europeanist positions, condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine and positioning itself in an anti-Russian role.
[40]
[41]
According to some analysts, the DPS, together with its coallition partners, as well some newly founded nationalist parties, started pushing the narrative of "Montenegro being left to Serbia by the
United States
and the
EU
", but these assessments have no foundation in the post-Ukrainian invasion international scenario.

History

Slobodan Milošević

Background
[
edit
]
Further information:
Anti-bureaucratic revolution
The history of the DPS begins with the political turmoil in Yugoslavia in the late 1980s. After
Slobodan Milošević
seized power in the
League of Communists of Serbia
, he went on to organize rallies that eventually ousted the leaderships of the
League of Communists of Yugoslavia
local branches in
Vojvodina
,
Kosovo
, and Montenegro. This series of events, collectively known as the
Anti-bureaucratic revolution
, swept into power new party leadership in Montenegro, one allied with Milošević, personified in
Momir Bulatović
,
Milo Đukanović
, and
Svetozar Marović
.
Official party logo stylized in Cyrillic script as was used during the 1990s
Under this new leadership, the League of Communists of Montenegro won by a landslide in the
1990 Montenegrin general election
, the first relatively free multi-party election in Socialist Montenegro, held in December 1990, taking 83 out of 125 seats in the
Parliament of Montenegro
. The party had a significant
head start
in the elections, as it had the entire established party structure at its disposal, while newly formed competition had to start from scratch. The party changed its name to the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (
Demokratska partija Crne Gore
) on 22 June 1991.
With Bulatović as the president, the DPS closely aligned Montenegro with Serbia and the policies of Slobodan Milošević. The party was firmly in power during the turbulent early 1990s, which saw the
breakup of Yugoslavia
and the beginning of the
Yugoslav Wars
. During these years, the party endorsed a union and close relations with Serbia, its sole partner in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY) from 1992. The party maintained the support of the electorate in this difficult period for Montenegro, winning both the
1992-1993
and
1996
parliamentary elections.
Split between Bulatović and Đukanović
[
edit
]
Milo Đukanović
Svetozar Marović
On July 11, 1997, the party's national committee
Glavni odbor
(GO) held a closed doors session after which the committee selected
Milica Pejanović-Đurišić
to replace Bulatović as the party president.
[44]
The party split had enormous implications, making a political confrontation between Đukanović and Bulatović inevitable. This manifested in the
1997 Montenegrin presidential election
held in October, which Đukanović won by a thin margin. Bulatović went on to form the
Socialist People's Party of Montenegro
(SNP) out of his defeated DPS faction, whose platform held a
unionist position on the question of Yugoslavia
and its short-lived successor state, Serbia and Montenegro. Meanwhile, Đukanović became a fierce opponent of Slobodan Milošević politics.
As a result of Đukanović's relationship with the United States, Montenegro received significant amounts of economic aid during this period, and negotiated limitations on
NATO bombings of its territory in 1999
, whereas the rest of Yugoslavia was subject to significantly heavier attacks. The DPS government gradually severed ties with Serbia by taking control over customs and the economy, introducing first the
German mark
, and subsequently the
euro
as legal tender, and generally reducing the influence of the federal government in Montenegro.
Montenegrin independence
[
edit
]
Following the
overthrow of Slobodan Milošević
on 5 October 2000, the DPS showed signs of greater support for Montenegrin independence. The campaign for the
2002 parliamentary elections
was devoted to the question of Montenegro's independence. The
European Union
mediated negotiations between the DPS and the newly elected
democratic government in Serbia
in 2003 imposed a three-year waiting period before an independence referendum could be held. The transitional period saw the transformation of the FR Yugoslavia to a loose union called
Serbia and Montenegro
. During the existence of the union state, the party congress added the goal of a "democratic, internationally-recognized, independent Montenegro" to its official platform.
[45]
The party then spearheaded the pro-independence campaign ahead of
Montenegro's referendum in 2006
. With 55.5% of voters opting for independence, Montenegro became an independent state on 3 June 2006.
Post-referendum era
[
edit
]
Former logo of the party used from the late 1990s until 2021
At the
2006 Montenegrin parliamentary election
as well as the subsequent
2009
and
2012
parliamentary elections, the DPS confirmed its position as the strongest political party in Montenegro. The party has formed the basis of all parliamentary majorities and has been the backbone of all government cabinets since independence, usually with its now traditional ally the
Social Democratic Party of Montenegro
and ethnic minority parties. Former party vice-president
Filip Vujanović
served as the
president of Montenegro
for three terms from 2002 until 2018, having won presidential elections in
2003
,
2008
, and
2013
, being succeeded by party leader
Milo Đukanović
in
2018
.
Đukanović remains the party president and its undisputed authority, serving either as
Prime Minister
or President of Montenegro from 1991 to 2006, 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2016. In 2006, the party leadership chose
Željko Šturanović
, former Minister of Justice, to succeed Đukanović as Prime Minister, until his resignation on 31 January 2008 for health reasons, whereupon Đukanović replaced him, only to resign again in December 2010 while retaining his role as DPS party leader.
[46]
After winning the
2012 parliamentary elections
, Đukanović once again assumed the position of Prime Minister. In 2015, the centre-left Social Democratic Party left the coalition with the DPS, accusing ruling party of corruption and abuse of power. At the
2020 parliamentary election
, DPS decided to run independently, with single candidate spot on the electoral list given to the nationalist
Liberal Party of Montenegro
.
[47]
Election eventually resulted in a victory for the opposition parties and the fall of the authoritarian DPS, after governing the country for 30 years, since the introduction of the multi-party system in 1990.

She is built of iron, and will be rigged as a fore-and-aft schooner, with two pole masts; and, having fine lines, she will have a very smart and pleasing appearance, besides being in other respects a most valuable additions to the Great Eastern Railway Company’s fleet. The comford and convenience of passengers have been studied in every way. The saloons and state rooms will be superbly fitted, and the ventilation, lavatories, &c., have been provided on a most ample scale. The accommodation for first-class passengers, 84 in number, is arranged under a long bridge amidships and forward of the engine and boiler space, and for the passengers the bridge deck will afford a spacious promenade. The second-class, 42 in number, will have their accommodation under the poop aft, with ample promenade space on the poop deck.

The upper deck is almost entirely covered by the long poop, bridge and top-gallant forecastle, only a small space or well deck being reserved between each of these for working cargo. The engines which are designed to drive the vessel at a speed of 14 knots, are of the condensing type. Each pair of engines has cylinders 30 inches and 57 inches diameter, by 36 inches stroke, and expected to indicate 1,600 horse-power collectively. Steam will be supplied by two double-ended boilers, 13 feet diameter by 18 feet 3 inches long, at a working pressure of 80lb per square inch.

View of the church.
The
Sanctuary of the Madonna del Baraccano
is a
Renaissance
style,
Roman Catholic
church, located at Piazza del Baraccano 2 at the southern edge of the formerly walled central
Bologna
, region of
Emilia-Romagna
, Italy. The church was built at the site of city wall, where a Madonna image was painted, hence called
Madonna of the Barricade
. Presently much at the site is undergoing restoration after the May 2012 earthquake.
History
[
edit
]
In 1401, during a siege of Bologna by
Gian Galeazzo Visconti
, an elderly woman was spied kneeling in prayer next to the wall where a Madonna image was present. Suspecting she was voicing secrets through a small gap in the wall, she was arrested, and the town leader,
Bente Bentivoglio
had a wall built interior to the wall to seal the site. When that wall collapsed soon after construction, Bentivoglio interpreted this as a miracle, had the old woman freed. In 1438 an oratory had been built. By 1497,
Giovanni Bentivoglio II
had Francesco Cossa repaint the image,
[1]
(original by
Lippo di Dalmasio
), and built a portico to shelter the image. In 1524, The church was built with its tympanum with a terracota virgin by
Alfonso Lombardi
. The porticoed forecourt was added in 1550, and the cupola was added in 1682 on a design by A. Barelli.
[2]
The interior has an altar to the right with a
Procession of St Gregory Magnus
by
Cesare Aretusi
and
Giovanni Battista Fiorini
. To the right of the main altar is the frescoed
Enthroned Madonna with Angels
(1472) by
Francesco del Cossa
. A silhouette of the praying woman can be seen. To the left of the altar is a
Holy Family
by
Lavinia Fontana
and a
San Carlo Borromeo
by
Lucio Massari
. In the next chapel is a
Disputa of St Catherine
(1551) by
Prospero Fontana
.
[3]
There are also works of
Federico Zuccari
and
Giovanni Marchesi
.
Adjacent to the church there was a convent and hospice for prostitutes.

where he did not attract any attention from scouts. His grades were too poor for a
four-year school
and, after finishing junior college at 19, took a job at a
department store
for $4.75 per hour (equivalent to $9.62 in 2022) while pitching for an amateur team in
Tijuana
. Three years later, in 1996, with a three-month-old daughter at home, he was convinced to attend a
Cincinnati Reds
tryout in
San Diego
. The Reds did not sign Cortés on the grounds that he was too short at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) but he was referred to an amateur team in San Diego, which he could afford to join only after being given $20 in gas money. Playing in San Diego, he impressed a Braves scout who was monitoring
Marcus Giles
; he received a signing bonus of $2,500 from the Braves.
[2]
On December 8, 2006, Cortés signed with the
San Francisco Giants
, but before pitching for the Giants, he was loaned to the Triple-A
Mexican League
where in
2008
he made the midseason All-Star team. Cortés signed with the
Lotte Giants
of the
Korea Baseball Organization
in August
2008
and served as their
closer
until the end of the season.

Research
[
edit
]
Fleming specializes in the human visual perception of materials and objects, and their physical properties.
[1]
He is particularly known for his contributions to establishing material perception as a field of study in vision science.
[14]
[16]
[17]
[18]
He uses a combination of research methods from experimental psychology, computational neuroscience, computer graphics and machine learning.
[4]
Material Perception
[
edit
]
Fleming’s early works focused on the
visual perception
of the
optical properties
of surfaces and materials, such as
gloss
,
[19]
translucency
[20]
and transparency.
[21]
He helped determine the role of visual cues such as motion
[22]
and binocular stereopsis
[23]
[24]
[25]
in the perception of surface reflectance, especially gloss. A recurring theme within this work was the concept that specular reflections behave unlike surface markings—such as pigmentation patterns or scratches—leading to specific visual cues for identifying specular reflections and therefore glossy surfaces. He also investigated how multi-component patterns of specular reflection lead to hazy glossy appearances.
[26]
His more recent studies on surface appearance have tested whether artificial neural networks can reproduce the patterns of errors and successes that human observers make when judging material properties.
[27]
[28]
[29]
In addition to studying how the visual system estimates optical properties of materials, he has also investigated the relationship between other material properties and material categories, and how these are affected by the viewing distance, as in the so-called ‘material-scale ambiguity’.
[30]
Fleming also led a number of studies on how the visual system infers the mechanical properties of materials, such as compliance,
[31]
elasticity,
[32]
and viscosity
[33]
[34]
[35]
[36]
from optical, shape and motion cues.
[37]
[38]
Most of these studies used finite elements computer simulations of liquids or deformable solids interacting with their surroundings. A recurring theme within this body of work is the idea that the visual system represents stimuli in a multi-dimensional space of midlevel visual features, which statistically characterize how shape, motion and appearance evolve over time. He and his colleagues have claimed that such representations facilitate disentangling intrinsic material properties from other factors that also contribute to the proximal stimulus
[18]
[35]
such as a flowing liquid’s speed, or the force deforming a compliant solid.
Early in his career, Fleming argued that the visual system infers material properties through heuristics, using simple image statistics that correlate with surface properties under typical viewing conditions.
[5]
[19]
[20]
Later however, he proposed that the visual system uses richer internal models of the appearance of objects and materials under typical viewing conditions—an idea he calls ‘Statistical Appearance Models'.
[16]
[39]
Specifically, he has suggested that the visual system acquires the ability to infer material properties (or other distal stimulus properties) by learning generative models of proximal stimuli through unsupervised learning objectives, such as compressing or predictive coding of image content.
[40]
[41]
A proof-of-concept of this theory was demonstrated by training an unsupervised artificial neural network model on a dataset of computer rendered images of bumpy, glossy surfaces.
[42]
Fleming and his colleagues found that the model spontaneously learned to disentangle scene variables—such as lighting and surface reflectance—even though it was given no explicit information about the true values of these variables. Moreover, the model correctly predicted both successes and failures (i.e., illusions) of human gloss perception.
Shape Perception
[
edit
]
Fleming’s early works focused on the visual estimation of three-dimensional (3D) shape from specular reflections,
[43]
[44]
shading
[45]
[46]
and texture.
[47]
He is particularly known as a proponent of the role of ‘orientation fields’ in shape perception.
[48]
[49]
Orientation fields refer to spatially varying patterns of the dominant local orientation across the image of a surface, as measured by populations of orientation-selective neurons at each image location.
[45]
[43]
[44]
[46]
[47]
Fleming and his colleagues have shown that local image orientation signals tend to vary smoothly across curved surfaces in ways that are systematically related to 3D shape properties.
[50]
For textured surfaces, local image orientation is related to first-order shape properties, especially surface slant and tilt.
[47]
For shading patterns and specular reflections, local image orientation structure is related to second-order shape properties, especially the direction of minimum second derivative of surface depths, and the ratio of minimum and maximum second derivative magnitudes.
[43]
[46]
He has argued that orientation fields provide a fundamental source of information about shape,
[51]
[52]
[53]
and that their use by the visual system predicts specific illusions of perceived shape, such as when illumination changes.
[54]
In addition to the visual estimation of 3D shape, Fleming has also investigated the perceptual organization of shape
[55]
[56]
and the use of shape to make additional inferences about objects and their properties,
[31]
[32]
[33]
[35]
[57]
—a process he calls ‘Shape Understanding’.
[10]
Fleming led a number of studies on how the visual system makes inferences about the processes and transformations that have formed objects or altered their shape.
[58]
[59]
[60]
[61]
[62]
[63]
[64]
A recurring theme within this body of work is that an object’s ‘causal history’ leaves traces in its shape, which can be used to identify which of its features are the result of shape-altering transformations.
[59]
[61]
Such transformations include simple spatial distortions
[58]
[59]
and more complex biological growth processes.
[60]
By analogy to the visual system’s ability to separate images depicting transparent surfaces into multiple distinct causes, Fleming and his colleagues refer to the separation of shape into distinct causes as ‘Shape Scission’.
[64]
An example of this is the ability to distinguish the causes of different shape features that occur when a face or object is fully covered with a cloth veil.
[65]
Some of the visible features of the surface of the cloth are caused by the textile draping of its own accord, while others are due to the protrusion of the underlying object. Observers can distinguish these causes, even when the hidden object is of unknown shape.
[65]
Fleming has also investigated the role of shape in object categorization, especially in one-shot learning of novel object categories from a single (or small number of) exemplars.
[66]
[67]
In this context, Fleming and colleagues developed a computational model for predicting the perceived similarity between pairs of two-dimensional (2D) shapes, called ‘ShapeComp’.
[68]
The model combines a large number of shape features to capture different aspects of shape. He and his colleagues have also studied how shape cues contribute to the visual perception of animacy,
[69]
and conversely how semantics alter the perceptual organization of shape.
[70]
Fleming and colleagues have argued that human visual one-shot categorization involves inferring a generative model from the exemplar object.
[66]
[67]
They have proposed that this involves segmenting the object into parts, and representing their relations in a way that can be modified to synthesize novel variants belonging to the same category as the exemplar. They claim that this idea is supported by experiments in which participants are presented with a single exemplar and are asked to draw novel variants.
[67]
Computer Graphics
[
edit
]
Fleming’s work in computer graphics has mainly focused on perceptually-based approaches to representing and modifying photographic imagery. He contributed to the development of
image-based
algorithms for altering the material appearance
[71]
and shape
[72]
of objects in photographs. His work on orientation fields led to methods for synthesizing images of objects with particular 3D shape and material appearance based on purely 2D image operations.
[73]
He also contributed to work investigating perceptually-based methods for converting between and presenting conventional (low-dynamic range) and
high-dynamic range
images.
[74]
[75]
He co-authored a text book entitled “Visual Perception from a Computer Graphics Perspective”
[76]
Grasping and interacting with objects and materials
[
edit
]
Fleming’s work on
motor control
has focused primarily on the effects of 3D shape
[77]
[78]
[79]
and material properties
[78]
[80]
[81]
—including
mass
,
[80]
[81]
friction
[80]
[82]
and
rigidity
[83]
—on
grasping
. He and his colleagues have investigated various illusions related to grasping,
[81]
[84]
including the ‘material-weight illusion,
[81]
a variant of the
size-weight illusion
, in which the expected weight of an object is manipulated through its surface material (instead of its volume as in the size-weight illusion). He and his colleagues developed a computational model for predicting human
precision grip
(thumb and forefinger) grasp locations on objects with varying 3D shape and materials properties.
[78]
The model combines multiple
cost functions
related to the properties of the object and the actor’s hand. The model predicted average human grasp locations approximately as well as different individuals’ grasps predict one another.
