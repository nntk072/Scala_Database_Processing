, of which there were two for each lens for reliability.
[205]
They used
exploding-bridgewire detonators
, a new invention developed at Los Alamos by a group led by
Luis Alvarez
.
[206]
To study the behavior of converging
shock waves
, Robert Serber devised the
RaLa Experiment
, which used the short-lived
radioisotope
lanthanum-140
, a potent source of
gamma radiation
. The gamma ray source was placed in the center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an
ionization chamber
. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests.
[207]
In his history of the Los Alamos project,
David Hawkins
wrote: "RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design".
[208]
Within the explosives was an aluminum pusher, which provided a smooth transition from the relatively low-density explosive to the next layer, the
tamper
of natural uranium. Its main job was to hold the critical mass together as long as possible, but it would also reflect neutrons back into the core and some of its uranium would fission. To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of neutron-absorbing boron.
[205]
A polonium-beryllium
modulated neutron initiator
, known as an "urchin",
[209]
was developed to start the chain reaction at precisely the right moment.
[210]
This work on the chemistry and metallurgy of radioactive polonium was directed by
Charles Allen Thomas
of the
Monsanto Company
and became known as the
Dayton Project
.
[211]
Testing required up to 500
curies
per month of polonium, which Monsanto was able to deliver.
[212]
The whole assembly was encased in a
duralumin
bomb casing to protect it from bullets and flak.
[205]
Remote handling of a kilocurie source of radiolanthanum for a
RaLa Experiment
at Los Alamos
The ultimate task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was suspected, but it was soon determined that there were multiple
allotropes of plutonium
.
[213]
The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300 °C to 450 °C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with
alpha particles
, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon using a
plutonium-gallium alloy
, which stabilized the δ phase and could be
hot pressed
into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.
[214]
The work proved dangerous. By the end of the war, half the chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element was detected in their urine.
[215]
A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site.
[216]
The hemispheres for the first plutonium
pit
(or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.
[217]
In contrast to the plutonium Fat Man, the uranium gun-type Little Boy weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. Overall responsibility for it was assigned to Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division, with the design, development, and technical work at Los Alamos consolidated under
Lieutenant Commander
Francis Birch
's group. The gun-type design now had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon was substituted.
[218]
[219]
Trinity
Main article:
Trinity (nuclear test)
Because of the complexity of an implosion-style weapon, it was decided that, despite the waste of fissile material, a full-scale
nuclear test
would be required. Oppenheimer codenamed in "Trinity".
[220]
In March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to
Kenneth Bainbridge
, who selected the
bombing range
near
Alamogordo Army Airfield
for the test site.
[221]
A base camp was constructed with barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive magazine and a commissary.
[222]
A pre-test explosion was conducted on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments. A wooden test platform was erected 800 yards (730 m) from Ground Zero and piled with 100 short tons (91 t) of TNT spiked with
nuclear fission products
.
[223]
[224]
The explosives of "the gadget" were raised to the top of the tower for the final assembly.
Groves did not relish the prospect of explaining to a Senate committee the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed "Jumbo" was constructed to recover the active material in the event of a failure. It was fabricated at great expense from 214 short tons (194 t) of iron and steel.
[225]
By the time it arrived, however, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower 800 yards (730 m) from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a
fizzled explosion
.
[226]
[223]
The
Trinity test
of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a
nuclear weapon
.
For the actual test, the weapon, nicknamed "the gadget", was hoisted to the top of a 100-foot (30 m) steel tower, as detonation at that height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber. Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target and generated less
nuclear fallout
. The gadget was assembled under the supervision of
Norris Bradbury
at the nearby
McDonald Ranch House
on 13 July, and precariously winched up the tower the following day.
[227]
At 05:30 on 16 July 1945 the gadget exploded with an
energy equivalent
of around 20 kilotons of TNT, leaving a crater of
Trinitite
(radioactive glass) in the desert 250 feet (76 m) wide. The shock wave was felt over 100 miles (160 km) away, and the
mushroom cloud
reached 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in height. It was heard as far away as
El Paso, Texas
, so Groves issued a cover story about an ammunition magazine explosion at Alamogordo Field involving gas shells.
[228]
[229]
Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the
Hindu
holy book, the
Bhagavad Gita
(XI,12):
कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो लोकान्समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः। ऋतेऽपि त्वां न भविष्यन्ति सर्वे येऽवस्थिताः प्रत्यनीकेषु योधाः॥११- ३२॥
If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one ...
[230]
[231]
together with verse (XI,32), which he translated, "Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds".
[232]
[233]
Personnel
At its peak in June 1944, the Manhattan Project employed about 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant operators and 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity declined, the workforce fell to 100,000 a year later, but the number of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult.
[234]
Due to high turnover, over 500,000 people worked on the project.
[235]
In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the
War Manpower Commission
. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.
[236]
The Kansas commission director stated that from April to July 1944 every qualified applicant in the state who visited a
United States Employment Service
office was urged to work at the Hanford Site. No other job was offered until the applicant definitively rejected the offer.
[237]
Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., speaks to service personnel Oak Ridge Tennessee in August 1945.
Tolman and Conant, in their role as the project's scientific advisers, drew up a list of candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work.
[238]
One source of skilled personnel was the Army itself, particularly the
Army Specialized Training Program
. In 1943, the MED created the
Special Engineer Detachment
(SED), with an authorized strength of 675. Technicians and skilled workers drafted into the Army were assigned to the SED. Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well.
[239]
On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.
[240]
An Associate Professor of
Radiology
at the
University of Rochester School of Medicine
,
Stafford L. Warren
, was commissioned as a colonel in the
United States Army Medical Corps
, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos.
[241]
The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials.
[242]
Yet in December 1945, the
National Safety Council
presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries—about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.
[243]
Secrecy
A billboard encouraging secrecy among Oak Ridge workers
Byron Price
, head of the
Office of Censorship
, called the Manhattan Project the best-kept secret of the war.
[244]
In 1945
Life
estimated that before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings "probably no more than a few dozen men in the entire country knew the full meaning of the Manhattan Project, and perhaps only a thousand others even were aware that work on atoms was involved." The magazine wrote that the more than 100,000 others employed with the project "worked like moles in the dark". Warned that disclosing the project's secrets was punishable by 10 years in prison or a fine of
US$10,000
(equivalent to $163,000 in 2022), they monitored "dials and switches while behind thick concrete walls mysterious reactions took place" without knowing the purpose of their jobs.
[245]
[246]
[247]
In December 1945 the US Army published a secret report assessing the security apparatus surrounding the Manhattan Project. The report states that the project was "more drastically guarded than any other highly secret war development." The surrounding security infrastructure was so vast and thorough that in the early days of the project in 1943, investigators vetted 400,000 potential employees and 600 companies for potential security risks.
[248]
Censorship
Security poster, warning office workers to close drawers and put documents in safes when not being used
Voluntary censorship of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After the start of the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the
National Academy of Sciences
to clear articles.
William L. Laurence
of
The New York Times
, who wrote an article on atomic fission in
The Saturday Evening Post
of 7 September 1940, later learned that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue.
[249]
The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist
Georgy Flyorov
wrote to
Josef Stalin
on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.
[250]
The Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project.
[251]
The Office of Censorship relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office. By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington, and the office began discussing with the project how to maintain secrecy. In June it asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing "atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons."
[252]
[244]
Soviet spies
Main article:
Atomic spies
The prospect of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected when there were equipment failures. While there were some problems believed to be the result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage.
[253]
However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese
fire balloon
struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down.
[254]
With so many people involved, security was difficult. A special
Counter Intelligence Corps
detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues.
[255]
By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel
Boris T. Pash
, the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the
Western Defense Command
, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley,
Haakon Chevalier
, about passing information to the Soviet Union.
[256]
The most successful Soviet spy was
Klaus Fuchs
, a member of the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos.
[257]
The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada.
[258]
Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of
Harry Gold
,
David Greenglass
, and
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
.
[259]
Other spies like
George Koval
and
Theodore Hall
remained unknown for decades.
[260]
The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the
Soviet atomic bomb project
was a shortage of uranium ore. Most scholars on the subject assert that the espionage saved the Soviets, at a minimum, one or two years in the development of their own atomic bomb.
[261]
Foreign intelligence
Main article:
Alsos Mission
In addition to developing the atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project was charged with gathering intelligence on the
German nuclear energy project
. It was believed that the
Japanese nuclear weapons program
was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, but it was initially feared that Germany was very close to developing its own weapons. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, a
bombing and sabotage campaign
was carried out against heavy water plants in German-occupied Norway.
[262]
A small mission was created, jointly staffed by the
Office of Naval Intelligence
, OSRD, the Manhattan Project, and Army Intelligence (G-2), to investigate enemy scientific developments. It was not restricted to those involving nuclear weapons.
[263]
The Chief of Army Intelligence, Major General
George V. Strong
, appointed
Boris Pash
to command the unit,
[264]
which was codenamed "Alsos" (Greek for "grove").
[265]
Allied soldiers dismantle the German experimental nuclear reactor at
Haigerloch
.
The Alsos Mission to Italy questioned physics laboratory staff at the
University of Rome
following the capture of the city in June 1944.
[266]
Meanwhile, Pash formed a combined British and American Alsos mission in London under the command of Captain Horace K. Calvert to participate in
Operation Overlord
.
[267]
Groves considered the risk that the Germans might attempt to disrupt the
Normandy landings
with radioactive poisons was sufficient to warn General
Dwight D. Eisenhower
and send an officer to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General
Walter Bedell Smith
.
[268]
Under the codename
Operation Peppermint
, special equipment was prepared and
Chemical Warfare Service
teams were trained in its use.
[269]
Following in the wake of the advancing Allied armies, Pash and Calvert interviewed
Frédéric Joliot-Curie
about the activities of German scientists. They spoke to officials at Union Minière du Haut Katanga about uranium shipments to Germany. They tracked down 68 tons of ore in Belgium and 30 tons in France. The interrogation of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in
Oranienburg
, so Groves
arranged for it to be bombed
on 15 March 1945.
[270]
An Alsos team went to
Stassfurt
in the
Soviet Occupation Zone
and retrieved 11 tons of ore from
WIFO
.
[271]
In April 1945, Pash, in command of a composite force known as T-Force, conducted
Operation Harborage
, a sweep behind enemy lines of
Hechingen
,
Bisingen
, and
Haigerloch
—the heart of the German nuclear effort. T-Force captured nuclear laboratories, documents, equipment and supplies, including heavy water and 1.5 tons of metallic uranium.
[272]
[273]
Alsos teams rounded up German scientists including
Kurt Diebner
,
Otto Hahn
,
Walther Gerlach
,
Werner Heisenberg
, and
Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker
. They were taken to England and interned at
Farm Hall
, a bugged house in
Godmanchester
. After the bombs were detonated in Japan, the Germans were forced to confront the fact that the Allies had done what they could not.
[274]
Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Preparations
Silverplate
B-29
Straight Flush
. The tail code of the
444th Bombardment Group
is painted on for security reasons.
The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the 17-foot (5.2 m) long Thin Man or the 59-inch (150 cm) wide Fat Man was the British
Avro Lancaster
, but using a British aircraft would have caused difficulties with maintenance. Groves hoped that the American
Boeing B-29 Superfortress
could be modified to carry a Thin Man by joining its two
bomb bays
together.
[275]
This became unnecessary after Thin Man was abandoned, as a Little Boy was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay,
[219]
but modifications were still required. The
Army Air Forces Materiel Command
at
Wright Field
, Ohio, began
Silverplate
, the codename for the modification of the B-29, in November 1943. Test drops were carried out at
Muroc Army Air Field
and the
Naval Ordnance Test Station
in California with Thin Man and Fat Man
pumpkin bombs
to test their ballistic, fuzing and stability characteristics.
[276]
The
509th Composite Group
was activated on 17 December 1944 at
Wendover Army Air Field
, Utah, under the command of Colonel
Paul W. Tibbets
. Its
393rd Bombardment Squadron
, equipped with Silverplate B-29s, practiced long-distance flights over water and dropped pumpkin bombs.
[277]
A special unit known as
Project Alberta
was formed at Los Alamos under Parsons's command to assist in preparing and delivering the bombs.
[277]
The 509th Composite Group deployed to
North Field
on
Tinian
in July 1945.
[278]
Most of the components for the Little Boy left San Francisco on the
cruiser
USS
Indianapolis
on 16 July and arrived on Tinian on 26 July. The remaining components, which included six highly enriched uranium rings, were delivered by three
Douglas C-54 Skymasters
of the 509th Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron.
[279]
Two Fat Man assemblies traveled to Tinian in specially modified 509th Composite Group B-29s, and the first
plutonium core
went in a special C-54.
[280]
At the end of December 1944, worried by the heavy losses occurring in the
Battle of the Bulge
, Roosevelt instructed Groves and Stimson that if the atomic bombs were ready before the war with Germany ended, they should be ready to drop them on Germany, but Japan was regarded as more likely.
[281]
In late April 1945, a targeting committee was established to determine which cities should be targets, and it recommended
Kokura
,
Hiroshima
,
Niigata
, and
Kyoto
. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would be making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto on the grounds of its historical and religious significance.
[282]
Nagasaki
was substituted.
[283]
In May 1945, the
Interim Committee
was created to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer; the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.
[284]
At the
Potsdam Conference
in Germany, Truman was informed that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, the leader of the
Soviet Union
, that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details. This was the first official communication to the Soviet Union about the bomb, but Stalin already knew about it from spies.
[285]
With the authorization to use the bomb against Japan already given, no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the
Potsdam Declaration
.
[286]
Bombings
On 6 August 1945, the
Enola Gay
, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, piloted by Tibbets, lifted off from North Field with a Little Boy in its bomb bay. Hiroshima, the headquarters of the
2nd General Army
and
Fifth Division
and a port of embarkation, was the primary target, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternatives. Parsons, the weaponeer in charge of the mission, completed the bomb assembly in the air to minimize the risks of a nuclear explosion in the event of a crash during takeoff.
[287]
The bomb detonated at an altitude of 1,750 feet (530 m) with a blast that was later estimated to be the equivalent of 13 kilotons of TNT.
[288]
An area of approximately 4.7 square miles (12 km
2
) was destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6-7% damaged. About 70,000 to 80,000 people, of whom 20,000 were Japanese combatants and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, or some 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed immediately, and another 70,000 injured.

On the morning of 9 August 1945, the
Bockscar
, a second B-29 piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major
Charles W. Sweeney
, lifted off with a Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the
Urakami
Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production and killed 23,200-28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.
[292]
Overall, an estimated 35,000-40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.
[293]
[294]
Groves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October.
[295]
Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave
Kirtland Field
for Tinian on 11 and 14 August.
[294]
At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast
another plutonium core
.
[296]
Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August.
[297]
It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority. Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.
[298]
On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren with orders to organize a survey team to report on the damage and radioactivity at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A party equipped with portable Geiger counters arrived in Hiroshima on 8 September headed by Farrell and Warren, with Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October.
[299]
This and other scientific missions to Japan provided valuable data.
[300]
The necessity of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki became a
subject of controversy among historians
. Some questioned whether an "atomic diplomacy" would not have attained the same goals and disputed whether the bombings or the
Soviet declaration of war
on Japan was decisive.
[295]
The
Franck Report
was the most notable effort pushing for a demonstration but was turned down by the Interim Committee's scientific panel.
[301]
The
Szilárd petition
, drafted in July 1945 and signed by dozens of scientists working on the Manhattan Project, was a late attempt at warning President Harry S. Truman about his responsibility in using such weapons.

In anticipation of the bombings, Groves had

prepare a history for public consumption.
Atomic Energy for Military Purposes
, known as the "Smyth Report", was released to the public on 12 August 1945.
[304]
Groves and Nichols presented
Army-Navy "E" Awards
to key contractors, whose involvement had hitherto been secret. Over 20
Presidential Medals for Merit
were awarded to key contractors and scientists, including Bush and Oppenheimer. Military personnel received the
Legion of Merit
, including the commander of the
Women's Army Corps
detachment, Captain Arlene G. Scheidenhelm.
[305]
At Hanford, plutonium production declined as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and swelling of the graphite moderator known as the
Wigner effect
. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. Production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would remain available. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a
redox
solvent extraction process as an alternative
plutonium extraction
technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.
[306]
Bomb engineering was carried out by the Z Division, named for its director,
Jerrold R. Zacharias
from Los Alamos.
[307]
Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to
Oxnard Field
, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of
Sandia Base
. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests.
[308]
By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia.
[309]
As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty hand-picked regular officers.
[310]
Nichols recommended that S-50 and the Alpha tracks at Y-12 be closed down. This was done in September.
[311]
Although performing better than ever,
[312]
the Alpha tracks could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2 million a month.
[313]
President
Harry S. Truman
signs the
Atomic Energy Act of 1946
, establishing the
United States Atomic Energy Commission
.
Nowhere was demobilization more of a problem than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much remained to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki needed work to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply. However, uncertainty about the future of the laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement; Bradbury remained in the post for the next 25 years.
[309]
Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.
[306]
Two Fat Man-type detonations were conducted at
Bikini Atoll
in July 1946 as part of
Operation Crossroads
to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships.
[314]
Able was detonated on 1 July 1946. The more spectacular Baker was detonated underwater on 25 July 1946.
[315]
After the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a number of Manhattan Project physicists founded the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
(1945) and
Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists
(1946), which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an educational program about atomic weapons.
[316]
In the face of the destructiveness of the bombs and in anticipation of the
nuclear arms race
several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on
international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons
. The
Baruch Plan
, unveiled in a speech to the newly formed
United Nations Atomic Energy Commission
(UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.
[317]
Following a domestic debate over the permanent management of the nuclear program, the
Atomic Energy Act of 1946
created the
United States Atomic Energy Commission
to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the
Armed Forces Special Weapons Project
(AFSWP).
[318]
Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District was not abolished until 15 August 1947.

The project expenditure through 1 October 1945 was $1.845 billion, equivalent to less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191 billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4 billion, over 90% of which was for building plants and producing fissionable materials, and less than 10% for weapon development.
[321]
[322]
A total of four weapons (the Trinity gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused Fat Man bomb) were produced by the end of 1945, making the average cost per bomb around $500 million in 1945 dollars. By comparison, the project's total cost by the end of 1945 was about 90% of the total spent on the production of US small arms (not including ammunition) and 34% of the total spent on US tanks during the same period.
[320]
Overall, it was the second most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, behind only the design and production of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress.
[323]
Legacy
See also:
Nuclear weapons in popular culture
The
Lake Ontario Ordnance Works
(LOOW) near
Niagara Falls
became a principal repository for Manhattan Project waste for the Eastern United States.
[324]
All of the radioactive materials stored at the LOOW site—including
thorium
,
uranium
, and the world's largest concentration of
radium
-226—were buried in an "Interim Waste Containment Structure" (in the foreground) in 1991.
[325]
[326]
[327]
The political and cultural impacts of the development of nuclear weapons were profound and far-reaching.
William Laurence
of
The New York Times
, the first to use the phrase "
Atomic Age
",
[328]
became the official correspondent for the Manhattan Project in spring 1945. In 1943 and 1944 he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Office of Censorship to permit writing about the explosive potential of uranium, and government officials felt that he had earned the right to report on the biggest secret of the war. Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test
[329]
and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the official press releases on them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and motivated its development in the United States and the Soviet Union.
[330]
The Manhattan Project left a legacy of a network of
national laboratories
: the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
,
Los Alamos National Laboratory
,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory
,
Argonne National Laboratory
, and
Ames Laboratory
. Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the
Brookhaven National Laboratory
at
Upton, New York
, and the
Sandia National Laboratories
at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72 million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946-1947.
[331]
They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that
Alvin Weinberg
, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call
Big Science
.
[332]
The Naval Research Laboratory had long been interested in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now
Chief of Naval Operations
, decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain
Hyman G. Rickover
, who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a
nuclear-powered navy
.
[333]
A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing
nuclear aircraft
.
[334]
Their
Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft
(NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately canceled.
[335]
The ability of the new reactors to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in
nuclear medicine
. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities, primarily
iodine-131
and
phosphorus-32
for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.
[336]
On handing over control to the Atomic Energy Commission, Groves bid farewell to the people who had worked on the Manhattan Project:
Five years ago, the idea of Atomic Power was only a dream. You have made that dream a reality. You have seized upon the most nebulous of ideas and translated them into actualities. You have built cities where none were known before. You have constructed industrial plants of a magnitude and to a precision heretofore deemed impossible. You built the weapon which ended the War and thereby saved countless American lives. With regard to peacetime applications, you have raised the curtain on vistas of a new world.
[337]
The
Manhattan Project National Historical Park
was established on 10 November 2015.

Civil trial attorney
Known for
Lead plaintiff’s counsel for various high-profile and highly publicized U.S. cases
Ervin A. Gonzalez
(June 6, 1960 - June 8, 2017) was an American
civil trial
attorney whose practice focused on
wrongful death
,
personal injury
,
medical negligence
,
product liability
and
class action
torts
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
He was a partner with the law firm Colson Hicks Eidson in the firm's
Coral Gables
office.
Gonzalez served as the lead plaintiff's counsel for various high-profile and highly publicized U.S. cases involving consumer class actions, product liability, medical negligence, construction product litigation, and trucking, aviation and maritime injury.
[2]
[3]
[4]
He was found dead at his home in Coral Gables on June 8, 2017.
[5]
Education
[
edit
]
Gonzalez graduated with
summa cum laude
honors from
St. Thomas University (Florida)
in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in political science. He earned his Juris Doctor degree from the
University of Miami School of Law
in 1985 with
cum laude
honors.
[2]
[6]
Legal career
[
edit
]
Gonzalez achieved a $60.9 million medical malpractice award that at the time ranked as one of the largest awards ever in a
Federal Tort Claims Act
case.
[7]
In 2005 Gonzalez secured a $65.1 million verdict in a wrongful death case against
Eller Media Company
for the electrocution death of a 12-year-old boy, who the jury found was killed by shoddy electrical work performed at one of its Miami bus shelters.
[8]
Gonzalez has also settled numerous cases for settlements greater than $1 million, including a $100 million settlement in 2006 with
Service Corporation International
, the largest funeral home operator in the U.S., for the desecration of graves in a Jewish cemetery.
[4]
In 2010 Federal Judge
Carl Barbier
of the Eastern District of Louisiana selected Gonzalez from a pool of 300 qualified applicants to sit on the Plaintiff Steering Committee (PSC) in the
multi-district litigation
surrounding the
BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico. Gonzalez was one of two Florida lawyers appointed to serve on the national PSC and oversee plaintiffs’ claims stemming from the spill.
[9]
[10]
Gonzalez was also selected by Federal Judge
Eldon E. Fallon
of Eastern District of Louisiana to serve on the 15-member PSC for the
Chinese drywall
litigation. He represented hundreds of homeowners who were victims of high-sulfur Chinese drywall in new home construction. He was the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the first jury trial in the country on the defective drywall, and the case resulted in a $2.5 million verdict for the plaintiffs. As a member of the PSC, Gonzalez assisted in securing a $1 billion settlement with Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin, a Chinese manufacturer of the drywall, and he helped to negotiate an $80 million class action settlement with insurance companies for many of the builders and installers of the drywall as well as a $55 million Florida class-action settlement with Banner Supply Company.
[3]
[11]
[4]
Gonzalez also represented U.S. Air Force veteran Robert Meltzer in 2011 in the first medical malpractice trial against a
VA
hospital for its improperly sanitizing medical equipment and infecting patients with bloodborne diseases. The court found that Meltzer contracted Hepatitis C at the Miami VA hospital, and he and his wife were awarded $1.25 million.
[4]
Board certifications and licenses
[
edit
]
Gonzalez was
board certified
in civil trial law and business litigation by
The Florida Bar
and the
National Board of Trial Advocacy
.
[3]
[6]
He was licensed to practice in Florida, New York, the District of Columbia, Texas and Colorado.
[2]
Industry and community involvement
[
edit
]
Gonzalez served as an adjunct professor of litigation and trial skills at the
University of Miami School of Law
from 1994 until the time of his death.
[2]
[4]
He served on the
St. Thomas University (Florida)
board of trustees, was a University of Miami Citizens board member, a past president of the Dade County Bar Association, and a past president of the Miami-Dade Trial Lawyers Association.
[2]
He served on the Board of Governors of
The Florida Bar
from 2000 to 2010, and as a member of the Board of Trustees of the
National Institute for Trial Advocacy
from 2004 to 2008.

The
Shuttleworth Foundation
was established in January 2001 by
South African
entrepreneur
Mark Shuttleworth
as an experiment with the purpose of providing funding for people engaged in social change.
[1]
While there have been various iterations of the foundation, its structure and how it invests in social innovation, the current model employs a fellowship model where fellows are given funding commensurate with their experience to match a year's salary, allowing them to spend that year developing a particular idea. The Foundation announced that it is shutting itself down "by the beginning of 2024."
[2]
Notable past and present fellows include
Marcin Jakubowski
(who develops the
Open Source Ecology
project),
Rufus Pollock
(co-founder of the
Open Knowledge Foundation
[3]
) and
Mark Surman
(now Executive Director of
Mozilla Foundation
.
[4]
)
Funding model
[
edit
]
The Foundation provides funding for people who have an unproven idea in the form of a 'salary', travel and office expenses. For every dollar invested by the Fellow in a project, the Foundation will put in ten or more, allowing the Fellow to own all Intellectual Property and processes once the active fellowship has ceased.

The
Sukhoi Superjet 100
(Russian:
Сухой Суперджет 100
,
tr.
Sukhoy Superdzhet 100
) or
SSJ100
is a
regional jet
designed by Russian aircraft company
Sukhoi
Civil Aircraft, a division of the
United Aircraft Corporation
(now: Regional Aircraft - Branch of the
Irkut Corporation
[5]
[6]
). With development starting in 2000, it made its
maiden flight
on 19 May 2008 and its first commercial flight on 21 April 2011 with
Armavia
.
The 46-49 t (45-48 long tons)
MTOW
plane typically seats 87 to 98 passengers and is powered by two 77-79 kN (17,000-18,000 lb
f
)
PowerJet SaM146
turbofans developed by a joint venture between French
Safran
and Russian
NPO Saturn
.  By May 2018, 127 were in service and by September the fleet had logged 300,000 revenue flights and 460,000 hours. By November 2021 the fleet had logged at least 2,000,000 hours.
[7]
The plane has recorded three
hull loss
accidents and 86 deaths as of November 2021
. In 2022, Sukhoi announced a Russified version of the body and electronics, without most of the Western components; the engine is also being replaced by a Aviadvigatel PD-8. Aeroflot has ordered 89 Irkut SSJ-Russified aircraft.
[8]
In August 2023, parent company Irkut rebranded itself as
Yakovlev
, with the Superjet to be known as the
SJ-100
.
[9]
Development
[
edit
]
Background
[
edit
]
JSC
Sukhoi was incorporated in May 2000 to develop the first all-new commercial aircraft in
post-Soviet
Russia.
[10]
Studies of the
Russian Regional Jet
(RRJ) began in 2001. After analysing the Russian market, Sukhoi identified a need for an aircraft with a range of between 3,000 and 4,500 km (1,900 and 2,800 mi), greater than typical regional jets. Three variants were initially envisaged: the RRJ60, RRJ75 and RRJ95, with 60, 78 and 98 seats respectively; a five-abreast layout was chosen as being optimal for this size range. Sukhoi estimated the targeted market to be around 800 aircraft, including 250-300 from Russia and the
Commonwealth of Independent States
.
[11]
On 15 October 2001, the
Russian government
allocated $46.6 million to the development of a new 70-80 seat regional jet, targeting first flight in 2006 and entry into service in 2007.
[12]
Sukhoi's RRJ was competing against
Myasishchev
's M-60-70 and
Tupolev
's
Tu-414
projects.
[13]
Boeing provided advice to Sukhoi and its partners on programme management, engineering, marketing, product development, certification, supplier management and customer support.
[14]
The Sukhoi RRJ was selected by
Rosaviakosmos
, the government's aviation and space agency, in March 2003.
[13]
The RRJ programme allocated $63.5 million to the development of a 4-5 tf (8,800-11,000 lbf) engine between 2003 and 2015. Four engines were initially envisaged: the
Pratt & Whitney PW800
, the
Rolls-Royce BR710
, the
General Electric CF34
-8, and the
Snecma
/
NPO Saturn
SaM146
.
[12]
[15]
The BR710 and the CF34-8 were eliminated by July 2002,
[16]
and the PW800 was subsequently rejected due to a perceived technical risk associated with its geared fan.
[17]
A formal memorandum of understanding was signed with Snecma on 29 April 2003, confirming the selection of the 14,000-17,000 lbf (62-76 kN) SaM146,
[18]
to be developed in a joint venture with NPO Saturn, based on the Snecma SPW14 and combining a Snecma DEM21 gas generator with an
Aviadvigatel
"cold section".
[12]
Key suppliers were selected in October 2003, including
Thales
for
avionics
,
Messier-Bugatti-Dowty
for
landing gear
,
Honeywell
for the
auxiliary power unit
,
Liebherr
for
flight controls
,
Intertechnique
for
fuel systems
,
Parker Hannifin
for
hydraulic systems
,
B/E Aerospace
for
interiors
.
[10]
At this time, Sukhoi anticipated a market for 600 aircraft by 2020 - representing 10% of global demand for regional jets - for a total sales volume of $11 billion.
Discussions were held with
Air France
and the
SkyTeam
alliance to ensure that the aircraft would meet western requirements.

certification was made in 2004 and was expected to be granted six months after the Russian approval.
[11]
The
Komsomolsk-on-Amur plant
was selected in February 2005 for final assembly, implementing
jig
-less assembly,
automatic
component alignment and automatic
riveting
.
The RRJ60 and RRJ75 were deemed to be less cost-effective,
[10]
and development was focused on the largest model, the 98-seat RRJ95. The 78-seater RRJ75 remained under consideration, and a future stretch was also envisaged.
[11]
The RRJ95 was renamed the
Sukhoi Superjet 100
at the
Farnborough Air Show
in July 2005.
The first order, for 30 aircraft, was signed on 7 December with
Aeroflot
.
[10]
In June 2007, Boeing expanded its assistance to cover flight and maintenance crew training and manuals, and spare parts management and supply.
[14]
On 22 August, Sukhoi and
Alenia Aeronautica
established the
SuperJet International
joint venture for customer support outside Russia and Asia.
[10]
Alenia Aeronautica
took a 25% stake in Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Corporation (SCAC) for $250 million, valuing it at $1 billion.
Development costs were expected to total $1 billion, with another $1 billion needed to develop the powerplant and for customer support.

Maiden flight
on 19 May 2008
The first SSJ was transported in an
Antonov 124
from
Komsomolsk-on-Amur
to
Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast
on 28 January 2007, for ground tests conducted by the
Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute
(TsAGI).
[19]
The SuperJet was officially unveiled on 26 September 2007 at
Dzyomgi Airport
in
Komsomolsk-on-Amur
.
[20]
By October 2007, initial deliveries were scheduled for 2009; plans called for the 95-98-seat model to be followed by a 75-78-seat shrink and a 110-seat stretch.
[21]
The
SaM146
engine was first run on 21 February 2008.
[22]
Tests were conducted by the
Gromov Flight Research Institute
, using an
Ilyushin Il-76
LL as a flying test bed.
[23]
The SuperJet 100 made its maiden flight on 19 May 2008, taking off from Komsomolsk-on-Amur.
[3]
By July, certification was expected for the third quarter of 2009, pushing back deliveries to later the same quarter.
[24]
On 24 December 2008, the second SSJ made its maiden flight.
[25]
By January 2009, the first two aircraft had completed over 80 flights, and the engines had accumulated 2,300 hours of tests.
[26]
In April 2009, the two prototypes were flown 3,000 km (1,600 nmi) from Novosibirsk to Moscow,
[27]
and
EASA
pilots conducted a number of familiarisation flights.
[28]
A third prototype joined the test campaign in July 2009.
[29]
The SSJ made its international debut at the 2009
Paris Air Show
; during the show,
Malév Hungarian Airlines
placed a $1 billion order for 30 aircraft.
[30]
As of June 2009, 13 aircraft were under construction, with the first four scheduled to be handed over to clients from December.
[31]
Armenian
Armavia
was to receive the first two, followed by
Aeroflot
, having ordered 30 with an option for 15 more. Other customers include Russian
Avialeasing
, Swiss AMA Asset Management Advisor, and Indonesian
Kartika Airlines
. Sukhoi expected production to reach a rate of 70 aircraft per year by 2012.
[30]
In December 2009, engine availability issues resulted in deliveries being delayed indefinitely.
[32]
On 4 February 2010, the fourth prototype made its maiden flight using engines removed from the first prototype, as a result of continuing delays in engine production, including NPO Saturn quality problems.
[33]
On 15 September 2010, static tests for certification of the aircraft were completed by TsAGI.
[34]
Certification
[
edit
]
Test flights over
Sanremo
,
Italy
By June 2010, certification was 90% complete but was delayed due to SaM146 engine problems that were not encountered during testing.
[35]
In September 2010, certification was expected for November.
[36]
In October 2010, noise was tested for certification authorities, Russian
IAC
and European
EASA
.
[37]
On 4 November 2010, the first production aircraft, intended for Armavia, was first flown.
[38]
By November 2010, the SSJ test fleet had made 948 flights totalling 2,245 hours.
[39]
On 3 February 2011, IAC granted a
Type Certificate
.
[40]
EASA's Type Certificate followed on 3 February 2012, allowing operations in European countries.
[41]
On 14 March 2022, EASA revoked the Superjet's airworthiness certificate as part of the
EU's sanctions against Russia
following the
Russian invasion of Ukraine
.
[42]
In-service developments
[
edit
]
In summer 2017, the
business jet
variant's additional fuel tanks were certified to carry 3,100 kg (6,800 lb) more fuel, increasing range from 4,420 km (2,390 nmi) to 6,000 km (3,200 nmi).
[43]
London City Airport
is a major destination for Irish airline
CityJet
, which was to receive 15 SSJ100s, but its steep 5.5°
approach
required new control laws,
wing flap
setting and modified brakes: test flights were to begin in December 2017, with certification planned for 2018, and the modified aircraft to be available in 2019.
[44]
In any event, CityJet ceased all use of SSJ-100 aircraft by November of 2020.
[45]
A new "sabrelet"
winglet
, helping
takeoff and landing
performance and delivering 3% better
fuel burn
, will be standard and available for
retrofit
.
[44]
Designed with
CFD
tools by Sukhoi and
TsAGI
, the "saberlets" debuted flight tests on 21 December 2017.
They should improve
hot and high
airport performance and cut costs up to $70,000 per year.
Parts of the wing are reinforced for the aerodynamic loads distribution change.
[46]
They should reduce fuel costs by 4%, flight-testing was completed after over 140 flights by October 2019.
[47]
The first aircraft with the composite winglets was delivered to Russian carrier
Severstal Aircompany
in December 2019.
[48]
By November 2018, the
TsAGI
carried out wind tunnel tests on two modified wing designs to save structural weight: one with less
wing sweep
and the other with more
relative thickness
, also enhancing aerodynamics and load capabilities, and improving
fuel efficiency
by nearly 10%.
[49]
Russified SSJ

Standard cabin seating
Cockpit
To resist the
Airbus-Boeing duopoly
pressure on
regional jets
through the
Embraer E-Jet E2
and the
Airbus A220
,
Sukhoi
would upgrade the SSJ100 to the SSJ100B and the "Russianised" SSJ100R.
[50]
Western content accounts for 55-60% of the original SSJ100's cost but
sanctions against Russia
are tightening.
[51]
As of December 2018, the US authorities did not send any feedback to Sukhoi over exports to Iran.
[52]
The SSJ100B would feature more powerful SaM146-1S18 engines, improved avionics software, enhanced
high-lift devices
controls and retrofittable "sabrelet" blended
wingtip devices
.
[50]
After 2021 the SSJ100R would replace western components by Russian ones for government customers and countries subject to Western
sanctions
[50]
such as
Iran Air Tours
and
Iran Aseman
.
[51]
SSJ100R could include a smaller variant of the
Aviadvigatel PD-14
engine (
Aviadvigatel PD-8
[51]
);
KRET
electronic units to replace the Thales
avionics
; a Russian
inertial navigation system
and
APU
to replace
Honeywell
's; and the
landing gear
to replace one produced by
Safran
.
[53]
Fuel burn
would be reduced by 5-8% with a new composite wing.
[51]
Russian content should double to 30% as
US restrictions
limit its export potential.
[54]
Sukhoi
forecasts
345 sales from 2018 to 2030, mostly in
post-Soviet states
and some in
south-east Asia
and
Latin America
, including an improved range
business jet
version.
[54]
The
seating capacity
is to be raised to 110, and hot and high operations to 4000 m and 50 °C. A
freighter
variant is also being studied.
[54]
Russian government
has earmarked
₽
3.2 billion ($51 million) toward the variant of the SSJ with indigenous propulsion and avionics, introduced at the
Eurasia Airshow
2018 in
Antalya
alongside the SSJ75.
[55]
In May 2021, Rostec announced the completion of the first experimental core 'hot section' of the
PD-8
engine.
[56]
The 'Russified' variant of the SSJ with the composite wing, indigenous avionics and the PD-8 engine later became known as the SSJ-New.
[57]
[

In July 2021,
UEC
exhibited the new engine at the 2021 Moscow Air Show and aimed to secure type certification by 2023.
[58]
In January 2022, a new control system, developed by UEC for the PD-8 engine, was being tested prior to integration with the engine.
[59]
The full domestic fabrications plan will take place in 2023 to 2024, replacing Western components.
[60]
[61]

Under a plan announced in June 2022 to bring the proportion of domestically produced aircraft to 80% of the Russian fleet by the end of the decade following the
international sanctions
brought in after the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine
, serial production of the SSJ-New was targeted for 2023.
[62]
In July 2022, a prototype SSJ-New fuselage was transported to test facilities near Moscow to undergo life cycle testing.
[63]
Further prototypes were assembled in 2023, with structural testing of the updated airframe and certification of the PD-8 engine both expected to be completed by the autumn. As of May 2023, serial production was expected to begin in 2024.
[64]
Yakolev SJ-100 went on a first test flight on August 30 2023.
[65]
Irkut Corporation integration
[
edit
]
At the end of November 2018,
United Aircraft Corporation
transferred
SCAC
from
Sukhoi
to the
Irkut Corporation
, to become UAC's
airliner
division, as
Leonardo S.p.A.
pulled out in early 2017 because of Superjet's poor financial performance. Irkut managed the
Superjet 100
, the
MC-21
and the Russo-Chinese
CR929
widebody, but the
Il-114
passenger turboprop and modernized
Ilyushin Il-96
-400 widebody stayed with
Ilyushin
. The new commercial division also included the
Yakovlev Design Bureau
, avionics specialist UAC—Integration Center and composite manufacturer AeroComposit.
[66]
The aircraft was to be known simply as the
Superjet 100
, dropping the Sukhoi name.
[67]
In July 2023, Irkut announced that the entire company would be rebranded under the Yakovlev name, to be effective by the end of August, though it did not specify whether the Superjet would undergo a further change of designation.
[68]
The name change was confirmed in August; the Superjet is to drop the Sukhoi name and be known as the SJ-100.
[9]
Potential Sukhoi divestment of SuperJet
[
edit
]
In March 2023, a deal was announced that would see UAC completely exit the Superjet 100 programme by selling its entire stake in
SuperJet International
(SJI) to an Emirati investment fund, Markab Capital Investments.
[69]
A new factory would be built at
Al Ain International Airport
, Abu Dhabi, where aircraft would be assembled before completion at SJI's Venice site. The deal would be conditional on SJI's assets being unfrozen by the European Union.
[70]
With a new supply chain to be established in Italy by Leonardo to service the Abu Dhabi production line, and the sale of intellectual property, it is unclear how Russian production of the SSJ-New, now solely limited to servicing Russia's domestic market, could continue under the deal.
[71]
Design
[
edit
]
A
SaM146
turbofan
The five-abreast cross-section is more optimised beyond 70 seats than the four-abreast
Bombardier CRJs
and
Embraer E-Jets
but smaller than the six-abreast
Airbus A320
and
Boeing 737
.
[11]
The SSJ100 typically seats 87 to 98 passengers.
[72]
In Russia, it replaces the aging
Tupolev Tu-134
and
Yakovlev Yak-42
aircraft.
[20]
It competes with the
Antonov An-148
,
Embraer E190
and the
Bombardier CRJ1000
. Sukhoi claims cash operational costs are lower than competitors by 8-10%, with reduced fuel burn per seat and longer maintenance intervals.
[73]
The design meets
CIS
AP-25, US FAR-25 and EU JAR-25 aviation rules, and conforms to ICAO Chapter 4 and FAR 36 Section 4 noise standards from 2006.
[74]
The
PowerJet SaM146
turbofans
provides 13,500 to 17,500 lbf (60 to 78 kN) of thrust for 70-120 seat aircraft.
[75]
The
Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade
supports it as a priority project.
[76]
In 2010, development costs were $1.4 billion excluding the SaM146 engine, with 25% funded from the federal budget,
[77]
rising to
US$
1.5 billion by 2013.
[78]
Unit cost was US$31-35 million in 2012,
[73]
rising to a US$50.1 million base price in 2018.
[79]
Over 30 foreign partnerships are involved. The
SaM146
engines are developed, manufactured and marketed by
PowerJet
, a joint-venture between the French
Snecma
and Russia's
NPO Saturn
. A joint venture between
Alenia
(later part of
Leonardo S.p.A.
) and
Sukhoi
,
SuperJet International
, was responsible for marketing in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Japan and Oceania, though Leonardo pulled out in early 2017 because of Superjet's poor financial performance and Sukhoi regained a 100% share in
SCAC
.
[66]
Assembly is performed at the
Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant
in the
Russian Far East
, while the
Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association
produces components; both are upgrading their facilities and were expecting to produce 70 airframes by 2012.
[80]
Operational history
[
edit
]
Introduction
[
edit
]
An SSJ100 of
Armavia
, its first operator
On 19 April 2011, the first production aircraft was handed over to
Armavia
at
Zvartnots Airport
in
Yerevan
, to be operated to
Moscow
and
Sochi
, as well as Ukrainian cities.
[81]
The aircraft was named after
Yuri Gagarin
.
[82]
On 21 April, the first commercial flight landed at
Moscow Sheremetyevo
, lasting 2 h 55 min; Armavia used the
Airbus A319
on this route before switching to the Superjet 100.
[83]
On 1 May, it made its first commercial flight to
Venice Airport
in around 4 hours, it had accumulated 50 hours in 24 flights by then.
[84]
By March 2012, the six aircraft operated by
Aeroflot
were flying 3.9 hours/day instead of the standard 8-9 hours due to failures and parts delivery delays, and the airline asked for compensation.
[85]
In August 2012, Armavia announced that it had returned both of its SSJ100s to the manufacturer.
[86]
[87]
Armavia then avoided further deliveries.
[88]
In February 2013, Sukhoi stated teething problems are usual in new airliners.
[89]
The SSJ entered service with Mexican
Interjet
on 18 September 2013; in their first four weeks, the first two aircraft operated were flown 580 times over 600 hours with a daily utilisation of 9.74 hours and a dispatch reliability of 99.03%.
[90]
By June 2014, Interjet had received seven SSJ100s and the dispatch reliability had increased to 99.7%.
[91]
On 12 September 2014, Interjet started regular passenger flights to the US, on the
Monterrey, Mexico
, -
San Antonio, Texas
, route.
[92]
However, Interjet confirmed by January of 2020 that it was planning to phase out its SSJ100 fleet; by November of that year was operating only 4 of its 22 SSJ100 models;
[93]
quit flying altogether in December 2020; and, entered bankruptcy in April 2021.
[94]
[95]
On 3 June 2016, the Irish carrier
CityJet
was the first western European airline to take delivery of an SSJ100.
[96]
But CityJet had ceased all use of SSJ-100 aircraft by November of 2020.
[45]
Dependability
[
edit
]
An SSJ100 of
Interjet
, the first
North American
customer
On 24 December 2016, the Russian
Federal Air Transport Agency
grounded seven jets after a
tail
component of an
IrAero
SSJ100 showed
metal fatigue
, leading Sukhoi to inspect the entire fleet.
[97]
By 27 December, all aircraft had been inspected and it had been shown that the defect was not
systemic
as it featured multiple
redundancies
and a
safety margin
doubling the normal loads.
[98]
Interjet grounded half of its fleet of SSJ100s during this period, but all of its aircraft were returned to service by the first week of January 2017 after Sukhoi sent 22 technicians to repair the grounded aircraft.
[99]
In June 2017, dispatch reliability increased to 97.85% from 96.94% a year earlier, while there were 89.6 malfunctions per 1,000 flight-hours, down by 40%.
[100]
On 21 July 2017, following the discovery of
horizontal stabiliser
rear spar
cracks
, the
EASA
mandated compulsory inspections.
[101]
Sukhoi recognises it needs to improve
customer support
with more responsiveness and availability for
flight training
, engineering and
spare parts
supply.
[44]
In early November 2017, the Russian
Federal Air Transport Agency
and
Italian Civil Aviation Authority
(ENAC) amended their bilateral
airworthiness
agreement, hitting SSJ export sales.
[43]
Interjet claimed its capital cost for 10 Superjets was equivalent to the
pre-delivery
payment for one
Airbus A320
.
[102]
The pre-delivery payment amounts to 15-30% of an aircraft list price.
[103]
An A320 list price was $88.3M in 2012.
[104]
In January 2018,
Bloomberg
reported that four of
Interjet
's 22 SSJ100s were being
cannibalised
for parts to keep others running after having been grounded for at least five months because of
SaM146
maintenance delays.
[105]
This was later refuted by Interjet.
[106]
One grounded SSJ100 was due to be back in service on 19 January 2018 and the remaining three in March.
[107]
In August 2018, Russian regional carrier
Yakutia Airlines
considered withdrawing their SSJs, after two were grounded because their engines were removed after 1,500-3,000 cycles, below the 7,000 specified, and no replacements were available.
PowerJet
was expanding its repair capacity and lease pool as engine maturity improved, noting that the SaM146 engine achieved 99.9%
dependability
since its 2011 introduction.
[108]
Productivity
[
edit
]
In September 2018, Interjet was reported to be considering replacing its SSJ100s with
Airbus A320neos
, to make better use of its slots, with the SSJ technical problems possibly also a factor.
[109]
On 12 September, Interjet denied the report.
[110]
It was later reported that Interjet intends to phase out some of its Superjets and take 20 more A320neos, maybe alongside newer Superjet deliveries; it will have access to an enhanced SSJ spares inventory in
Mexico City
and is installing a
flight simulator
in
Toluca
.
[111]
The updated SSJs would have
winglets
, a higher
MTOW
and improved systems and interior.
[112]
Sukhoi has also proposed to increase the cabin density from 93 to 108 seats by reducing the
pitch
from 34 to 30 in (86 to 76 cm).
[113]
While the airline was attracted by its low introductory price, Sukhoi was forced to reimburse Interjet in 2018 after its fleet of 30 suffered persistent faults.
[114]
An SSJ100 of
CityJet
, the first western European operator
In October 2018, Sukhoi and engine contractor
UEC
agreed on a plan, backed by the
Russian government
, to focus on customer support rather than deliveries in order to improve dispatch reliability.
[115]
At the end of November 2018,
United Aircraft Corporation
transferred
SCAC
from Sukhoi Holding to the
Irkut Corporation
, to become UAC's airliner division.
[66]
By then,
Brussels Airlines
was seeking alternatives for its four SSJ100s wet-leased from
CityJet
, as teething problems affected their reliability.
[116]
By February 2019, CityJet's remaining five SSJ100s stood idle and were expected to be transferred to Slovenia's
Adria Airways
, which committed for 15 in late 2018,
[117]
though Adria subsequently cancelled its order in April 2019.
[118]
Neither CityJet nor Brussels Airlines have commented as to why they dropped the SSJ, though low reliability, difficult maintenance and spare parts availability are suspected to have contributed.
[119]
By the end of the first quarter of 2019, 15 of Interjet's 22 SSJs were out of service. Further talks with Sukhoi were deadlocked, with Interjet reportedly unwilling to pay for repairs to the PowerJet SaM146 engines.
[120]
Interjet's reliability issues are compounded by the lack of service facilities in the Americas for the SSJ, a factor which also contributed to the poor reliability recorded by CityJet,
[121]
On 15 May 2019, Interjet announced that it is to sell its 20 SSJs, of which only five are operational, as it is no longer profitable to operate aircraft of this size in Mexico.
[122]
Therefore, As of May 2019
, Sukhoi has had trouble selling the Superjet and renewing leasing contracts outside of Russia because of reliability and service network issues, resulting in an average of 109 flight hours per month for Russian airlines, approximately half the
Embraer EMB 170
productivity, and just a third of a Boeing or Airbus jet.
[114]
[
verification needed
]
Unease with the SSJ's low reliability also spread to Russian operators.
[123]
Slow sales
[
edit
]
Sukhoi delivered only three SSJs in the first half of 2019; its financial results show a sevenfold drop in aircraft sales revenue and a fourfold drop in overall sales revenue, resulting in a 32% increase in its net loss. The company needs to achieve a production rate of 32 to 34 aircraft per year to make a profit, though demand for Russian models in the 60-120 seat category is forecast to be only 10 aircraft per year over a 20-year period. In the short-term, the company's main hope is that Aeroflot will firm up its 2018 preliminary agreement for 100 SSJs.
[124]
Yamal Airlines
, the second-largest Russian SSJ operator, announced the cancellation of its order for 10 further SSJs, citing high servicing costs.
[125]
Of 30-40 SSJs owned by Aeroflot, only 10 are reportedly usable at a time due to maintenance problems.
[126]
Aeroflot cancelled approximately 50 Superjet flights in the week following the
Flight 1492
accident.
Kommersant
cited industry sources as saying the Superjet 100 had lower dispatch reliability than Airbus and Boeing aircraft in the airline's fleet historically and attributed a rise in cancellations to "increased safety measures" at Aeroflot while the accident is investigated.
[127]
On 4 June, the Russian
Federal Air Transport Agency
(Rosaviatsiya) ordered carriers to perform one-time inspections of the SSJ, including a general check of the aircraft's condition and verification of aircraft and engine logs, by 25 June.
[128]
A total of 12 jets were delivered in 2020 to the following operators:
Rossiya Airlines
, Azimuth Airlines,
Red Wings Airlines
.
[129]
The sole remaining western operator, Interjet, down by the end of November 2020 to just four operational SSJ100s,
[130]
quit flying in December 2020 and entered bankruptcy in April 2021.
[131]
[132]
Part of Interjet’s plan was to try to return its 22 SSJ-100s to Sukhoi to cancel its debt, and resume flying with 10 Airbus A320 aircraft.
[133]
In December 2020,
Rossiya Airlines
announced that it intends to operate 66 Superjets by the end of 2021, transferred from its parent company Aeroflot which currently has 54 SSJs.
[134]
Impact of sanctions against Russia
[
edit
]
Russian operators of the Superjet 100 encountered difficulties in keeping their fleets airborne as result of
sanctions imposed
following the
Russian invasion of Ukraine
. In 2023, it emerged that there was a shortage of parts for the
SaM146
engines, namely igniter plugs produced in the United States and French fuel filters for which no domestic replacement could be found.
[135]
Rossiya Airlines
expressed fears that only 40% of its Superjet 100 fleet would be active in the spring and summer of 2023 due to lack of parts.
[136]
In September 2022, UEC Saturn, producer of the SaM146, resorted to cleaning old filters as a method to extend the lifetime of the engines, though this procedure was banned by the Russian regulator due to lack of formal certification.
[135]
Variants
[
edit
]
Three variants were initially planned, seating 60, 78 and 98 passengers: the RRJ-60, RRJ-75 and RRJ-95, respectively. By 2007, the RRJ-60 had been dropped, to focus on the 98-seater, with the 78-seater to follow.
[137]
The basic version was certified by the
EASA
on 3 February 2012, the RRJ-95LR100 with an
MTOW
increased from 45.88 to 49.45 t (101,100 to 109,000 lb) and the RRJ-95B100 with thrust increased from the SaM146-1S17 of 76.84 to 79 kN (17,270 to 17,760 lbf) -1S18s were added on 7 March 2017.
[138]
The RRJ-95LR100 range is increased to 4,578 km (2,472 nmi).
[139]
The RRJ-95B100 takeoff distance is reduced by 10%.
[140]
130-140 seat stretch
[
edit
]
In 2011, the
Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade
mentioned the
stretched
Superjet 130NG, seating 130.
[141]
It would have an
aluminium
fuselage and
composite
wings.
[142]
The new materials were intended to reduce weight by 15-20%, increase service life by 20-30% and reduce operating costs by 10-12%.
[141]
In 2013, funding was planned to start in 2016 for production from 2019 to 2020. It would have used a derivative of the
Irkut MC-21
composite wing and
Pratt & Whitney PW1000G
engines. The 130-seat stretch would have been known as the Sukhoi Superjet 130NG.
[143]
It would have competed with the
Airbus A220
and
Embraer E-Jet E2 family
.
[144]
115-120 seat stretch
[
edit
]
In 2016, a shorter stretch seating up to 120, using larger wings but the same engines and tail, was planned for introduction in 2020.
[145]
In 2017, with a business plan for 150 aircraft, a go-ahead for the NG 130-seat stretch depended on the availability of engines with sufficient
thrust
and was due by the end of the year.
[146]
The aircraft could carry up to 120 passengers with the existing engines, and up to 125 passengers with
airframe
continuous improvements;
PowerJet
could certify a thrust increase of 2% within three years.
[147]
Sukhoi was to decide by the first quarter of 2018 whether to launch first a shortened 75-seat or a stretched variant needing higher thrust SaM146s or an alternative engine.
[44]
75 seat shrink
[
edit
]
At the February 2018
Singapore Air Show
, Sukhoi announced a possible 75-seat shrink, to enter service in 2022.
With a smaller, optimised aluminium or composite wing, it would be powered by 17,000 lbf (76 kN)
Pratt & Whitney PW1200Gs
, detuned
SaM146s
or
Aviadvigatel PD-14
derived PD-7s.
[148]
The 3-3.5 m (9.8-11.5 ft) shorter fuselage would be 3 t (6,600 lb) lighter and it would fall within US
scope clauses
, but would require Western service and support experience.
[149]
Demand for such jets is 200-300 in Russia and up to 3,000 overseas; introduction could slip to early 2023.
As Sukhoi and
Irkut
may be consolidated into
United Aircraft
, some structures and avionics could be closer to the
Irkut MC-21
for
commonality
.
[150]
A unified platform with identical controls would ease pilot conversions;
S7 Airlines
committed to 75 aircraft.
In July 2018, a composite wing was preferred and a 3-metre test section will be manufactured and tested. The variant would retain the SaM146 and
empty weight
should be reduced by 12-15%.
[151]
In 2018, serial production was planned for 2025, four years after design approval. By 2019, the priority had shifted to the replacement of Western parts on the SSJ100 so that the aircraft can be sold to US-sanctioned countries such as Iran. S7 Airlines, which had committed to 75 of the shortened aircraft, may seek alternatives from Bombardier or Embraer.
[152]
In September 2019, the owner of S7, Vladislav Filev, confirmed his understanding that the SSJ75 project had been abandoned. He explained that S7 had insisted on the participation of its own experts in the test programme, and had demanded the replacement of the composite floor that showed insufficient fire resistance in the Sheremetyevo crash, together with a redesign of the wheel wells.
[153]

Location of
Mount Salak crash
in Indonesia
There have been three
hull loss
accidents and 86 deaths as of June 2019.
On 9 May 2012, a demonstration flight
directly struck Mount Salak
in
Indonesia
, killing all 45 on board (Sukhoi personnel and representatives of various local airlines). The
TAWS
was ignored by the pilot, distracted by a conversation with a potential customer.
[159]
On 21 July 2013, during
autoland
evaluation of an RRJ-95B (Russian experimental registry) with a single engine in a
crosswind
at
Keflavík Airport
in
Iceland
, the fuselage hit and slid down the runway with the gear up. During an intended
go-around
, the fatigued pilot throttled down the wrong engine, causing the aircraft to lose thrust sufficient for controlled flight. The plane continued to lose altitude and hit the runway even as the pilot realized his mistake and throttled up the engine. One of the five crew was injured during evacuation. The
Icelandic Aircraft Accident Investigation Board
investigated the event and issued nine recommendations.
[160]
[161]
[162]
On 10 October 2018, a
Yakutia Airlines
SSJ100 slid off the runway at
Yakutsk Airport
as the main
landing gear
collapsed. All 87 passengers and five crew were safely evacuated and none were seriously injured.
[163]
The excursion may have been caused by ice on the runway or the airstrip's poor state of repair.
[164]
The airliner was damaged beyond repair and was expected to be written off.
[165]
On 5 May 2019, as
Aeroflot Flight 1492
was climbing after takeoff from
Moscow Sheremetyevo
, at 6,900 ft (2,100 m)
lightning
discharged close to the aircraft from a nearby
cumulonimbus cloud
with a 6,000 ft (1,800 m) base. The
radio
and other equipment failed, and the flight crew chose to make an
emergency landing
at Sheremetyevo. The aircraft
bounced
several times after an initial touchdown, and after the fourth hard touchdown a
fire
erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. An
emergency evacuation
was then carried out but 41 out of 78 occupants died.

Range of the Soringa whiting
The
soringa whiting
(
Sillago soringa
), also known simply as
soringa
or
soringa sillago
, is a poorly known
species
of
coastal
marine
fish
of the smelt-whiting family,
Sillaginidae
. The Soringa whiting is known exclusively from the east coast of
India
, inhabiting shallow
inshore
environments, particularly
sandy
substrates
.
S. soringa
was first described in 1982 by Dutt and Sujatha, with the
taxonomic
status of the species was questioned by Roland McKay in his review of the Sillaginidae, with similar features to
S. asiatica
suggesting it is a
senior synonym
of the latter.
Taxonomy and naming
[
edit
]
The Soringa whiting is one of over 30 species in the genus
Sillago
,
[1]
which is one of five genera belonging to the smelt whiting family
Sillaginidae
, this family was previously considered to be part of the
Percoidea
, a
suborder
of the
Perciformes
. The 5th edition of
Fishes of the World
classifies the Sillaginidae in the order
Spariformes
.
[2]
The species was first
scientifically described
by
S. Dutt
and
J. Sujatha
in 1982 based on a specimen taken from the western
Bay of Bengal
(near the Indian city of
Visakhapatnam
), which was later designated to be the
holotype
. The specimen was accidentally caught whilst carrying out a taxonomic study on
ladyfish
in the region, with a
minitrawler
being used to sample the area.
[3]
Whilst reviewing the Sillaginidae,
Roland McKay
was unable to examine the holotype, but concedes
S. soringa
is very similar to
S. asiatica
morphologically, and is probably
synonymous
.
[4]
McKay described
S. asiatica
in 1983, while
S. soringa
was described in 1982, thus giving it preference and rendering
S. asiatica
a
junior synonym
. Without the holotype, however, McKay retained both species pending further detailed studies on the species.
[4]
The species is commonly referred to as 'soringa whiting', 'soringa sillago' or simply 'soringa', the name given to the fish on the Indian coast, and from which the specific name of the fish is derived.
[3]
Description
[
edit
]
The smelt-whitings are all very similar in their body morphology and external
anatomy
, with the Soringa whiting no exception. The species has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal
mouth
, with a concave-up dorsal profile and a straight ventral profile. The maximum reported size for the Soringa whiting is 15 cm.
[5]
The
fin
anatomy is highly useful for identification purposes, with the species having 11
spines
in the first
dorsal fin
, with one spine and 21
soft rays
on the second dorsal fin. The
anal fin
has two spines with 22 soft rays
posterior
to the spines. The
pectoral fins
have 15-16 soft rays while the
ventral fin
consists of a single spine and 5 soft rays.
[3]
Lateral line
scales
and cheek scales are also distinctive, with Soringa whiting possessing 64 to 68 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 2 rows, the upper
cycloid
and the lower
ctenoid
. The rest of the body is covered in ctenoid scales.
[4]
The amount of
vertebrae
is also diagnostic, having 34 in total. The
swimbladder
is the major distinguishing feature, being lancolate with a single median finger like extensions and a pair of recurved anterior extensions each side. There is a single post coelomic extension, and a central blind tubular duct arising in on the ventral side of the swimbladder.
[4]
The Soringa whiting is a
gray
brown
on the dorsal and upper flanks, becoming paler laterally, while the lower flanks and ventral surface are a milky
white
.
[5]
Small discrete black spots populate the anterior dorsal fin membrane, becoming more numerous toward the anterior half of the fin. The soft dorsal fin has a continuous grey band, running parallel to and close to the anterior edge of each ray. The membrane of the anal fin has similar black dots to the dorsal, but to a lesser extent. The pectoral fin and ventral fins are
golden
to
hyaline
while the caudal fin is hyaline with black dots.
[3]
Distribution and habitat
[
edit
]
The Soringa whiting is currently only known from the east coast of
India
and thus only from a small area of the
Indian Ocean
.
[6]
Is likely the range of the species may be greater than this however, due to confusion with
S. asiatica
and
S. sihama
, resulting in the small reported range.
Soringa whiting, like most sillaginids is an
inshore
species and is known to inhabit
sandy
substrates
at 5 to 30 m depth.
[5]
Researchers studying digenean parasites on sillaginids have noted
S. soringa
,
S. lutea
and
S. indica
show seasonal migrations where the juveniles occur in shallow
coastal
waters during winter months and move
offshore
during summer.
[7]
Nothing else is known of the species biology or
ecology
. Due to confusion with other species, its contribution to local
fisheries
is unknown, possibly being locally important.

Antonio Bueno
(21 July 1918 - 26 September 1984) was an Italian
painter
of
Spanish
origin, who acquired Italian citizenship in 1970. He was born in
Berlin
while his journalist father was posted there by the newspaper
ABC
of
Madrid
.
Life and career
[
edit
]
Bueno undertook art studies in
Spain
and
Switzerland
. In 1937, he was in
Paris
, where he exhibited at the
Salon des Jeunes
; then in 1940 with his brother Xavier, he moved to
Italy
. After a
post-impressionist
experience, immediately after
World War II
he joined the school of Armenian artist
Gregorio Sciltian
, painting
trompe-l'œil
work. With
Pietro Annigoni
and his own brother, Bueno took part in the "Pittori moderni della Realtà (Modern Painters of Reality)" group .
[1]
A dynamic and restless experimenter, after these experiences he conducted in-depth research in
genres
:
abstract
painter in 1950-53 while working as secretary for the
Numero
magazine;
neometaphysic
painter with his
clay pipe
series in 1953-57;
verist
;
materiologic
as a follower of
Informale
with a number of imprint forms in 1960-62;
signaletic
and
pop
in the middle of the 1960s;
neodada
and visual painter - all this as an eternal combinative play of subjects and materials.
[2]
Bueno's final affirmation occurred at the
Biennale di Venezia
of 1984, a few months before his death, when he was already gravely ill: he exhibited a series of magistral work that was highly acclaimed and undoubtedly represents the apex of his whole production.

Michael Joseph Jackson
(August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Known as the "
King of Pop
", he is regarded as
one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century
. During his four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated street dance moves such as the
moonwalk
, which he named, as well as the
robot
.
The eighth child of the
Jackson family
, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers
Jackie
,
Tito
,
Jermaine
, and
Marlon
as a member of
the Jackson 5
(later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at
Motown Records
. He became a solo star with his 1979 album
Off the Wall
.
His music videos
, including those for "
Beat It
", "
Billie Jean
", and "
Thriller
" from his 1982 album
Thriller
, are credited with breaking
racial barriers
and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of
MTV
and continued to innovate with the videos for his subsequent albums:
Bad
(1987),
Dangerous
(1991),
HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I
(1995), and
Invincible
(2001).
Thriller
became the
best-selling album of all time
, while
Bad
was the first album to produce five US
Billboard
Hot 100
number-one singles.
[nb 1]
From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to
his changing appearance
,
relationships
, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he
was accused of sexually abusing
the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he
was tried and acquitted
of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI
found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson
in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts,
This Is It
, Jackson
died
from an overdose of
propofol
administered by his personal physician,
Conrad Murray
, who was
convicted in 2011
of
involuntary manslaughter
for his involvement in Jackson's death. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music.
Jackson's televised memorial service
, held at the
Staples Center
in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people.
Jackson is one of the
best-selling music artists
of all time, with estimated sales of over 400
million records worldwide.
[nb 2]
He had 13
Billboard
Hot 100 number-one singles
(
fourth highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era
) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single on the
Billboard
Hot 100 in five different decades. His honors include 15
Grammy Awards
, six
Brit Awards
, a
Golden Globe Award
, and 39
Guinness World Records
, including the "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
(twice), the
Vocal Group Hall of Fame
, the
Songwriters Hall of Fame
, the
Dance Hall of Fame
(making him the only recording artist to be inducted) and the
Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame
.
Life and career
Early life and the Jackson 5 (1958-1975)
Jackson's childhood home in
Gary
,
Indiana
, pictured in March 2010
Michael Joseph Jackson
[9]
[10]
was born in
Gary
,
Indiana
, on August 29, 1958.
[11]
[12]
He was the eighth of ten children in the
Jackson family
, a working-class
African-American
family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.
[13]
[14]
His mother,
Katherine Esther Jackson
(
née
Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a
country-and-western
performer, and worked part-time at
Sears
.
[15]
She was a
Jehovah's Witness
.
[16]
His father,
Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson
, a former boxer, was a crane operator at
US Steel
and played guitar with a local
rhythm and blues
band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.
[17]
[18]
Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army
scout
; family lore held that he was also a Native American
medicine man
.
[19]
Michael grew up with three sisters (
Rebbie
,
La Toya
, and
Janet
) and five brothers (
Jackie
,
Tito
,
Jermaine
,
Marlon
, and
Randy
).
[17]
A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.
[20]
In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers — a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito and Jermaine — as backup musicians playing
congas
and
tambourine
.
[21]
[22]
Michael said his father told him he had a "fat nose",
[23]
and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes.
[16]
[24]
Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael.
[25]
Katherine said that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up.
[26]
[27]
Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which had a deeper impact on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble.
[28]
Michael said that during his youth he was lonely and isolated.
[29]
Later in 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to
the Jackson 5
.
[30]
In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to
Robert Parker
's 1965 song "
Barefootin'
" and sang
the Temptations
' "
My Girl
".
[31]
From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the
Midwest
; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the
Chitlin' Circuit
as the opening act for artists such as
Sam & Dave
,
the O'Jays
,
Gladys Knight
and
Etta James
. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where
striptease
shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.
[32]
[33]
In August 1967, while touring the
East Coast
, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the
Apollo Theater
in
Harlem
.
[34]
Michael Jackson (center) as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1972. The group were among the first
African American
performers to attain a crossover following.
[35]
The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label,
Steeltown Records
; their first single, "
Big Boy
", was released in 1968.
[36]
Bobby Taylor of
Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers
brought the Jackson 5 to
Motown
after they opened for Taylor at Chicago's
Regal Theater
in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of "
Who's Lovin' You
".
[37]
After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles.
[38]
In 1969, Motown executives decided
Diana Ross
should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public — partly to bolster her career in television — sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its "production line".
[39]
The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the
Miss Black America
pageant, performing a cover of "
It's Your Thing
".
[40]
Rolling Stone
later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts" who "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer".
[41]
In January 1970, "
I Want You Back
" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US
Billboard
Hot 100
; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "
ABC
", "
The Love You Save
", and "
I'll Be There
".
[42]
In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house at
Hayvenhurst
, a 2-acre (0.81 ha) estate in
Encino, California
.
[43]
During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a
teen idol
.
[44]
Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown:
Got to Be There
(1972),
Ben
(1972),
Music & Me
(1973) and
Forever, Michael
(1975).
[45]
"
Got to Be There
" and "
Ben
", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of
Bobby Day
's "
Rockin' Robin
".
[46]
Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5.
[45]
The Jackson 5 were later described as "a cutting-edge example of black
crossover artists
".
[47]
They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input.
[48]
Jackson's performance of their top five single "
Dancing Machine
" on
Soul Train
popularized the
robot dance
.

The Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, signing with
Epic Records
and renaming themselves the Jacksons.
[50]
Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career.
[51]
The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as "
Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)
" (1978), "
This Place Hotel
" (1980), and "
Can You Feel It
" (1980).
[52]
In 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the
Scarecrow
in
The Wiz
, a musical film directed by
Sidney Lumet
, alongside
Diana Ross
,
Nipsey Russell
, and Ted Ross.
[53]
The film was a box-office failure.
[54]
Its score was arranged by
Quincy Jones
,
[55]
who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums.
[56]
During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the
Studio 54
nightclub, where he heard early
hip hop
; this influenced his
beatboxing
on future tracks such as "
Working Day and Night
".
[57]
In 1978, Jackson broke his nose during a dance routine. A
rhinoplasty
led to breathing difficulties that later affected his career. He was referred to
Steven Hoefflin
, who performed Jackson's operations.
[58]
Jackson's fifth solo album,
Off the Wall
(1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the
bubblegum
pop of his youth to more complex sounds.
[44]
It produced four top 10 entries in the US: "
Off the Wall
", "
She's Out of My Life
", and the chart-topping singles "
Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough
" and "
Rock with You
".
[59]
The album reached number three on the US
Billboard
200
and sold over 20
million copies worldwide.
[60]
In 1980, Jackson won three
American Music Awards
for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".
[61]
[62]
He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".
[63]
In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.
[64]
Jackson felt
Off the Wall
should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.
[65]
In 1980, he secured the highest
royalty
rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.
[66]
Thriller
and
Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever
(1982-1983)
The sequined jacket and white glove worn by Jackson at
Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever
.
British Vogue
called Jackson "a fashion pioneer [...] who gave new meaning to
moonwalking
, immortalised solitary, [and] sparkly gloves".
[67]
Jackson recorded with
Queen
's lead singer
Freddie Mercury
from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "
State of Shock
", "Victory" and "
There Must Be More to Life Than This
". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen's manager
Jim Beach
, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a
llama
into the recording studio,
[68]
and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use.
[69]
"There Must Be More to Life Than This" was released in 2014.
[70]
Jackson went on to record "State of Shock" with
Mick Jagger
for the Jacksons' album
Victory
(1984).
[71]
In 1982, Jackson contributed "Someone in the Dark" to the
audiobook for the film
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
. Jackson's sixth album,
Thriller
, was released in late 1982. It was the bestselling album worldwide in 1983,
[72]
[73]
and became the bestselling album of all time in the US
[74]
and the
best-selling album of all time worldwide
, selling an estimated
70 million
copies.
[75]
[76]
It topped the
Billboard
200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to produce seven
Billboard
Hot 100 top-10 singles, including "
Billie Jean
", "
Beat It
", and "
Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
".
[77]
On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for
Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever
, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16 to an estimated audience of
47 million
, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars.
[78]
Jackson's solo performance of "Billie Jean" earned him his first
Emmy Award
nomination.
[79]
Wearing a glove decorated with
rhinestones
,
[80]
he debuted his
moonwalk dance
, which
Jeffrey Daniel
had taught him three years earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire.
[81]
Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too much television. But at the request of Motown founder
Berry Gordy
, he performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance.
[82]
Rolling Stone
reporter Mikal Gilmore called the performance "extraordinary".
[44]
Jackson's performance drew comparisons to
Elvis Presley
's and
the Beatles
' appearances on
The Ed Sullivan Show
.
[83]
Anna Kisselgoff
of
The New York Times
praised the perfect timing and technique involved in the dance.
[84]
Gordy described being "mesmerized" by the performance.
[85]
At the
26th Annual Grammy Awards
,
Thriller
won eight awards, and Jackson won an award for the
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
storybook. Winning eight Grammys in one ceremony is a record he holds with the band
Santana
.
[63]
Jackson and Quincy Jones won the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical).
Thriller
won Album of the Year (with Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-producer), and the single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for Jackson. "Beat It" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male). "Billie Jean" won two Grammy awards: Best R&B Song and Best R&B Vocal Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer respectively.
[63]
Thriller
won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical), acknowledging
Bruce Swedien
for his work on the album.
[86]
At the
11th Annual American Music Awards
, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit.
[87]
He also won Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. "Beat It" won Favorite Soul/R&B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album won Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.
[87]
[88]
Thriller
'
s sales doubled after the release of an extended music video,
Michael Jackson's Thriller
, which sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.
[89]
[90]
The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture.
[90]
Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point, with about $2 for every album sold (equivalent to $6 in 2022), and was making record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for $12 each.
[91]
In the same year,
The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller
, a documentary about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music Video (Longform).
[63]
Time
described Jackson's influence at that point as "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too."
[91]
The New York Times
wrote "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else".
[92]
On May 14, 1984, President
Ronald Reagan
gave Jackson an award recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities,
[93]
and in recognition of his support for the
Ad Council
's and the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
's Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use "Beat It" for its public service announcements.

In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with
PepsiCo
in a $5
million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to $14.7 million in 2022). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song "Billie Jean", with revised lyrics, as its
jingle
.
[95]
On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by
Phil Dusenberry
,
[96]
a
BBDO
ad agency executive, and
Alan Pottasch
, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the
Shrine Auditorium
in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing
second-degree burns
to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter.
[97]
Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5
million settlement to the
Brotman Medical Center
in
Culver City, California
; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor.
[98]
[99]
Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10
million. The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's
Bad
album and 1987-88 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as
LA Gear
,
Suzuki
, and
Sony
, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi.
[95]
The
Victory Tour
of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers.
[100]
Following
controversy over the concert's ticket sales
, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated
$3 to 5 million
, to charity.
[101]
During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the
Dodger Stadium
in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from the Jacksons during "Shake Your Body".
[102]
His charitable work continued with the release of "
We Are the World
" (1985), co-written with
Lionel Richie
,
[103]
which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa.
[104]
It earned $63
million (equivalent to $171 million in 2022),
[104]
and became one of the
best-selling singles of all time
, with 20
million copies sold.
[105]
It won four Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers.
[103]
The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the
USA for Africa
idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.

Jackson signing a "
We Are the World
" poster in 1985
Jackson collaborated with
Paul McCartney
in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making $40
million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs.
[104]
By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of
music catalogs
and song copyrights such as the
Sly Stone
collection included "Everyday People" (1968),
Len Barry
's "
1-2-3
" (1965), and
Dion DiMucci
's "
The Wanderer
" (1961) and "
Runaround Sue
" (1961).
In 1984,
Robert Holmes à Court
announced he was selling the
ATV Music Publishing
catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4,000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material.
[109]
In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20
million ($40
million).
[104]
[110]
Jackson submitted a bid of $46
million on November 20, 1984.
[109]
When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own.
[111]
[110]
Jackson's agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than $1
million and four months of
due diligence
work on the negotiations.
[109]
In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that
Charles Koppelman
's and
Marty Bandier
's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for $50
million; in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson's increased bid of $47.5
million (equivalent to $129 million in 2022) was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence.
[109]
Jackson agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the
Channel Seven Perth Telethon
.
[112]
His purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.
[104]
[109]
Increased tabloid speculation (1986-1987)

Health and appearance of Michael Jackson
Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been
bleaching his skin
.
[113]
[114]
[115]
His dermatologist,
Arnold Klein
, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had
vitiligo
,
[116]
a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also identified
discoid lupus erythematosus
in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year,
[116]
and with vitiligo in 1986.
[117]
Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup,
[118]
and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams,
[119]
to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale.
[120]
Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me."
[121]
He became friends with Klein and Klein's assistant,
Debbie Rowe
. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his first two children.
[122]
In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two
rhinoplasty
surgeries and a
cleft chin
surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer's body.
[123]
Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from
anorexia nervosa
. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life.
[124]
After his death, Jackson's mother said that he first turned to
cosmetic procedures
to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a "spotted cow". She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them.
[125]
In 1986, it was reported that Jackson slept in a
hyperbaric oxygen chamber
to slow aging. He denied the story,
[126]
although it was alleged that Jackson leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber (according to Jackson, this was a promotional shot from an
upcoming space opera featuring himself
) to
The National Enquirer
.
[127]
It was also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to
Elizabeth Taylor
and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's manager
Frank DiLeo
denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added "I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a health fanatic."
[128]
When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee
Bubbles
to tour in Japan, the media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring
Disney
cartoon character who befriended animals.
[129]
It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of
Joseph Merrick
(the "Elephant Man").
[130]
In June 1987, the
Chicago Tribune
reported Jackson's publicist bidding $1
million for the skeleton to the
London Hospital Medical College
on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an "absorbing interest" in Merrick, "purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical significance."
[131]
In September 1986, using the oxygen chamber story, the British tabloid
The Sun
branded Jackson "Wacko Jacko", a name Jackson came to despise.
[10]
[132]
The Atlantic
noted that the name "Jacko" has racist connotations, as it originates from
Jacko Macacco
, a monkey used in
monkey-baiting
matches at the
Westminster Pit
in the early 1820s, and "Jacko" was used in
Cockney slang
to refer to monkeys in general.
[133]
Jackson worked with
George Lucas
and
Francis Ford Coppola
on the 17-minute $30
million
3D film
Captain EO
, which ran from 1986 at
Disneyland
and
Epcot
, and later at
Tokyo Disneyland
and
Euro Disneyland
.
[134]
After having been removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's death.
[135]
In 1987,
Ebony
reported that Jackson had disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses.
[136]
Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the
Thriller
video,
[137]
which Michael denounced in a Witness publication in 1984.
[138]
In 2001, Jackson told an interviewer he was still a Jehovah's Witness.
[139]
Bad

Jackson's first album in five years,
Bad
(1987), was highly anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success.
[140]
It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: "
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
", "
Bad

million copies worldwide.
[143]
[144]

Bad World Tour
ran from September 12, 1987, to January 14, 1989.
[145]
In Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record for a single tour.
[146]
The 504,000 people who attended seven sold-out shows at
Wembley Stadium
set a new
Guinness World Record
.
[147]
In 1988, Jackson released his autobiography,
Moonwalk
, with input from Stephen Davis and
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
.
[148]
It sold 200,000 copies,
[149]
and reached the top of the
New York Times
bestsellers list.
[150]
Jackson discussed his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse from his father.
[151]
He attributed his changing facial appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting.
[152]
[123]
In June, Jackson was honored with the Grand Vermeil
Medal of the City of Paris
by the then Mayor of Paris
Jacques Chirac
during his stay in the city as part of the
Bad World Tour
.
[153]
[154]
In October, Jackson released a film,
Moonwalker
, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and
Joe Pesci
. In the US it was released
direct-to-video
and became the bestselling video cassette in the country.
[155]
[156]
The
Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA) certified it as eight times Platinum in the US.
[157]
In March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11 km
2
) of land near
Santa Ynez, California
, to build a new home,
Neverland Ranch
, at a cost of $17
million (equivalent to $42 million in 2022).
[158]
He installed a
Ferris wheel
, a
carousel
, a movie theater and a zoo.
[158]
[159]
[160]
A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds.
[159]
Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first Western television advertisement in the
Soviet Union
.
[161]
Jackson became known as the "
King of Pop
", a nickname that Jackson's publicists embraced.
[24]
[162]
[163]
When
Elizabeth Taylor
presented him with the Soul Train Heritage Award in 1989, she called him "the true king of pop, rock and soul."
[164]
President
George H. W. Bush
designated him the White House's "Artist of the Decade".
[165]
From 1985 to 1990, Jackson donated $455,000 to the
United Negro College Fund
,
[166]
and all profits from his single "Man in the Mirror" went to charity.
[167]
His rendition of "You Were There" at
Sammy Davis Jr.
's 60th birthday celebration won Jackson a second Emmy nomination.
[79]
Jackson was the bestselling artist of the 1980s.
[168]

,
[169]
beating
Neil Diamond

in a chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals.
[176]
In the UK, "

[177]
Jackson during the
Dangerous World Tour
in 1993.

[185]
In January 1993, Jackson performed at the
Super Bowl XXVII halftime show
in Pasadena, California. The
NFL
sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures.
[188]
[189]
It was the first Super Bowl whose half-time performance drew greater audience figures than the game. Jackson played "
Jam
", "Billie Jean", "Black or White", and "Heal the World".
Dangerous
rose 90 places in the US albums chart after the performance.
[113]
Jackson gave
a 90-minute interview
with
Oprah Winfrey
on February 10, 1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. After the interview,
Dangerous
re-entered the US albums chart in the top 10, more than a year after its release.

First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993-1995)
Main article:
1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson
In August 1993, Jackson was accused of
child sexual abuse
by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler.
[193]
Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing,
masturbation
and
oral sex
.
[194]
While Jordan's mother initially told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested him, her position wavered a few days later.
[195]
[196]
Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father trying to extort money.
[196]
Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile;
[197]
she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband.
[198]
Police raided Jackson's home in August and found two legal large-format art books featuring young boys playing, running and swimming in various states of undress.
[199]
Jackson denied knowing of the books' content and claimed if they were there someone had to send them to him and he did not open them.
[200]
Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's genitals. A strip search was made, and the jurors felt the description was not a match.
[201]
[202]
[203]
In January 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandlers out of court for a reported total sum of $23 million.
[204]
The police never pressed criminal charges.
[205]
Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's testimony, the state closed its investigation on September 22, 1994.
[206]
Jackson had been taking
painkillers
for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations.
[207]
On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close friend
Elizabeth Taylor
for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi.
[208]
In late 1993, Jackson proposed to
Lisa Marie Presley
, the daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone.
[209]
They married in
La Vega, Dominican Republic
, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez.
[210]
The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer.
[211]
[210]
Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995.
[212]
Presley cited "irreconcilable differences" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement.
[211]
[213]
After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, "They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half."
[210]
Presley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him.
[214]
Jackson composed music for the
Sega Genesis
video game
Sonic the Hedgehog 3
(1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited.
[215]
[216]
The
Sega Technical Institute
director Roger Hector and the
Sonic
co-creator
Naoto Ohshima
said that Jackson's involvement was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations.
[217]
[218]
However, Jackson's musical director
Brad Buxer
and other members of Jackson's team said Jackson went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music.

[221]
HIStory

[63]
The
New York Times
reviewed it as "the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent".
[222]
The first single from
HIStory
was "
Scream
/
Childhood
". "Scream", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the
Billboard
Hot 100,
[175]
and received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals".
[63]

You Are Not Alone
", holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on the
Billboard
Hot 100 chart.
[223]
It received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Vocal Performance" in 1995.
[63]
In 1995 the
Anti-Defamation League
and other groups complained that "Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me,
kike
me, don't you black or white me", the original lyrics of "
They Don't Care About Us
", were
antisemitic
. Jackson released a version with revised words.

panic attack
.
[225]

million up front (equivalent to $182 million in 2022) as well as the
rights to more songs
.
[226]
[227]
"
Earth Song
" was the third single released from
HIStory
, and topped the
UK Singles Chart
for six weeks over Christmas 1995.
[177]
It became the 87th-bestselling single in the UK.
[228]
At the
1996 Brit Awards
, Jackson's performance of "Earth Song" was disrupted by
Pulp
singer
Jarvis Cocker
, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's "Christ-like" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was "disgusting and cowardly".
[229]
[230]
In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for "Scream" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.
[63]
[231]
In July 1996, Jackson performed for
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah
's fiftieth birthday at
Jerudong Park Amphitheater
, which was specifically built for that birthday concert.
[232]
Jackson was reportedly paid $17 million (equivalent to $32 million in 2022).
[233]
Jackson promoted
HIStory
with the
HIStory World Tour
, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5
million fans, his most attended tour. It grossed
$165 million
.
[145]
During the tour, in Sydney, Australia, Jackson married
Debbie Rowe
, a dermatology assistant, who was six months pregnant with his first child.
[234]
Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997. His sister
Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson
was born on April 3, 1998.
[235]
Jackson and Rowe divorced in 2000, Rowe conceded custody of the children, with an $8
million settlement (equivalent to $14.1 million in 2022).
[236]
In 2004, after the
second child abuse allegations against Jackson
, she returned to court to reclaim custody. The suit was settled in 2006.
[237]
In 1997, Jackson released
Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix

copies, making it the
best-selling remix album
. It reached number one in the UK, as did the single "
Blood on the Dance Floor
".
[238]

[172]
Label dispute and
Invincible
(1997-2002)
From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album,
Invincible
, which cost
$30 million
to record, making it the
most expensive album
of all time.
[239]
In June 1999, Jackson joined
Luciano Pavarotti
for a
War Child
benefit concert in
Modena, Italy
. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the
Kosovo War
, and additional funds for the children of
Guatemala
.
[240]
Later that month, Jackson organized a series of "
Michael Jackson & Friends
" benefit concerts in Germany and
Korea
. Other artists involved included
Slash
,
The Scorpions
,
Boyz II Men
,
Luther Vandross
,
Mariah Carey
,
A. R. Rahman
,
Prabhu Deva
Sundaram,
Shobana

, the
Red Cross
and
UNESCO
.
[241]
In 1999, Jackson was presented with the "Outstanding Humanitarian Award" at
Bollywood Movie Awards
in New York City where he noted
Mahatma Gandhi
to have been an inspiration for him.
[242]
[243]
From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4
East 74th Street
.
[244]
At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s.
[245]
In 2000,
Guinness World Records
recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.
[246]
In September 2001, two
30th Anniversary concerts
were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured
Mýa
,
Usher
,
Whitney Houston
,
Destiny's Child
,
Monica
,
Liza Minnelli
and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by
Marlon Brando
.
[247]
Almost 30
million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November.
[248]
After the
September 11 attacks
(in which Jackson narrowly avoided death by oversleeping and missing a scheduled meeting at the
World Trade Center
[249]
), Jackson helped organize the
United We Stand: What More Can I Give
benefit concert at
RFK Stadium
in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed "
What More Can I Give
" as the finale.
[250]
The release of
Invincible
was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.
[251]
Invincible
was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime.
[251]
It debuted at number one in 13 countries, and went on to sell eight
million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US.
[172]
[252]
[253]
On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century.
[254]
[255]
Later that year, an anonymous
surrogate mother
gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed "Blanket"
[a]
), who had been conceived by
artificial insemination
.
[256]
On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".
[257]
On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts.
[258]
In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3
million.
[259]
[260]
On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.
[261]
On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at
Apollo Theater
. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton.
[262]
The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5
million.
[263]
The concert was called
Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo
and was one of Jackson's final on-stage performances.
[264]
In July 2002, Jackson called Sony Music chairman
Tommy Mottola
"a racist, and very, very, very devilish," and someone who exploits black artists for his own gain, at
Al Sharpton
's
National Action Network
in Harlem. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists.
[265]
Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague
Irv Gotti
a "fat
nigger
".
[266]
Responding to those attacks, Sony issued a statement calling them "ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful" and defended Mottola as someone who had championed Jackson's career for many years.
[265]
Sony ultimately refused to renew Jackson's contract and claimed that a
$25 million
promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for
Invincible
.

The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as
Living with Michael Jackson
, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a twelve-year-old boy.
[23]
[267]
He said that he saw nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.
[268]
[269]
In October 2003, Jackson received the
Key to the City
of
Las Vegas
from Mayor
Oscar Goodman
.
[270]

alcoholic drinks
.
[272]
Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty.
[273]
The
People v. Jackson
trial began on January 31, 2005, in
Santa Maria, California
, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to twenty years in prison.
[274]
On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.
[275]

In June 2005, he moved to
Bahrain
as a guest of
Sheikh Abdullah
.
[279]
In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain startup, Two Seas Records. Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO,
Guy Holmes
, later said it was never finalized.
[280]
[281]
Holmes also found that Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy and was involved in 47 ongoing lawsuits.
[279]
By September 2006, Jackson was no longer affiliated with Two Seas.
[281]
In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about $1
billion, as
collateral
against his $270
million worth of loans from
Bank of America
. Bank of America had sold the loans to
Fortress Investments
, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of $300
million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to $440 million in 2022). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy.
[227]
[282]
The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Abdullah.
[283]
At least thirty of Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages. Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties.
[227]
Jackson never returned to Neverland after his acquittal.
[284]
In mid-2006, Jackson moved to
Grouse Lodge
, a residential recording studio near
Rosemount, County Westmeath
, Ireland. There, he began work on a new album with the American producers
will.i.am
and
Rodney Jenkins
.
[285]
That November, Jackson invited an
Access Hollywood
camera crew into the studio in Westmeath.
[174]
On November 15, Jackson briefly joined in on a performance of "We Are the World" at the
World Music Awards
in London, his last public performance, and accepted the Diamond Award for sales of
100 million
records.
[174]
[286]
He returned to the US in December, settling in Las Vegas. That month, he attended
James Brown
's funeral in
Augusta, Georgia
, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown his greatest inspiration.

[289]
In a brief interview, Jackson said he had no regrets about his career despite his problems and "deliberate attempts to hurt [him]".
[290]
That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan,
Camp Zama
, to greet more than 3,000 troops and their families.
[291]
[292]
As of September, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed.
[293]
In 2008, for the 25th anniversary of
Thriller
, Jackson and Sony released
Thriller 25
, with two remixes released as singles: "
The Girl Is Mine 2008
" and "
Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008
".
[294]
For Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums,
King of Pop
,
with different tracklists for different regions.
[295]
That July, Fortress Investments threatened to
foreclose
on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to
Colony Capital
LLC.
[296]
[297]
In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him
$35 million
.
[298]
In 2009, Jackson arranged to sell a collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through
Julien's Auction House
, but canceled the auction in April.
[299]
In March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson announced a series of comeback concerts,
This Is It
, at a press conference at
the O2 Arena
.
[300]
The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for ten concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, the president and chief executive of
AEG Live
, predicted the first ten dates would earn Jackson £50
million.
[301]
The London residency was increased to fifty dates after record-breaking ticket sales; more than one million were sold in less than two hours.
[302]
The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of the choreographer
Kenny Ortega
, whom he had worked with during his previous tours. Rehearsals took place at
the Forum
and the
Staples Center
owned by AEG.
[303]
By this point, Jackson's debt had grown to almost $500 million. By the time of his death, he was three or four months behind payments of his home in San Fernando Valley.
[304]
[305]
The Independent
reported that Jackson planned a string of further ventures designed to recoup his debts, including a world tour, a new album, films, a museum and a casino.

[380]
Posthumous child sexual abuse allegations
Jackson and Safechuck (right) in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988
In 2013, the choreographer
Wade Robson
filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old (1989-1996).
[381]
In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten (1988-1992).
[382]
[383]
[384]
Both had testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005.
[385]
[386]
In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed as it had been filed too late. Safechuck's claim was also time-barred.
[387]
In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions.
[388]
[389]
The rulings were appealed. On October 20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's corporations was again dismissed. The judge ruled that there was no evidence that Safechuck had had a relationship with Jackson's corporation, nor was it proven that there was a special relationship between the two.
[390]
[391]
[392]
[393]
On April 26, 2021, Robson's case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the defendants exercised control over Jackson.
[394]
Robson and Safechuck described their allegations against Jackson in graphic detail in the documentary
Leaving Neverland
, released in March 2019.
[395]
Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their playlists.
[396]
[397]
[398]
Jackson's family condemned the film as a "public lynching",
[399]
and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a "tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death".
[400]
Close associates of Jackson, such as
Corey Feldman
,
Aaron Carter
, Brett Barnes, and
Macaulay Culkin
, said that Jackson had not molested them.
[401]
[402]
[403]
Documentaries such as
Square One: Michael Jackson
,
Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary
and
Michael Jackson: Chase the Truth
, presented information countering the claims suggested by
Leaving Neverland
.
[404]
[405]
[406]
Jackson's album sales increased following the documentary screenings.
[407]
Billboard
senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the controversy.
[408]
In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists, citing "positive listener survey results".
[409]
[410]
On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100
million or more in damages awarded to the estate.
[411]
HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-
SLAPP
motion against the estate. In September 2019, Judge
George H. Wu
denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate.
[412]
HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeals court affirmed Wu's ruling.
[413]
In 2020, a state law passed in California which granted plaintiffs in child sex abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits. In October 2020 and again in April 2021, the
Los Angeles County Superior Court
ruled that MJJ Productions Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc. employees were not legally obligated to protect the two men from Jackson. In August 2023, Californias Second District Court of Appeal overturned the ruling, and the case was approved to move forward to
trial court
.

Cultural impact of Michael Jackson
and
List of Michael Jackson records and achievements
Jackson has been referred to as the "
King of Pop
" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.
[415]
His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.
[416]
Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring.
[44]
In songs such as "
Man in the Mirror
", "
Black or White
", "
Heal the World
", "
Earth Song
" and "
They Don't Care About Us
", Jackson's music emphasized
racial integration
and environmentalism and protested injustice.
[417]
[418]
He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by
Guinness World Records
.
[419]
[420]
Jackson has also appeared on
Rolling Stone
'
s lists of the Greatest Singers of All Time.
[421]
[422]
He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century,
[423]
and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.
[424]
[425]
[426]
Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of
Thriller
'
s colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who
weren't
trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.
—
J. Edward Keyes of
Rolling Stone
[427]
Danyel Smith
, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of
Vibe
,
described Jackson as "the greatest star".
[428]
Steve Huey of AllMusic called him "an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power".
[10]
BET said Jackson was "quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time" whose "sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres".
[429]
Jackson's
Bad
era wax figure at
Madame Tussauds
, London in 1992
In 1984,
Time
pop critic
Jay Cocks
wrote that "Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever." He described Jackson as a "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and color too."
[91]
In 2003,
The Daily Telegraph
writer
Tom Utley
described Jackson as "extremely important" and a "genius".
[430]
At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson "the greatest entertainer that ever lived".
[431]
[432]
In a June 28, 2009
Baltimore Sun
article, Jill Rosen wrote that Jackson's legacy influenced fields including sound, dance, fashion, music videos and celebrity.
[433]
Pop critic
Robert Christgau
wrote that Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed "immense originality, adaptability, and ambition" with "genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)", music that "will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it". During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his "troubling life", his music suffered and began to shape "an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo".
[434]
In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: "Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten".
[435]
Philanthropy and humanitarian work
Main article:
Philanthropy of Michael Jackson
Jackson is regarded as a prolific philanthropist and humanitarian.
[436]
[437]
[438]
[439]
Jackson's early charitable work has been described by
The Chronicle of Philanthropy
as having "paved the way for the current surge in celebrity philanthropy",
[440]
and by the
Los Angeles Times
as having "set the standard for generosity for other entertainers".
[436]
By some estimates, he donated over $500 million, not accounting for inflation, to various charities over the course of his life.
[436]
In 1992, Jackson established his
Heal the World Foundation
, to which he donated several million dollars in revenue from his
Dangerous World Tour
.
[

Jackson's philanthropic activities went beyond just monetary donations. He also performed at
benefit concerts
, some of which he arranged. He gifted tickets for his regular concert performances to groups that assist underprivileged children. He visited sick children in hospitals around the world. He opened his own home for visits by underprivileged or sick children and provided special facilities and nurses if the children needed that level of care.
Jackson donated valuable, personal and professional paraphernalia for numerous charity auctions. He received various awards and accolades for his philanthropic work, including two bestowed by presidents of the United States. The vast breadth of Jackson's philanthropic work has earned recognition in the
Guinness World Records
.

Artistry
Influences
Jackson was influenced by musicians including
James Brown
,
Little Richard
,
Jackie Wilson
,
Diana Ross
,
Fred Astaire
,
Sammy Davis Jr
.,
Gene Kelly
,
[443]
and
David Ruffin
.
[444]
Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,
[445]
but Brown was his greatest inspiration; he later said that as a small child, his mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being "mesmerized".
[446]
Jackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the
oooh
interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with
the Supremes
.
[447]
She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched her rehearse.
[448]
He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself.
[449]
Choreographer
David Winters
, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special
Diana!
, said that Jackson watched the musical
West Side Story
almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in "Beat It" and the "Bad" video.
[450]
[451]
[452]
Vocal style
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy
soprano
to lyric
tenor
.
[453]
He was known for his vocal range.
[421]
With the arrival of
Off the Wall
in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded;
Rolling Stone
compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling
falsetto
that's used very daringly."
[454]
By the time of 1982's
Thriller
,
Rolling Stone
wrote that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".
[455]
The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album
Dangerous
.
The New York Times
noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.
[456]
Of
Invincible
,
Rolling Stone
wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".
[457]
Joseph Vogel
notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion.
[458]
Neil McCormick
wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was original and utterly distinctive".
[459]
Musicianship
Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write
music notation
. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but was not proficient in them.
[460]
When composing, he recorded ideas by
beatboxing
and imitating instruments vocally.
[460]
Describing the process, he said: "I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody." The engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder.
[460]
Dance
Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5,
[461]
and incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music videos.
[461]
According to Sanjoy Roy of
The Guardian
, Jackson would "flick and retract his limbs like switchblades, or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand".
[461]
The
moonwalk
, taught to him by
Jeffrey Daniel
,
[81]
was Jackson's signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century.
[462]
Jackson is credited for coining the name "moonwalk"; the move was previously known as the "backslide".
[463]
[464]
His other moves included the
robot
,
[49]
crotch grab, and the "anti-gravity" lean of the "Smooth Criminal" video.
[461]
Themes and genres

Steve Huey of
AllMusic
wrote that
Thriller
refined the strengths of
Off the Wall
; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.
[10]
Its tracks included the ballads "The Lady in My Life", "
Human Nature
", and "
The Girl Is Mine
",
[469]
[455]
[470]
the funk pieces "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'",
[469]
[455]
and the disco set "
Baby Be Mine
" and "
P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)
".
[470]
With
Off the Wall
, Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult,
Robert Christgau
wrote in
Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies
(1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and
Stevie Wonder
's "oddball" music personas: "Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed."
[471]
With
Thriller
, Christopher Connelly of
Rolling Stone
commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of
paranoia
and darker imagery.
[455]
AllMusic's
Stephen Thomas Erlewine
noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".
[469]
In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child,
[10]
and in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the media.
[455]
"Beat It" decried gang violence in a homage to
West Side Story
, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.
[10]
[41]
He observed that "
Thriller
" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the
supernatural
, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem "We Are the World"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.
[10]
Jackson's
Bad
era jacket on display at the
Hollywood
Guinness World Records
Museum
In
Bad
, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song "Dirty Diana".
[472]
The lead single "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" is a traditional love ballad, and "Man in the Mirror" is a ballad of confession and resolution. "
Smooth Criminal
" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder.
[140]
AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that
Dangerous
presents Jackson as a paradoxical person.
[473]
The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like "Jam" and "Remember the Time". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs.
Dangerous
contains sexually charged songs such as "
In the Closet
". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as "
Will You Be There
", "Heal the World" and "Keep the Faith".
[456]
In the ballad "
Gone Too Soon
", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.
[474]
HIStory
creates an atmosphere of paranoia.
[475]
In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks "Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie", and the R&B ballad "
You Are Not Alone
", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media.
[476]
In the introspective ballad "
Stranger in Moscow
", Jackson laments his "fall from grace"; "Earth Song", "Childhood", "Little Susie" and "Smile" are operatic pop songs.
[475]
[476]
In "
D.S.
", Jackson attacks lawyer
Thomas W. Sneddon Jr.
, who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive".
[477]
Invincible
includes urban soul tracks such as "
Cry
" and "The Lost Children", ballads such as "
Speechless
", "Break of Dawn", and "Butterflies", and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker" and "Invincible".

Music videos and choreography
Jackson (center) performing a dance sequence of "
The Way You Make Me Feel
" at the Bad World Tour in 1988
Jackson released "
Thriller
", a 14-minute music video directed by
John Landis
, in 1983.
[480]
The
zombie
-themed video "defined music videos and broke racial barriers" on
MTV
, which had launched two years earlier.
[44]
Before
Thriller
, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American.
[481]
Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat It", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other black music artists gain recognition.
[482]
The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B.
[482]
[483]
His performance on
Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever
changed the scope of live stage shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage.
[484]
The choreography in
Thriller
has been copied in
Indian films
and
prisons in the Philippines
.
[485]
Thriller
marked an increase in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music video ever by the
Guinness World Records
.
[223]
In "Bad"'s 19-minute video—directed by
Martin Scorsese
—Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music.
Time
magazine described the "Bad" video as "infamous". It featured
Wesley Snipes
; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles.
[486]
[487]
For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted
for the device.
[488]
The video for "Leave Me Alone" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three
Billboard
Music Video Awards
[489]
and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for
Best Music Video, Short Form
.
[63]
He received the
MTV Video Vanguard Award
in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor.
[490]
The "Black or White" video simultaneously premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500
million people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time.
[174]
Along with Jackson, it featured
Macaulay Culkin
,
Peggy Lipton
, and
George Wendt
. It helped introduce
morphing
to music videos.
[491]
It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video.
[163]
"In the Closet" featured

Earnings
Main article:
Estate of Michael Jackson
In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125
million.
[223]
Forbes
placed Jackson's annual income at $35
million in 1996 and $20
million in 1997.
[528]
Estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative $285
million to positive $350
million for 2002, 2003 and 2007.
[529]
[530]
Forbes
reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2
billion.
[531]
[532]
Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300
million in royalties. He may have earned another $400
million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos.
[533]
In 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the
United States Tax Court
as a result of a dispute with the
Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) over
US federal estate taxes
.
[534]
The executors claim that it was worth about $7
million, the IRS that it was worth over $1.1
billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed $702
million; $505
million in taxes, and $197
million in penalties.
[535]
A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017.
[536]
In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in favor of the estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value of the estate was $111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was $4 million (not the $61 million estimated by the IRS's outside expert witness).
[537]
In 2016,
Forbes
estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at $825
million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog.
[538]
In 2018, the figure was $400
million.
[539]
It was the eighth year since his death that Jackson's annual earnings were reported to be over $100
million, thus bringing Jackson's postmortem total to $2.4
billion.
[540]
Forbes
has consistently recognized Jackson as one of the
top-earning dead celebrities
since his death, and placed him at the top spot from 2013 to 2020.

OrthoDB

[2]
[3]
[4]
presents a catalog of
orthologous
protein-coding genes across
vertebrates
,
arthropods
,
fungi
,
plants
, and
bacteria
. Orthology refers to the last common ancestor of the species under consideration, and thus OrthoDB explicitly delineates orthologs at each major radiation along the species phylogeny. The database of orthologs presents available protein descriptors, together with
Gene Ontology
and
InterPro
attributes, which serve to provide general descriptive annotations of the orthologous groups, and facilitate comprehensive orthology database querying.
OrthoDB
also provides computed evolutionary traits of orthologs, such as gene duplicability and loss profiles, divergence rates, sibling groups, and gene intron-exon architectures.
In
comparative genomics
, the importance of scale cannot be underestimated. As gene orthology delineation requires specific expertise and considerable computational resources, scale is something that individual non-specialist research groups cannot accomplish on their own. This challenging task is achieved by
OrthoDB
, with very comprehensive sets of species and several unique features such as the extensive functional and evolutionary annotations of orthologous groups, with the integration of many useful links to other world-leading databases that focus on capturing information about gene function. No genome can exist as a useful data source without extensive comparative analyses with other genomes -
OrthoDB
provides a critically important resource for comparative genomics for the entire community of researchers from those interested in grand evolutionary questions to those focused on the specific biological functions of individual genes.
Methodology
[
edit
]
Orthology is defined relative to the last common ancestor of the species being considered, thereby determining the hierarchical nature of orthologous classifications. This is explicitly addressed in
OrthoDB
by application of the orthology delineation procedure at each major radiation point of the considered phylogeny. The
OrthoDB
implementation employs a Best-Reciprocal-Hit (BRH) clustering algorithm based on all-against-all
Smith-Waterman
protein sequence comparisons. Gene set pre-processing selects the longest protein-coding transcript of alternatively spliced genes and of very similar gene copies. The procedure triangulates BRHs to progressively build the clusters and requires an overall minimum sequence alignment overlap to avoid domain walking. These core clusters are further expanded to include all more closely related within-species in-paralogs, and the previously identified very similar gene copies.
Data content
[
edit
]
The database contains some 600 eukaryotic species and more than 3600 bacteria
[1]
sourced from
Ensembl
,
UniProt
,
NCBI
,
FlyBase
, and several other databases. The ever-increasing sampling of sequenced genomes brings a clearer account of the majority of gene genealogies that will facilitate informed hypotheses of gene function in newly sequenced genomes.
Examples of studies that have employed data from
OrthoDB
include
comparative analyses of gene repertoire evolution
,
[5]
[6]
comparisons of fruit fly and mosquito developmental genes
,
[7]
analyses of bloodmeal- or infection-induced changes in gene expression in mosquitoes
,
[8]
[9]
[10]
analysis of the evolution of mammalian milk production
,
[11]
and
mosquito gene and genome evolution
.

Performance
[
edit
]
OrthoDB
has performed consistently well in benchmarking assessments alongside other orthology delineation procedures. Results were compared to reference trees for three well-conserved protein families,
[13]
and to a larger set of curated protein families.

[15]
- Orthologous groups are selected from
OrthoDB
for the root-level classifications of arthropods, vertebrates, metazoans, fungi, and other major clades. Groups are required to contain single-copy orthologs in at least 90% of the species (in others they may be lost or duplicated), and the missing species cannot all be from the same clade. Species with frequent losses or duplications are removed from the selection unless they hold a key position in the phylogeny.
BUSCOs
are therefore expected to be found as single-copy orthologs in any newly sequenced genome from the appropriate phylogenetic clade, and can be used to analyse newly sequenced genomes to assess their relative completeness. The
BUSCO
assessment tool and datasets (accessible
) are being widely used in many genomics projects, with most journal editors now requiring such quality assessments before accepting new genome publications.

Status

Ashton Canal at
Droylsden
The Cheshire Ring
is a
canal
cruising circuit or
canal ring
, which includes sections of six canals in and around
Cheshire
and
Greater Manchester
in
North West England
: the
Ashton Canal
,
Peak Forest Canal
,
Macclesfield Canal
,
Trent and Mersey Canal
,
Bridgewater Canal
and
Rochdale Canal
.
Because it takes boats approximately one week to complete the circuit, it is suited to
narrowboat
holidays that start at and return to the same location. The route has 92
locks
and is 97 miles (156 km) long. It passes through contrasting landscapes between
Manchester city centre
and rural Cheshire with views of the
Peak District
and the
Cheshire Plain
.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The term "Cheshire Ring" first appeared in the
Inland Waterways Association
(IWA) Bulletin in 1965,
[2]
where it was coined as part of a campaign to prevent the abandonment of, and restore navigation to, part of what had been known as the Peak Forest Circular Route between
Manchester
and
Marple
. When commercial carrying declined after the Second World War, sections of the
Rochdale
,
Ashton
and
Peak Forest
canals that make up the urban part of the ring had gradually fallen into disuse, and by the early 1960s were impassable, with little depth of water and many locks in an unusable condition. There was a risk that the canals would be abandoned, and infilled, as they were becoming stinking eyesores. Perseverance by the IWA and the Peak Forest Canal Society paid off, and on 1 April 1974, following restoration, the ring was re-opened to navigation.
The Rochdale Canal (unlike most other canals in England) was not nationalised in 1947, and remained in the ownership of the Rochdale Canal Company. Both the Rochdale Canal and
Bridgewater Canal
escaped nationalisation as a result of being owned subsidiaries of the
Manchester Ship Canal
company.
In 2002, as part of the restoration of the Rochdale, ownership of the Rochdale Canal Company passed to the Waterways Trust, and
British Waterways
became the navigation authority, bringing to an end the £35 toll that had been charged to use the one-mile section through Manchester which had deterred some boats from attempting the ring.
Cheshire Ring Race
[
edit
]
Since 1977, a marathon-style 96-mile (154 km) canoeing race has been organized called the Cheshire Ring Race. Traversing five canals, it starts and finishes at Higher Poynton on the Macclesfield Canal. Participation is open to individual paddlers, crew boats and relay teams. The race is held under the aegis of Macclesfield And District Canoe Club (MADCC).

Dragonus takes to the streets of Galway for GIAF 2014
The
Galway International Arts Festival
(GIAF), founded in 1978, is a cultural organization that produces an annual arts festival in
Galway
, Ireland. It also produces new work that tours nationally and internationally, in addition to presenting the discussion forum, "First Thought Talks". The festival maintains a non-profit status.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The Galway Arts Festival organization was founded in 1978 by
University College Galway
's Arts Society in collaboration with community activists from the Galway Arts Group. The first festival was described in local papers as "Galway Arts Society's Week of
Craic
". Their original budget was €1000 of Arts Council Funding and most of the artistic events were staged in an arts centre that now houses Sheridan's Cheesemongers.
[2]
The name was changed in 2014 to the Galway International Arts Festival to emphasize the diversity of contributors to the festival. "The festival presents and produces work in Galway which sits side by side with the work of artists and companies from around the world," Artistic Director Paul Fahy stated.
[
tone
]
The name change also facilitated the vision of the festival as a producing body, creating works that tour internationally.
[3]
Festival
[
edit
]
The festival takes place in Galway for two weeks in late July. It presents and produces programmes across theatre, music, visual arts, opera, street spectacle, dance, discussion, and comedy. The 2018 festival set records for attendance, breaking a quarter million for the first time, representing a 20% increase over the participants in the 2017 festival.
[4]
Over 600 artists created and took part in over 200 events across the festival. This 41st festival also featured a new Festival Garden in Eyre Square, offering pop-up performances and local food stands. The Festival Garden attracted more than 145,000 people. Visitors to the 2017 festival were estimated to be 45% from Galway, 18% around the rest of Ireland, and 37% outside of Ireland.
[5]
Touring
[
edit
]
The organisation has produced or co-produced more than 20 productions which have toured to London, New York, Edinburgh, Chicago, Adelaide, Sydney, Hong Kong, and Washington.
[6]
These include four exhibition commissions.
[7]
GIAF has also fostered a relationship with
Landmark Productions
, a Dublin-based production company. Together, they have produced multiple works written by or directed by Irish playwright
Enda Walsh
that have toured internationally.

John Hampden Grammar School
(known colloquially as "JHGS") is a
selective
state
boys'
grammar school
in
High Wycombe
,
Buckinghamshire
,
England
. It is named after the local
member of parliament
and
English Civil War
commander
John Hampden
. In June 2011, the school became an
Academy
.
Established as the
Schools of Science and Art
in 1893, it is situated on Marlow Hill to the south of the town and has a capacity of about 1,150 boys aged between 11 and 18.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
Early origins as the Schools of Science and Art: 1893-1915
[
edit
]
In the early 1890s a fund was set up to raise money for an art and technical school in
High Wycombe
to help support the traditional skills in the town of cabinet making, carving and polishing. Early donations to the fund included a grant of £575 from the School of Art in
Kensington Gardens
and a further donation from
Buckinghamshire County Council
's education fund which had benefited from proceeds derived from an unpopular tax imposed on wines and spirits. To make up the shortfall needed to pay for the building the schools' trustees and general committee ran a three-day fair in the grounds of
Wycombe Abbey
, the home of the then
Lord Carrington
. The fête took place in July 1892, with Lady Carrington arriving by a special train from Paddington. The
Great Western Railway
also ran excursions from
Maidenhead
,
Thame
,
Aylesbury
and
Chinnor
and the revelries were led by the band of the 17th Lancers. By the end of the event the committee had raised £800.
[5]
The school was originally built on 530 square yards of land in Frogmore Gardens (now known as 'Frogmoor' or 'Frogmore') purchased from Lord Carrington for £325. The building work cost £1,964 and when the school opened there was still a shortfall of £230, some of which was met by a further bazaar. The original building was designed by Arthur Vernon who also designed the
RGS
building and was the first man to own a car in
High Wycombe
. In 1901 the trustees allowed girls to be taught in separate classes and teachers and this arrangement continued until 1906 when the girls moved to buildings in Benjamin Road, ultimately becoming
Wycombe High School
. Courses were run at the school at all times of the day but most were in the evenings and weekends so that pupils could also work in the local furniture trade.
Technical Institute and moving from Frogmoor: 1915-1966
[
edit
]
Soon after the Schools of Science and Art opened the Frogmoor building, it became clear it was too small and a new site was discussed. In 1915 the
Royal Grammar School
moved to new buildings on Amersham Hill and it was suggested that the school (now usually referred to as
Chepping Wycombe Science and Art Schools and Technical Institute
) moved into the now vacated buildings in Easton Street (also designed by Arthur Vernon). Unfortunately the outbreak of the
First World War
meant that the
Wycombe High School
buildings were needed as a hospital so the girls moved into Easton Street and the boys had to wait. The Institute finally moved to Easton Street in 1919 and soon there was a significant expansion. Firstly the
1918 Education Act
raised the school leaving age to 14 and it was decided to set up a Junior Day Technical School as part of the institute. This would be a full-time school. At the same time the Institute set up a training school for ex-soldiers and sailors who had become disabled in the war to prepare them for the furniture trade. The Easton Street buildings also soon proved too small and were significantly expanded and a series of wooden huts were installed to be used as classrooms. The Frogmoor school continued to be used after the move to Easton Street and was finally sold in 1928 (for £3,500).
[6]
It has since been used for a number of different purposes including a swimming pool and is now a
dentist
's practice.
In 1920, the Day School opened and technical classes in metalwork and woodwork were introduced - the first in the country. The schools changed their names to Wycombe Technical Institute and tuition was offered in most subjects (except French). Although the School of Art continued to be part of the Institute it was often considered a separate entity and it moved to Amersham in 1973 becoming part of Amersham and Wycombe College. In 1927 land was rented from
Lord Carrington
to become the school's playing fields - until then the boys had used the Rye for sports fixtures.
[7]
The boys had to change in an open fronted pavilion - close to where the present one is located - and the girls had to change behind the large roller. The school motto
Quit Ye Like Men
, adapted from I
Corinthians
16 v13, was adopted in 1924. It remained the motto even during the co-ed period - girls were admitted in 1925 mainly to study commercial subjects.
Following the introduction of the
Education Act 1944
, the Institute became the town's new technical school taking children at 11 and 13 plus. In 1946 it was decided to split the school and college although both still operated in the same building. By 1954, the combined school and further education centre had become vastly over-subscribed and unwieldy. Consequently, the High Wycombe College of Further Education was set up on its present site (now
Bucks New University
) although the final separation of pupils did not come about until 1963. In 1956 the girls transferred to the old
Wycombe High School
buildings in Benjamin Road to form
Lady Verney High School
. Lady Verney High School then moved to Wellsborne before finally merging with
Wycombe High School
.

Carved set of 12 lockers, saved from a bonfire.
The boys remained at Easton Street as Wycombe Technical High School for a further 10 years before moving to the present site, the school playing fields at the top of Marlow Hill in 1966. Most of the valuable historic reminders of the early days of the Technical Institute ended up on a bonfire in the massive clearing out operation when the school moved to Marlow Hill. The only exceptions to this were the headmaster's chair, the headmaster's table, engraved with the school motto, and a carved set of 12 lockers. The lockers were designed in 1919 by Mr Shaw Wilson, head of the wood carving department and created by wounded soldiers who had returned from the war. Inscribed on the cornice are the words "They counted not their lives dear unto themselves."

The school in 2008, before the addition of the sixth form block in 2013.
The name was changed to John Hampden School in 1970 and John Hampden Grammar School in 1984. More recent developments gave the school a new façade in September 1995 and the following January work was completed on a sixth-form block to provide specialist teaching rooms, private study rooms, a common room and a new library. In 2002, funding from the
Wolfson Foundation
allowed a new language teaching facility and science laboratory to be opened.
[9]
In 2006 a new classroom block, used mainly for mathematics teaching, and a sports hall were opened by former
Arsenal
goalkeeper
Bob Wilson
.
[10]
This in turn allowed for an extension of the music department and development of a music studio.
On 4 November 2010, a gas explosion occurred in the caretaker's house on the premises. In the incident, the school's caretaker was airlifted to hospital with serious burns and the school evacuated.
[11]
After the explosion the school raised money for the caretaker in his recovery by means of a
Mufti Day
where pupils came to school in their own clothes as opposed to the standard uniform.

Also in 2011, a food technology room was opened, following a successful planning application the previous year.
[15]
A proposal was made to relocate a
Synthetic Turf Pitch
, which was at the time located at the Handy Cross
leisure centre
, to the JHGS site as part of a wider redevelopment of the leisure centre.
[16]
Construction work was underway as of October 2013,
[17]
and was in use by late January 2014.
[18]
In 2013, an extension to the Sixth Form block incorporating a new library was built.
[

In May 2019, a planning application was submitted for the construction of a new three storey classroom block on the front of the site.
[19]
The project was initially announced in December 2018, when the school received around £3m of funding from the Department for Education's selective school expansion fund, which proved controversial.

The new building, named the "Innovation Hub", was opened in October 2021 by football executives

Headteachers
[
edit
]
A plaque inside the school details the leadership since 1893.
There have only been six headteachers in the history of the school.
[23]
The management of the original schools was vested in the trustees who in turn entrusted day-to-day control to art masters Henry Bayfield and Shaw Wilson and the Education Committee secretary WT Pycraft. The secretary was replaced by Hamilton Haddow and in 1913 by Arthur Gardham. W. J. Stamps took over from Bayfield in 1911 and he ultimately became Headmaster of the School of Art. The first headmaster (known in 1920 as Principal) of the Technical School was Arthur Gardham who joined in 1913 and won the
MC
with the
Royal Garrison Artillery
during the
First World War
. The former army captain is remembered by old boys as a determined character who liked to get his own way. As a result of his wartime injuries he always carried a walking stick. He would hold a daily roll call on the Fives Court when he inspected hair, shoes and general tidiness.
[24]
After the sudden death in post of Gardham at the age of 51, the governors appointed William John Davies (1893-1977). Davies was an ex-army captain who had taught at Greenwich Royal Hospital School, Dame Allan's School and Acton Technical College, where he was senior physics lecturer. As the split between the School and College started in 1946, Davies was both principal of the college and headmaster of the school. When Davies was due to retire his job was split; the college job going to Desmond Everett (in 1960) and Harold Ward becoming headmaster (in 1958). He retired in 1982 and was replaced by Andrew MacTavish. MacTavish then retired in July 2000 and was replaced by Stephen Nokes. Nokes retired after 16 years in service in July 2016, replaced by Tracey Hartley in September 2016, the school's first female headteacher.

The
Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute
(also
SWF Institute
, or simply
SWFI
) is an American corporation analyzing public asset owners such as
sovereign wealth funds
and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds. It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute sells its subscription and API/datafeed services as a
financial data vendor
but provides information to the media as well.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Incorporated in 2008, it was founded by
Michael Maduell
and shortly he brought in Carl Linaburg,
[4]
who then left the organization in 2017. In late 2022, Lakshmi Narayanan of the Patel Family Office was named Chairman of SWFI.
[5]
SWFI sells its research and data via subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities. The SWFI Subscription product is located at
.
In 2020, SWFI started to initiate coverage over
family office
sector and wealth management firms.
Transparency ratings
[
edit
]
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.
[6]
[7]
Data
[
edit
]
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds, pensions, asset owners, and other entities. The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.
[8]
SWFI tracks the assets of the following types but not limited:
sovereign wealth fund
pension
endowment
family office
wealth manager
financial holding company
foundation
central bank
bank
venture capital
asset manager
other entities
Norway's sovereign wealth fund crossed $1 trillion in assets in 2017.

]
Among the indigenous populations of Bolivia, it is sometimes called
achuma
or
wachuma
, although these names are also applied to related species such as
Trichocereus macrogonus
which are also used for their
psychedelic
effects.
[3]
Description
[
edit
]
The plant has a light greenish to bluish color grows shrubby to tree-shaped somewhat branching and usually has four to eight ribs. It can grow 2-5 metres (6.6-16.4 ft) tall with stems of up to 15-20 centimetres (5.9-7.9 in) in diameter. The areoles on them are large and are 1.5 to 3 centimeters apart. The two to six spines that emerge from them are unequal. Spines can range in coloration from honey-coloured to brown. These spines can grow up to 0.1-7 cm in length and in fully grown plants are spaced evenly on the ribs, 2.5 to 3 cm apart.
[4]
[5]
The long, funnel-shaped, 15 to 18 cm long white fragrant flowers open at night. They are 16 to 20  centimeters long. The spherical fruits are hairy and are 4 to 6 centimeters long.
Distribution
[
edit
]
The plant comes from departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Tarija and Chuquisaca Bolivia at altitudes of 1000 to 3300 meters. Among the native populations of Bolivia it is sometimes called achuma or wachuma, although these names are also applied to related species, such as Echinopsis pachanoi, which also have hallucinogenic effects.
This does not occur in places where it is the dominant species, such as in the area of La Paz, Bolivia.
Cultivars
[
edit
]
Several varieties of this species are highly prized by ornamental cactus collectors. These include a
cristate
variety, two variants of
monstrose
growth, and a more recently developed clone that exhibits both monstrose and cristate growth.
[6]
These all tend to be much slower growing than the standard form of the species, but owing to their highly unusual shapes, they are sought after by cactus collectors.
The
monstrose
form of
Echinopsis lageniformis
is known as the
penis plant
or
penis cactus
. Contrary to the typical columnar habit of the species, this
cultivar
displays short stem sections that branch avidly, forming a low spiny bush. The upper part of each stem segment is smooth and spineless, resembling a
penis
. The lower part is
spiny
and shows a tendency to form ribs. The plant is light green.  The
German
name for this cultivar,
Frauenglück,
more
euphemistic
than its
English
equivalent, translates as "women's joy".
Psychoactivity
[
edit
]
Main article:
Legality of mescaline cactus by country
Like other species related to it, it has an ancient shamanic use in its place of origin. The plant contains a number of
psychoactive
alkaloids
, in particular the well-studied chemical
mescaline
, typically at levels more consistent than
Echinopsis pachanoi
but lower than some particularly potent
Echinopsis pachanoi
specimens. A level of 0.56% mescaline content by dry weight was reported for
E. lageniformis
, while up to 4.7% for
E. pachanoi.
[7]
The concentrations for specimens from various locations vary considerably and
E. lageniformis
may sometimes contain higher mescaline content than
E. pachanoi

Chemical analysis of some variants of this species have shown it may include some of the most potent of the psychedelic
Trichocereus
species,
[3]
although this is not conclusive nor does it apply to all strains of the species. Outside of its native habitat, it is one of the lesser known and used of the
Trichocereus
cacti for either its psychoactive or ornamental uses. This is not true in areas where it is the dominant species, for example, the
La Paz
area of
Bolivia
.
As with related species, it seems to have long
shamanic
tradition of use throughout its native habitat.

History
[

Early UCLA basketball (1919-1948)
[
edit
]
In 1919,
Fred Cozens
became the first head coach of the UCLA basketball and football teams. Cozens coached the basketball team for two seasons, finishing with an overall record of 21-4.
Caddy Works
was the head coach of the Bruins from 1921 to 1939, guiding them to a 173-159 record. Works was a lawyer by profession and coached the team only during the evenings. According to UCLA player and future Olympian
Frank Lubin
, Works was "more of an honorary coach" with little basketball knowledge.
[8]
Dick Linthicum
was UCLA's first
All-American
in any sport, earning selections in
1931
and
1932
.
[9]
Wilbur Johns
was the UCLA basketball head coach from 1939 to 1948, guiding the Bruins to a 93-120 record.
The John Wooden era (1948-1975)
[
edit
]
John Wooden
coached UCLA to 10 national championships.
From 1948 to 1975,
John Wooden
, nicknamed the "Wizard of
Westwood
", served as UCLA's head coach. He won ten
NCAA
national championships in a 12-year period, including a run of seven in a row that shattered the previous record of only two consecutive titles; to this day, no other team has won more than two straight titles.
[10]
[11]
Within this period, his teams won a men's basketball-record 88 consecutive games.
Prior to Wooden's arrival, UCLA had only won two conference championships in the previous 18 years. In his first season, Wooden guided a UCLA team that had finished with a 12-13 record the previous year to a 22-7 record—then the most wins in a season in program history—and the
Pacific Coast Conference
(PCC) Southern Division championship.
[11]
[12]
In his second season, Wooden led the Bruins to a 24-7 record and the PCC championship. The Bruins would win the division title in each of the next two seasons and the conference title in the latter season. Up to that time, UCLA had won only two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and it had not won a conference title of any kind since winning the
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
in 1927.
In 1955-56, Wooden guided the Bruins to their first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that only came to an end in the 1956 NCAA Tournament at the hands of a
University of San Francisco
team that featured
Bill Russell
. However, UCLA was unable to maintain this level of performance over the immediate ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament as the
Pete Newell
-coached
California
teams took control of the conference at the end of the decade. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation imposed on all UCLA sports in the aftermath of a
scandal
involving illegal payments made to players on the school's football team, along with USC, Cal and Stanford, resulting in the dismantling of the PCC conference.
[13]
Lew Alcindor (later
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
) makes a reverse two hand
dunk
.
By 1962 the probation was no longer in place and  Wooden had returned the Bruins to the top of their conference (now the
Pac-12 Conference
). This time, however, they would take the next step, and go on to unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college sports. A narrow loss due largely to a controversial foul call in the semifinal of the 1962 NCAA Tournament convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships.
[13]
Two seasons later, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach
Jerry Norman
persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press defense.
[13]
The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team led by
Walt Hazzard
and
Gail Goodrich
that went undefeated on its way to the school's first basketball national championship.
Wooden's team repeated as national champions the following season before the squad fell briefly in 1966 when it finished second in the conference to
Oregon State
. UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference champions went to the tournament. However, the Bruins' incarnation returned with a vengeance in 1967 with the arrival of sophomore All-America and MVP
Lew Alcindor
. The team reclaimed not only the conference title but the national crown with an undefeated season.
In January 1968, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the
Astrodome
in
Houston
, where Alcindor squared off against
Elvin Hayes
in the
Game of the Century
, which was the nation's first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71-69 behind Hayes' 39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden stated, "We have to start over." They did, and went undefeated the rest of the year, avenging Houston 101-69 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. Hayes, who had been averaging 37.7 points per game, was held to only 10 points. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained the Houston center.

The emergence of the Bruins under Wooden vastly increased the program's popularity.  Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the
Men's Gym
.  It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal.  This forced games to be moved to
Pan Pacific Auditorium
, the
Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena
and other venues around Los Angeles when larger crowds were expected—an increasing inconvenience since the Bruins' first national title.  At Wooden's urging, a much larger on-campus facility was built in time for the 1965-66 season, the nearly 13,000 seat
Pauley Pavilion
, .
Wooden coached his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, when UCLA trounced
Stanford
93-59. Four weeks later, following a 75-74 overtime victory over
Louisville
in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the
championship game
.
[16]
His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly, as his team responded with a win over
Kentucky
to claim Wooden's first career coaching victory over the Wildcats and his unprecedented 10th national championship in a twelve-year span.
During his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the "Wizard of
Westwood
", although he personally disdained the nickname. He gained lasting fame at UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, which included seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.
[10]
His UCLA teams also had a then-record winning streak of 88 games
[17]
[18]
and four perfect 30-0 seasons.
[10]
They also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments
[10]
and 98 straight home game wins at
Pauley Pavilion
. Wooden was named NCAA College Basketball's "Coach of the Year" in 1964, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. In 1967, he was named the
Henry Iba Award
USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1972, he shared
Sports Illustrated
magazine's "
Sportsman of the Year
" award with
Billie Jean King
. He was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973,
[19]
becoming the first to be honored as both a player and a coach.
[11]
Post-Wooden era (1975-1988)
[
edit
]
From 1975 to 1977,
Gene Bartow
served as the head coach of
UCLA
.  He guided them to a 52-9 record, including a berth in the 1976
Final Four
. He coached the 1977 College Player of the Year,
Marques Johnson
.
Gary Cunningham
became the head coach at UCLA in 1977. He coached two seasons, winning the Pacific-8 and Pacific-10 conference championships and leading UCLA to a #2 ranking in the final polls both seasons.

Larry Brown
then moved on to coach UCLA from 1979 to 1981, leading his freshman-dominated 1979-80 team to the NCAA title game before falling to
Louisville
, 59-54.  However, that runner-up finish was later vacated by the NCAA after two players were found to be ineligible. This was one of the few times a Final Four squad had its record vacated (Villanova had its runner-up finish vacated in 1971 because
Howard Porter
had signed a pro contract).
[20]
Larry Farmer
was the head coach of UCLA from 1981 to 1984, guiding them to a 61-23 (.726) record. He had recruited
Earvin "Magic" Johnson
to come play at UCLA, but then told Johnson (was drafted into the NBA in 1979) to hold off on a visit as he was more interested in
Albert King
.
[21]
Farmer signed neither King nor Johnson, and neither recruit played for UCLA.
In 1984,
Walt Hazzard
was named the UCLA  basketball coach 20 years after he was an All-America when UCLA won its first national championship. He coached for four seasons, winning 77 out of 125 games. The 1984-1985 UCLA Bruin basketball team won the
NIT
championship. The 1986-1987 UCLA Bruin basketball team won both the
Pac-10
regular season championship as well as the inaugural
Pacific-10 Conference men's basketball tournament
.
The Jim Harrick era (1988-1996)
[
edit
]
In 1988,
Jim Harrick
returned to UCLA (he had spent two years as an assistant coach from 1978 to 1979) to assume head coaching duties after the firing of
Walt Hazzard
. During the recruiting period before his first season, he recruited
Don MacLean
, the most significant recruit to commit to UCLA in several years. McLean's arrival helped start a revival of the basketball program. Within four years, the Bruins were in the Elite Eight--"officially" their deepest advance in the tournament in 13 years, and only the second time they had gone that far since Wooden's departure.
During the
1994-1995 season
, he led UCLA to a 32-1 record (a loss to California  was subsequently forfeited to the Bruins) and the school's
eleventh national championship
, its first since the
1974-75 season
.  The 31 actual  wins would stand as a school record until the 2005-06 season. In 1996, Harrick's Bruins were upset in the first round by
Princeton
. Shortly before the 1997 season, UCLA fired Harrick for lying about who attended a recruiting dinner. At the time, Harrick was the second-winningest coach in school history and the only coach to achieve a National Championship at UCLA post John Wooden to date.
The Steve Lavin era (1996-2003)
[
edit
]
After the sacking of Harrick and with the departure of assistants
Mark Gottfried
and
Lorenzo Romar
for head coaching jobs shortly after the 1995 NCAA Championship season,
Steve Lavin
, as the assistant with the longest tenure at UCLA, was selected as interim head coach.
Later that season on February 11, 1997, with the Bruins tied for first place in the Pac-10 with an 8-3 record, UCLA removed the "interim" tag from Lavin's title and formally named him as its 11th head coach. The Bruins then won their next 11 games en route to the Pac-10 title, before being eliminated by the
Minnesota Gophers
in the NCAA Midwest Regional Final. In seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12-4 in games involving overtime. Additionally Lavin's Bruins had a 10-4 record against the rival
USC Trojans
. During the period 1997-2002, Lavin's Bruins compiled nine consecutive overtime victories. These included victories over
Arizona
,
Cincinnati
(2002 NCAA second round double overtime victory over No. 1 West Region seed),
Kentucky
, and
Stanford
(then ranked No 1). The Stanford win was sealed by a last second jumper by star sophomore guard
JaRon Rush
.
At UCLA from 1996 to 2003, Lavin compiled a record of 145-78.  As both an assistant and head coach, Lavin participated in 13 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (1990-2002), while working at Purdue and UCLA. During Lavin's tenure as a head coach, he was one of only two coaches in the country to lead his team to five NCAA "Sweet 16s" in six years (1997, 1998, 2000-2002), the other coach being
Duke's
Mike Krzyzewski
. Lavin guided UCLA to six consecutive seasons of 20 or more wins, as well as six consecutive NCAA tournament appearances.
[22]
Lavin signed seven McDonald's High School All-Americans.  Seven of Lavin's former Bruin recruits became roster members of NBA teams:
Trevor Ariza
,
Matt Barnes
,
Baron Davis
,
Dan Gadzuric
,
Ryan Hollins
,
Jason Kapono
, and
Earl Watson
.
During Lavin's tenure as head coach, the Bruins qualified for six consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1997-2002). Lavin's record in the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament is 10-1.  His winning percentage (90.9%) in the first two rounds is second only to Dean Smith in NCAA Tournament history. However, Lavin also coached the Bruins to their only loss in an NCAA tournament game played in the State of California (a 2002 loss to Missouri in San Jose).
In seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12-4 in games involving overtime. The Bruins defeated the No. 1 team in the country in four consecutive collegiate seasons: Stanford in 2000 and 2001, Kansas in 2002 and Arizona in 2003.
In March 2003, following UCLA's first losing season (10-19) in 55 years, Lavin was fired.
Despite some success under the watch of Steve Lavin, the program wanted to regain its position in the college basketball upper echelon. Even the success in the NCAA tournament belied the fact that UCLA had earned no better than a number 4 seed with the exception of the 1997 season.  The
2002-03
season turned out to be the back-breaker for Lavin as the Bruins stumbled to a 10-19 record and a 6-12 record in the conference.  It was the first losing season for UCLA in over five decades.  Lavin was dismissed following the season.
Ben Howland era (2003-2013)
[
edit
]

Kevin Love

USC
UCLA looked to find a coach that could move the Bruins back to the elite ranks of the Pac-10 and the country.
Ben Howland
's success at the University of Pittsburgh and his southern California roots made him an attractive candidate.  In 2003, he left Pitt and accepted the head coaching duties at UCLA.
[23]
Howland remedied this disappointment in his recruiting efforts.  Howland produced a top tier recruiting class from athletes in southern California that fit his Big East style.  Behind Lavin hold-over Dijon Thompson and Howland recruits
Jordan Farmar
and
Arron Afflalo
, UCLA produced a winning season for the first time in three years and returned to the tournament, where they lost in the first round.
Starting the
2005-06 season
with the majority of the roster made over in Howland's image and with the Lavin hold-overs (e.g.,
Ryan Hollins
and
Cedric Bozeman
), the Bruins produced an excellent campaign.  They finished the regular season 24-6, winning the Pac-10 Conference title. They then roared through the
Pac-10 tournament
, winning each game by double digits en route to only the second Pac-10 tournament championship in school history.  The momentum continued into the NCAA tournament as the second-seeded Bruins defeated
Gonzaga
in the Sweet Sixteen.  They then upset top-seeded Memphis to reach the school's first Final Four in 11 years. The run ended in the championship game against
Florida
, whose imposing front-line proved to be a matchup problem for the Bruins.
Howland continued his success at UCLA the following year. The
Bruins
finished undefeated at home for the first time in 22 years, winning the Pac-10 conference title. However they lost in their first
Pac-10 tournament game
and were seeded second in the NCAA Tournament West Region. After a close second-round win over
Indiana
, Howland led the Bruins to a win over his former team,
Pitt
in the Sweet Sixteen. The Bruins then again upset the top seed in the West Region,
Kansas
, and reached the second of UCLA's first consecutive Final Fours since the
John Wooden
era, only to lose again to
Florida
in the national semifinal.
At the start of the
2007-08 season
, expectations for
UCLA
were the highest ever with the arrival of
Kevin Love
, one of the best low-post prospects in the high school class of 2007.
[24]
Combined with the emergence of
Russell Westbrook
and
Darren Collison
in the back-court, the Bruins won their 3rd consecutive Pac-10 conference title, and their second
Pac-10 tournament title
in three years. They received their first No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament since 1995, and once again reached the Final Four, where they faced another top seed, the
Memphis Tigers
. Memphis got the better of the Bruins, who returned to Westwood without a championship once again.
However, the Bruins program under Howland began to struggle in subsequent seasons. After 2008, UCLA did not advance past the first weekend of the NCAA tourney, and did not qualify for the tournament in
2010
and
2012
.
[25]
With a 77-73 victory over
Penn
on December 10, 2011; Howland passed
Jim Harrick
for second on UCLA's all-time wins list behind
John Wooden
. Nonetheless, questions about how Howland was running the program began to come into focus. In February 2012, a
Sports Illustrated
article portrayed UCLA player
Reeves Nelson
as a bully on and off the court, who at times intentionally tried to injure his teammates. According to the article, Howland looked the other way and did not discipline Nelson for over two years.
[26]
[27]
From 2008—the Bruins' last Final Four appearance—through 2012, at least 11 players left the UCLA program.
[28]
Although the 2012-2013 Bruins won the Pac-12 regular season championship, they quickly bowed out in the first round of the NCAA tournament. On March 25, 2013, three days after being eliminated by 11th seed Minnesota, UCLA fired Howland.
[29]
[30]
Steve Alford era (2013-2019)
[
edit
]
On March 30, 2013,
Steve Alford
signed a seven-year, $18.2-million contract to become the head coach of UCLA, replacing the fired Ben Howland.
[31]
In his first year as head coach Alford led UCLA to a Pac-12 tournament championship, a feat not accomplished since 2008. The team later went on to the Sweet Sixteen of the
NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament
as a 4 seed in the South regional before losing to the 1 seed Florida.
In his second year, the team was controversially chosen to participate in the
2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament
as an 11 seed in the South Region, where they upset the 6 seed
SMU
on a game-winning goaltending call. The Bruins went on to defeat the
University of Alabama at Birmingham Blazers
before losing to
Gonzaga
in the Sweet Sixteen.
After a disappointing third season in which UCLA suffered their fourth losing record since 1948, the team rebounded in the following season, going 31-5 before falling to
Kentucky
, again in the Sweet Sixteen, considered an underachievement given the talent level and overall record of the team. Freshman point guard
Lonzo Ball
, as well as the program in general, garnered national media attention for the outspoken behavior of his father
LaVar Ball
.
[32]
[33]
[34]
Prior to the beginning of the
2017-18 season
, the team travelled to China to participate in the annual Pac-12 China Game. On November 6 in
Hangzhou
, during a block of free time allotted to the players, freshmen
LiAngelo Ball
,
Cody Riley
and Jalen Hill shoplifted sunglasses from a
Louis Vuitton
department store. They were placed under house arrest by local police the next day and required to hand over their passports.
[35]
The controversy garnered immense attention due to the reputation of LiAngelo as a member of the
Ball family
and received significant media coverage. President
Donald Trump
, who was concurrently visiting China, reportedly asked General Secretary
Xi Jinping
to pardon the three men, and they were released back to the United States shortly after, although Ball's family questioned if the President's request was a direct reason for the release.
[36]
Xi himself later reportedly denied that Trump had asked him about pardoning the UCLA players and that the General Secretary had nothing to do with their release. The players were placed on suspension from basketball activities, and were eventually suspended for the entirety of the season on December 22.
[37]
LaVar Ball maintained that his son had not deserved suspension; LiAngelo Ball withdrew from UCLA and signed with a
sports agent
, making him ineligible for further NCAA competition.
[38]
UCLA finished the regular season in a three-way tie for third (tied with Utah and Stanford) in the Pac-12 (21-10, 11-7), disappointingly falling to St. Bonaventure in the NCAA First Four Play-in Round.  Junior  guard
Aaron Holiday
was named to the First-team
All-Pac-12
and the Pac-12 All Defensive Team, the first player to do so in the Alford era.
[39]
Holiday was drafted 23 by the Indiana Pacers in the First Round of the 2018 NBA Draft.
UCLA started the
2018-19 season
ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll and won seven of its first nine games. However, they concluded non-conference play with four consecutive losses, including back-to-back home losses to
mid-major
teams
Belmont
and
Liberty
. The 73-58 loss to Liberty on December 29 was UCLA's most lopsided home loss in Alford's tenure. Two days after that loss, UCLA announced that Alford had been
fired
and that assistant coach
Murry Bartow
would serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.
[40]
They failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, and ended the decade without a Final Four appearance for the first time since the 1950s.
[41]
Mick Cronin era (2019-present)
[
edit
]
On April 9, 2019, UCLA announced the hiring of
Mick Cronin
as the program's 14th head coach.
[42]
He was named
Pac-12 Coach of the Year
in his first season in
2019-20
.
[43]
However, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
, the Pac-12 Tournament and NCAA Tournament were cancelled.
[44]
The following season in
2020-21
, the Bruins opened  the NCAA Tournament in the First Four, advancing to the Final Four after defeating No. 1 seed
Michigan
. No. 11 seed UCLA became the second First Four team to reach the Final Four, the school's first national semifinal since
2008
,
[45]
which had also been their last trip to the Elite Eight.
[46]
In
2022-23
, the Bruins received a No. 2 seed in the
2023 NCAA tournament
, their highest seeding since they were placed No. 1 in
2008
.
[47]
They advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the third straight season,
[48]
but they were eliminated from the tournament for the second time in three years by Gonzaga.

UCLA Bruins
vs.
Oregon State Beavers
, January 2013, in the "New Pauley Pavilion"
Following UCLA's second championship in 1965, the idea of constructing a new arena to accommodate increased interest in the team was proposed. In 1965,
Pauley Pavilion
, named for oil magnate Ed Pauley, was built on campus and has been the home of the Bruins basketball programs since that time. During the 2011-12 season, Pauley Pavilion underwent a complete, $136 million renovation, both inside and out, earning it the nickname of "New Pauley."
[50]
A new attendance record was set on March 2, 2013, when 13,727 fans watched the Bruins defeating the Arizona Wildcats 74-69.
Mo Ostin Basketball Center
[
edit
]
The Mo Ostin Basketball Center  south of the Los Angeles Tennis Center and close to Pauley Pavilion, the basketball team's home court was completed in 2017 to serve as a practice facility and hub for the basketball team. On December 14, 2015,
Russell Westbrook
had donated a "significant" sum to the construction of the center, for which the facility's court was named in his honor.
[51]
Westbrook's former teammate,
Kevin Love
, matched his contribution on September 20, 2016, for which the strength and conditioning center was named after him.

When
John Wooden
became the coach, UCLA turned into a national basketball powerhouse. UCLA has won 11
NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments
and has dominated the conference, winning two games for every one that USC won. As of the 2013-2014 season, UCLA has won or shared the conference title 31 times, and USC has won or shared the title 7 times.

Since the mid-1980s, UCLA has also had a basketball rivalry with
Arizona
under coach
Lute Olson
, as the two schools competed for the Pac-10 Championship every year. Since 1985 the two teams have combined to win 21 out of the 29 conference titles. The UCLA-Arizona basketball rivalry still is seen as the match up of the two premier teams in the conference. Also, the performance of the two schools influences the national opinion of the conference.

Notre Dame
[

See also:
Notre Dame-UCLA rivalry
UCLA had a basketball rivalry with
Notre Dame
that started when
Digger Phelps
was the Notre Dame coach and
John Wooden
was the UCLA coach. UCLA and Notre Dame played a home-and-home meeting for several seasons, which is otherwise uncommon outside conference play. This rivalry existed from the desire of the Notre Dame athletic department to schedule the top schools for intersectional competition. UCLA and Notre Dame played 42 times between 1966 and 1995, and the height of the rivalry was when Notre Dame ended UCLA's consecutive-game winning streak at 88 on January 19, 1974. UCLA also broke a 60-game Notre Dame winning streak in South Bend. Previous UCLA head coach
Ben Howland
scheduled Notre Dame four times: in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2009.
[59]
After Notre Dame's victory on December 14, 2019, UCLA leads the all-time series 29-21.

The
FGP 227
was a scale flying model of the
Blohm & Voss BV 238
flying boat
, built to provide data for the development of the BV 238.
[1]
Design and development
[
edit
]
The proposed
Blohm & Voss BV 238
flying boat was to have an advanced hull design which had never been tried before. The Czech Flugtechnische Fertigungsgemeinschaft Prag (FGP) was engaged to build a quarter-scale test aircraft.
[2]
The FGP 227 was a faithful, approximately quarter-scale model of the proposed design, having a long, narrow hull with a high-mounted wing and conventional tail. The pilot sat in a front cockpit and the flight test observer in another one aft of the wing. Power was supplied by six 15.7 kW (21 hp)
ILO F 12/400
air-cooled two-stroke engines driving three bladed propellers, mounted along the wings.
[1]
The model was completed early in 1944, registered as BQ+UZ and fitted with a temporary wheeled undercarriage of ten small wheels fitted with low-pressure tyres.
Operational history
[
edit
]
Intended to allow flight tests to commence from the manufacturers airfield, the FGP 227 refused to take-off from the grass airfield. The aircraft was dismantled and transported to
Erprobungsstelle See
,
Travemünde
(E-Stelle - flying boat testing station).
[3]
During transport French prisoners of war loading the wing onto flat-bed trucks allowed it to fall from a crane causing damage which was not repaired until September 1944.
[1]
Flight tests commenced in September 1944 as soon as the repairs were completed, but all six engines stopped due to fuel starvation soon after take-off, resulting in a heavy landing on the water. The FGP 227 was again repaired after which the aircraft flew several more times. By this time construction and testing of the BV 238 had started, so no useful data was gleaned from the programme.

The ZAMHP occupies approximately 60 hectares
[9]
[10]
across its three sectors, although most visits focus on the only restored structure, known as the
Palacio
[8]
[11]
(Sector 1).
It was declared a Cultural Heritage of the Nation on October 10, 2000, through National Directorial Resolution No. 1189 issued by the then National Institute of Culture, now the
Ministry of Culture
.
[7]
Description
[
edit
]
Before the
Spanish conquest
, Huaycán de Pariachi was one of the main administrative centers of the middle Rímac valley. During the Late Intermediate Period (900 - 1450 AD) the
Ichma
[12]
had a very important local presence, which lasted until the
Late Horizon
(1450 - 1532 AD), when the
Incas
[9]
arrived on the central coast and assimilated them.
Huaycán de Pariachi is divided into three sectors.
[13]
[8]
[6]
Sector 1
[
edit
]
Remains of walls
A
huanca
(monolith) in Huaycán de Pariachi
Sector 1 is the largest and consists of the remains of an ancient population or
llaqta
(
Pariacha,
according to the
Huarochirí Manuscript
). This sector has two zones: spaces used as residences for the elite (
Palaces
;
[13]
[8]
[6]
one of them restored) and spaces used for other purposes (domestic, industrial, and ritual).
Architecturally, the restored
Palacio
is constructed using two techniques: rammed earth walls and stone and mud walls. It includes numerous spaces such as courtyards, open areas with benches, ramps, niches (not to be confused with niches carved into some walls, as some of them were used for funerary purposes during the colonial and republican eras), as well as numerous
collqas
[14]
[1]
[5]
(deep circular storage deposits, some shaped like a bottle) used for storing food.
Sector 2
[
edit
]
In Sector 2 (in front of the main entrance), a segment of an elevated walled road can be observed. This road was part of the network that formed the
Qhapaq Ñan
[15]
[16]
during the Late Horizon. It connected
Pariacha
with other administrative centers in the valley, such as San Juan de Pariachi,
Huanchihuaylas
(now Santa Clara),
Mama
(now Ricardo Palma), and, through the Molle ravine pass, with
Huaycán de Cieneguilla
and the main Qhapaq Ñan road from Hatun Xauxa to
Pachacamac
in the Lurín Valley.
Sector 3
[
edit
]
Sector 3 is separated from the previous two sectors and is located 1 km west of the entrance to Sector 1. It covers an area of 18 hectares within a perimeter of 553 m, adjacent to the Horacio Zevallos Housing Development. It presents structures with rammed earth walls, although they are in poor condition.
Restoration and investigations
[
edit
]
Huaycán de Pariachi has not been fully investigated. However, numerous archaeologists have visited the site, including Dr.
Julio C. Tello
in the 1940s.
[17]
Arturo Jiménez Borja
carried out restoration and conservation work in the 1970s.
[18]
Archaeological explorations requested by the city of Huaycán before the
INC
in 1985, helped to delimit its intangible area. In 2015, the Archaeological Research Project of the
Ministry of Culture of Peru
was carried out.

Office
Headquarters
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Parent agency
Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement
Website
The
National Mine Map
Repository
(
NMMR
)
[1]
is part of the
United States Department of the Interior
(DOI), Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE or OSM).
[2]
The NMMR resides in the
Pittsburgh
suburb of
Green Tree
,
Pennsylvania
, and collects and maintains mine map information and images for the entire country, including data and maps of
coal
mines in the
anthracite
coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania.
[3]
The Green Tree facility provides and stores, digitally and in
microfilm
(aperture cards),
[4]
over 182,000 maps of abandoned mines.  This repository contains maps of mine workings from the 1790s to the present day.
[5]
It serves as a point of reference for mine maps and other information for both surface and underground mines throughout the United States. It also serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency. The NMMR provides services ranging from retrieving mine related data for economic analysis to assessing the potential risk associated with underground mining. Through analysis of mine maps and related information, the repository assists private and public sectors in industrial and commercial development, highway construction,
[6]
and the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare. In addition, they collect, reproduce, and maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation for private and public interests.
History
[
edit
]
The
Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969
established a national mine map repository.
[7]
The repository was funded by and assigned to the Department of the Interior,
Bureau of Mines
(BOM) in 1970. A repository was set up at a BOM office in Pittsburgh and
Wilkes-Barre
,
[8]
Pennsylvania and covered all states east of the
Mississippi River
with the exception of
Louisiana
and
Minnesota
. These two states, together with
Arizona
,
New Mexico
,
North Dakota
,
South Dakota
,
Wyoming
,
Utah
, Colorado,
Missouri
, and
Kansas
, were covered by a separate repository at the BOM Intermountain Field Operation Center in
Denver
,
Colorado
. A fourth repository, in Spokane, Washington, held the mining archives for the western states of
Washington
,
Oregon
,
California
,
Nevada
,
Montana
, and
Idaho
.
In 1982 the responsibility of maintaining the repository and its staff was formally transferred to DOI's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Later, when BOM was dissolved in 1996, all of the maps from the BOM offices were consolidated into the current OSMRE Pittsburgh repository.  The Wilkes-Barre repository was closed in 2011,
[9]
and its collection transferred to the Pittsburgh office,
[10]
which is designated as the National Mine Map Repository.
The mission of the repository has always been to obtain authoritative maps on past and current mining operations and preserve them on microfilm. Higher priority is given to maps of mines in areas where the potential for adverse impact to the environment is more significant. The NMMR, in addition to being an archival entity concerned with the preservation of mine maps, is also a basic reference file of information on mines.  The information is made available to federal and state geological surveys, state mining bureaus, mining companies, oil and gas companies, conservationists, research and planning organizations, water pollution boards, city and industrial planners, highway engineers, building contractors, real estate developers and private citizens.
Today the NMMR facility is equipped with modern map scanning and archiving capability to digitize maps.  The primary archival method remains microfilm although the repository's holdings are increasingly available in digital format.
Available information
[
edit
]
NMMR's oldest mine: 1792 anthracite coal, "Old Mine."
One of NMMR's oldest mine maps: 1859 anthracite coal map from Hazleton Coal Co.
The NMMR contains digital and microfilm maps of surface and underground coal, metal, and non-metal mines throughout the United States. Some of the information that can be obtained from the repository includes:
Mine and company names
Underground mine plans
Mains, rooms, and
pillars
Man-ways,
shafts
,
mine surface openings
, barrier pillars and ventilation facilities
Closure (final) maps

, surface facilities, roads, ponds, streams, and property survey points
Districts,
townships, sections, ranges
, counties and municipalities, latitudes and longitudes, elevation bench marks, and surface elevations
Gas well, oil well, and drill hole locations
[11]
Map acquisition and archiving
[
edit
]
The NMMR acquires maps through public outreach directed at state and federal environmental agencies as well as mining companies, engineering and consulting firms, surveying companies, universities, and private citizens. The repository is constantly seeking donations of mine maps to add to the microfilm/digital collection.
[12]
When maps are received from a donor, they are scanned and stored in both microfilm and digital archives. The maps, along with a scanned images (upon request), are returned to the donor. The repository does not retain hard copies of maps.
Procedures
[
edit
]
As maps are obtained at the repository, they are assigned a unique six-digit identification number (document number). Data sheets are prepared for each map giving all available information including: map document number; state; county; mine name; mine ID number (MSHA); company name; mine type; and both the Universal Transverse Mercator (
UTM
) grid zone and the latitude and longitude of the geo-located point on the map. This information is input into the Mine Map Index System. The sorted maps are then scanned into a digital format and stored on the repository's dedicated 500
terabyte
mass storage
array
.
[13]
The NMMR utilizes different types of
scanning equipment
[14]
to facilitate archiving mine maps made available in a variety of media.

Iran-Venezuela Bi-National Bank
(
Persian
:
بانک مشترک ایران و ونزوئلا
,
Bank Mishiterk-e Iran vâ Vânuzuilâ
,
Spanish
:
Banco Binacional Irán-Venezuela
) is an
international financial institution
that was founded in 2010 with an aim to develop commercial ties between
Iran
and
Venezuela
.
[1]
Out of the 40 banks legally licensed to operate in Iran, the Iran-Venezuela Bi-National Bank is one of the only five foreign banks to make that list.
[4]
History
[
edit
]
It started as a
joint venture
between two state-owned banks,
Banco Industrial de Venezuela
and
Export Development Bank of Iran
with a starting capital of $200 million offered equally by both parties.
[2]
In September 2013, the
United States Department of the Treasury
imposed sanction on the bank.
[5]
In 2015, an official in the
Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran
told press that "[the] bank is not given much freedom" and it is being managed one-sidedly by Iran, because the Venezuelan side does not participate in the general assemblies.
[6]
By 2016, the Iranian side was willing to sell its share.
[7]
In 2018, the US reimposed sanctions on the bank.
[8]
In July 2020, Iran officials announced the Iran-Venezuela Bi-National Bank would enter the
Tehran Stock Exchange
by March 2021 (17% to be floated on the stock market).

Alma mater
University of Manchester
Cecil Simon Franks
(1 July 1935 - 2 February 2014) was a British solicitor and politician from
Manchester
. He was the
Member of Parliament
for
Barrow and Furness
from the
1983 General Election
until the
1992 General Election
.
Franks was born in
Salford
and was the son of George Franks, an estate agent and Labour councillor. After
Manchester Grammar School
he took an LL.B. at
Manchester University
, and was admitted as a solicitor in 1958. He went into property, and during the 1960s acted as legal adviser and promoter to a number of pop groups. Franks joined the Labour Party at 17, and in 1959 was its election agent at
Knutsford
. The next year he was elected to Salford council, sitting alongside his father; but in 1964 he was dropped as a candidate, alleging a plot against him by Left-wing members of the engineering union. He appealed to Transport House, and won. Franks joined the Conservatives the following year and was elected as a Tory councillor in 1966, and became leader of the council's Conservative group. After reorganisation in 1974 he sat on Manchester City Council, again leading the Tory group.
[1]
His election as Barrow's MP was somewhat of a surprise, given that he was a
Conservative Party
candidate in a traditional
Labour Party
heartland. In being elected, Franks defeated former cabinet minister
Albert Booth
.
The explanation for this was popular national support of the Conservative party for its support for military actions in the Falklands war.
Barrow-in-Furness
, the constituency's biggest town, is largely dependent on its Royal Navy contracts, and in particular,
nuclear submarines
(at
VSEL
, the area's major employer, even today) which played a leading part in the Falklands conflict. At the 1987 election, the Labour party was still wanting to cancel Trident, this Labour policy was locally unpopular and Franks was able to hold on to this Labour 'safe-seat' for the next 4 years until 1992.
By 1992 the Labour Party was still planning to cancel the last Trident Submarine that was yet to be built, the Conservatives were still pro Trident. However, the electorate were not convinced enough that the loss of employment was sufficient to merit a vote for another Conservative MP. After losing his seat in
Parliament
, he did not stand for election again, and from 1995, involved himself working with various charities in opposing the processing of
Amazon rainforest
wood in
China
.
Franks, aged 78, died at his home near
Altrincham
on 2 February 2014. His first marriage, to Marlene Glick, was dissolved, and an adopted son predeceased him. He is survived by his partner of 24 years, Anne.

just south of
Ash Mountain
, the highest peak of the
Tuya Range
, the Tuya River flows south about 200 km (120 mi)
[5]
to meet the Stikine River in the
Grand Canyon of the Stikine
.
[10]
The Tuya River's main tributary is the
Little Tuya River
. The Tuya River divides the
Tanzilla Plateau
on the east from the
Kawdy Plateau
, to the northwest, and the
Nahlin Plateau
, to the southwest. All three are considered sub-plateaus of the
Stikine Plateau
.
[11]
The Tuya River's watershed covers 3,575 km

(1,380 sq mi),
[6]
and its mean annual
discharge
is estimated at 36.9 m

/s (1,300 cu ft/s).
[6]
The mouth of the Tuya River is located about 24 km (15 mi) northeast of
Telegraph Creek
, British Columbia, about 67 km (42 mi) southwest of
Dease Lake
, British Columbia, and about 210 km (130 mi) east of

Geography
[
edit
]
The Tuya River originates at High Tuya Lake in Tuya Mountains Provincial Park,
[16]
just south of Ash Mountain, the highest peak of the Tuya Range. It flows south to
Tuya Lake
, southeast of
Tuya Butte
[17]
and east of
Mount Josephine
. The tributary Butte Creek,
[18]
flowing south from Butte Lake in Tuya Mountains Provincial Park,
[19]
empties into Tuya Lake. From the southern end of Tuya Lake the Tuya River continues south. It is joined by Josephine Creek
[20]
and numerous unnamed tributaries.
[2]
[21]
Continuing south the Tuya River flows east of Tachilta Lakes,
[22]
collecting more tributaries including Cody Creek,
[23]
Tachilta Creek,
[24]
Mckessock Creek,
[25]
and Ross Creek.
[26]
A few kilometres west of Cariboo Meadows
[27]
the Tuya River is joined by its main tributary, the
Little Tuya River
.
[28]
As the river nears the Stikine River it is joined by
Classy Creek
,
[29]
then flows under
Telegraph Creek Road
. The Tuya River empties into the Stikine River near Days Ranch,
[30]
the mouth of the
Klastline River
,
[31]
and the Tahltan
Indian reserve
of "
Tahltan 10
",
[32]
of the
Tahltan First Nation
,
[33]
[2]
[21]
Geology
[
edit
]
Coal has been found in rocks exposed in the drainage of the Tuya River and its tributaries the
Little Tuya River
and Mansfield Creek, between the communities of
Dease Lake
and
Telegraph Creek
in northwestern BC. This coal field is called the Tuya River Coal Basin. The coal was first discovered in 1904, but the main exploration of its economic potential occurred in the late 1970s to 1990s by
PetroCanada
.
[34]
Natural history
[
edit
]
The Tuya River drainage provides very high quality salmon spawning habitat, but fish passage is blocked by several barriers including an 11 m (36 ft) waterfall located about 3 km (1.9 mi) above the mouth of the Tuya and another significant barrier about 51 km (32 mi) upriver.
[35]
In addition, a 2006 landslide created a barrier to fish passage near the mouth of the Tuya River.
Chinook salmon
spawn in the lowermost portion of the river, below the blockage.
[36]
In the 1950s the Alaska Department of Fish and Game assessed the Tuya River as having the highest level of potential salmon spawning habitat of any transboundary river, possibly capable of supporting more
sockeye salmon
than the entire Stikine River.
[35]
The
Pacific Salmon Commission
, a joint US-Canada transboundary river salmon protection regulatory body, has made the Tuya River a major component of its efforts to improve fish stocks in the Stikine River watershed.
[36]
In 2008 explosives were used to blast through the fish barrier created by the 2006 landslide. Field studies in 2009 indicated that the landslide barrier had been successfully breached.
[36]
Salmonid species found in the Tuya River in 2009 included Chinook salmon, sockeye salmon,
coho salmon
,
pink salmon
,
rainbow trout
, and
bull trout
.

Abeti Masikini: Le Combat d'Une Femme
(English:
Abeti Masikini: The Struggle of A Woman
) is a 2015 Congolese
documentary film
about the
Congolese
Diva and
soukous
star
Abeti Masikini
who fought for
gender equality
in the music industry during the 1970s. The film was directed by
Ne Kunda Nlaba
, who produced and wrote the film with
Laura Kutika
.
[1]
Synopsis
[
edit
]
Before 1970 in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
, singing professionally was taken as a job for men; the industry was dominated by male singers.
Abeti Masikini (Elisabeth Finant), the daughter of the Congolese political figure Jean Pierre Finant assassinated with the first
Prime minister
,
Patrice Emery Lumumba
in 1961, stood up at age 16 and integrated the music industry. She gained success by bringing new melodies, style, and rhythm into the
soukous
genre despite rejections, deceptions, failures and hate for being a woman and for her voice.
[

She was the first African woman to perform at
Bruno Coquatrix
’s
Olympia
in
Paris
in 1973, and then went to some big venues around the world such as
Carnegie Hall
,
Royal Albert Hall
, Wimbledon,
Wembley Arena
, and
Le Zénith
, among other venues.
Written by Laura Kutika, produced and directed by Laura Kutika and
Ne Kunda Nlaba
,
Abeti Masikini: Le Combat d’une Femme
shows the struggle of this woman singer, who had to cope with an artistic career and family life as a mother and later became an international icon, a voice and an example for other African young women in the industry. This documentary film raises the issue about female emancipation and takes us back to the 60's and 70's nostalgic music time.
The documentary film is a co-production between Un Sourire Nouveau and Labson Bizizi-Cine Kongo Ltd, and was premiered in Paris in France on 19 September 2015 and then screened at Festival du Film Africain de Belgique (FIFAB) in
Brussels
on 20 September 2015 and at Afrika Film Festival in March 2016 in Leuven.

Rossdale
is a river valley neighbourhood in the city of
Edmonton
,
Alberta
,
Canada
, located immediately south of the
downtown core
.  It is a popular residential neighbourhood with easy access to downtown, the
University of Alberta
, the Edmonton river valley park system, and other amenities.
A short distance to the west of the neighbourhood, along River Valley Road, are
the Royal Glenora Club
, the Golf Course, and the Skating Oval in
Victoria Park
.
The community is represented by the Rossdale
Community League
, established in 1922, which maintains a
community hall
located at 101 Street and 96 Avenue.
[7]
[8]
Archaeology and history
[
edit
]
The site of the Rossdale powerplant was a
First Nations
campsite from the time that people first moved into the Edmonton area after the retreat of the glaciers around 8,000 years ago.  In the early 1800s it was used as the site for the Hudson's Bay Company's
Fort Edmonton
and the
North West Company
's Fort Augustus, although this was only a theory until 2012 when a trench thought to be part of stockade wall was unearthed.
[9]
Human remains have been discovered at the site multiple times, by EPCOR workers and archaeologists, from at least the 1960s to 2010s.
[10]
[11]
After a protest about the city's lack of consultation with the indigenous community, the provincial government directed the city to consult with the
Papaschase
band, other
First Nations
and the
Métis Nation of Alberta
.
[11]
In 2005 and 2016, unearthed human remains were re-interred.
[11]
[12]
In 2007, a monument commonly known as the Rossdale Memorial was constructed to mark the desecrated burial ground.
[13]
Demographics
[
edit
]
In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Rossdale had a population of
819
living in
504
dwellings,
[6]
a -4.7% change from its 2009 population of
859
.
[14]
With a land area of 0.91 km
2
(0.35 sq mi),
[5]
it had a population density of
900
people/km
2
in 2012.
[5]
[6]
Residential development
[
edit
]
While Rossdale is an older neighbourhood with residential development beginning during the early years of Edmonton's history, there has been a significant redevelopment of the area in more recent years.
According to the 2001 federal census, only one residence in ten (9.9%) in modern Rossdale was built before the end of
World War II
.  Another one in five residences (17.6%) were built between
1946
and
1970
and one residence in ten (11.0%) were built during the 1970s. One in four residences (24.2%) were built during the 1980s and two out of five (37.4%) were built during the 1990s.
[15]
The most common type of residence in Rossdale, according to the 2005 municipal census, is a mixture of
rented
apartments
and apartment style
condominiums
. These account for half (51%) of all residences in the neighbourhood. Two out of three of these residences are in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories while one in three are in high-rise buildings with five or more stories.
Single-family dwellings
account for one out of every three (35%) of all residences in the neighbourhood.
Row houses
account for one in ten residences (10%).  Four percent of all residences are
duplexes
.
[16]
Three out of every five (62%) are owner-occupied while two out of five (38%) are rented.
[17]
RE/MAX Field
[
edit
]
RE/MAX Field
, Edmonton's main
baseball
stadium, is located in this neighbourhood.  The stadium hosts the
Edmonton Riverhawks
of the
West Coast League
as of the 2021 season. It was home to the
Edmonton Prospects
baseball team of the
Western Canadian Baseball League
from 2012-2020. The
Edmonton Trappers
of the AAA
Pacific Coast League
also called RE/MAX Field, then known as Telus Field, home up to the end of the 2004 season, when the franchise was moved to another city.
Rossdale Power Plant
[
edit
]
Rossdale Power Plant in 2010.
Main article:
Rossdale Power Plant
Located next to RE/MAX Field is the Rossdale Power Plant, used by
EPCOR
to generate electricity. Originally built by the Edmonton Electric Lighting and Power Company, the owner
Alex Taylor
, sold the company to the city of Edmonton in 1902.  The plant was shut down by EPCOR in 2009.
[18]
The plant sits on, and adjacent to, a native burial ground,
[19]
and was named a provincial historic resource in 2001.
[20]
EPCOR also operates the Rossdale water treatment plant located next to the power plant. The water treatment plant was constructed in 1903 and remains in operation.
[21]
Population mobility
[
edit
]
The population in Rossdale is highly mobile. According to the 2005 municipal census, one in five (21.5%) of all residents had moved within the previous twelve months.  Another one in five (22.4%) had moved within the previous one to three years. Only two out of every five (42%) residents had lived at the same address for five years or longer.

James T. White
(August 25, 1837 - March 13, 1892) was a
Baptist
minister
and state legislator from
Helena
and
Little Rock
, Arkansas. He was a member of the
Arkansas House of Representatives
and later the
Arkansas Senate
in the late 1860s and early 1870s. He was also a member of the
Arkansas constitutional
conventions in 1868 and 1874. He edited the Baptist newspaper,
The Arkansas Review
. He was an African American and a
Republican
. In 1868 he was among the first six African Americans to serve in the Arkansas House.
[1]
Early life
[
edit
]
White was born in
New Providence
, Indiana, to James and Catharine White. The family moved to the capital city of
Indianapolis
in 1850. His parents had died by 1860. White joined the Baptist church at the age of 17 and became a minister at the age of 21.
[2]
In the spring of 1865, he was sent to the Consolidated American Baptist Convention held in
St. Louis
Missouri
.
[2]
In May of that year, more than 600 Baptist clergymen and a large number of lay delegates attended a number of concurrent conventions in that city. The largest such organization was the
American Baptist Union
. Other groups that met included the American Baptist Publication Society, the
American Baptist Home Mission Society
, and the
American Baptist Education Society
.
[3]
While there, he was invited to Helena, Arkansas, where, on August 21, 1865, he became a pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Helena.
[2]
White moved to Helena with a unit of African-American
Union Army
soldiers.
[4]
The situation in Helena was uneasy. A part of the
Confederacy
, many Arkansas veterans resented the presence of newly freed slaves. White became pastor of a church that met in a government stable until Colonel
Charles Bentzoni
of the
56th United States Colored Infantry
permitted them to move into the old Cumberland church, where services were held for two years until White was able to build a small house for services.
[2]
Move to Arkansas and career
[
edit
]
Political success
[
edit
]
In 1867, White organized an Arkansas Missionary Baptist convention in the capital city of Little Rock. In 1868, White supported
Reconstruction
efforts and, in the fall of that year, he was elected to the state convention to frame a new constitution for Arkansas.
[2]
He was one of eight black delegates at the convention, along with J. W. Mason, Richard Samuels, William Murphy, Monroe Hawkins, William Grey, Henry Rector, and Thomas P. Johnson.
[5]
He was a strong advocate for black enfranchisement, and, after the convention, opposed the imposition of a
poll tax
that would restrict the ability of poor blacks to vote.
[6]
He was then elected to the state House of Representatives
[7]
serving the 11th district, which consisted of
Phillips
and
Monroe
counties. He served on the penitentiary committee, the committee on impeachment and removal from office, and the committee on miscellaneous provisions.
[8]
He was reelected to the house twice, and then elected to the state Senate, where he served one term
[2]
in 1871.
[5]
He was then appointed to the position of commissioner of public works and internal improvements.
[2]
In the 1868 and 1869 sessions, there were seven blacks in the Arkansas Legislature. In the 1871 session, there were eleven in the House and two, J. W. Mason and White, in the Senate.
[5]
In 1872, white newspapers in Arkansas noted a split in the Phillips County black leadership between White and H. B. Robinson.
[9]
In the 1873 session, there were 20 African Americans in the Arkansas legislature, four in the Senate and 16 in the House. James' brother, Rev.
R. B. White
represented Pulaski in the upper body of the general assembly.
[10]
White was defeated in campaigns for legislature in 1873
[11]
and 1881.
[12]
During this time, he continued his work as a minister, and he succeeded in building two new churches, one in Helena and another in Little Rock. The church in Little Rock was destroyed by fire but rebuilt. He also organized the first Baptist District Association for Arkansas.
[2]
In 1874, White was attacked by a group of Democrats and thrown into the
Mississippi River
, which ran beside Helena.
[13]
Political failures and later career
[
edit
]
Early in 1874, Republican
Governor
Elisha Baxter
moved to re-enfranchise former Confederate soldiers, a move that alienated many of his base. His opponent in the 1872 election,
Joseph Brooks
, was then declared governor by a county judge who declared that election to be fraudulent. Each side raised militias mostly of black men, who fought several bloody battles, known as the
Brooks-Baxter War
. Phillips County Republicans desired to raise men to fight for Brooks, and White made a largely successful effort to prevent Phillips County men from joining.
[14]
Later in 1874, White was elected to a second convention for the writing of a new state constitution. He then endeavored to raise money for a college, which was to be known as Helena University. This project failed, and White turned his effort to other work.
[2]
The organization was led by Rev. George Priest of Jonestown, Mississippi, Rev. Moses Proffit of Phillips County, and White.
[15]
Many elected and appointed positions in Phillips County were held by blacks from Reconstruction until about 1878. White played an important role in this, supporting an alliance between blacks (who were mostly Republican) and conservative white Democrats. Beyond White's legislative seats, blacks held positions as coroners and assessors, and H. B. Robinson served as county sheriff from 1874-1878,
[16]
defeating White in an election for that position in October 1874. In 1876, White ran for the position of circuit court clerk and lost. He then ran for the position of chancery clerk,
[17]
but lost.
[18]
In 1884, he began to work for the Benevolent and Church Aid Society and became editor of
The Arkansas Review
.
[2]
In 1886, he was a delegate at the American National Baptist Convention led by
William J. Simmons
and
Richard DeBaptiste
. A major issue facing the group was unifying black Baptists for mutual support and to increase their "race confidence" as
Solomon T. Clanton
put it in a presentation of a paper he wrote. White's contribution included noted the importance of economic progress, how black Baptists were looked down upon in comparison to black Methodists, and especially the need for loyalty to the denomination.
[19]
White was involved in
Freemasonry
.
[20]
He was an active worker for education and helped organize public schools in Helena and in 1873 was a member of the
Helena Public Schools
' board of directors.
[21]
Death
[
edit
]
White resigned from the pastorate of the Second Baptist Church in Helena in March 1891.
[22]
He died a year later of
pneumonia
in Helena, Arkansas.

Demarcation dispute
[
edit
]
In 2015, the Municipal Demarcation Board decided to excise Mashau and Masakona settlements from Makhado, and merge them with the
Malamulele
, Tshikonelo, Mulenzhe, Pietboy, and Khakhanwa areas of the
Thulamela Local Municipality
in order to create a new municipality.
[2]
[3]
In 2016, residents dissatisfied with legal rulings that affirmed the Municipal Demarcation Board's decision resorted to arson and vandalism of 30 schools over a four-month period,
[4]
[5]
[6]
disrupting government services and schooling.
[3]
A resultant stay-away during the 2016 local election depressed voter turnout, with only 1,600 voters participating, but the ANC was nevertheless reelected.
[7]
Destruction of government property and disruption of learning continued into April, 2017 and led to the death of two persons.

Geography
(from
Greek
:
γεωγραφία
,
geographia
. Combination of Greek words 'Geo' (The Earth) and 'Graphien' (to describe), literally "earth description") is a field of
science
devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of
Earth
.
[1]
Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and
its human and natural complexities
—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of
planetary science
.
[2]
Geography has been called "a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines."
[3]
The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as a title of a book by Greek scholar
Eratosthenes
(276-194 BC).
[1]
However, the concepts of geography (such as
cartography
) date back to the earliest attempts to understand the world spatially, with the earliest example of an attempted world map dating to the 9th century BCE in ancient
Babylon
.
[4]
The
history of geography
as a discipline spans cultures and millennia, being independently developed by multiple groups, and cross-pollinated by trade between these groups. The core concepts of geography consistent between all approaches are a focus on space, place, time, and scale.
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
Today, geography is an extremely broad discipline with multiple approaches and modalities. There have been multiple attempts to organize the discipline, including the four traditions of geography, and into branches.
[11]
[3]
[12]
Techniques employed can generally be broken down into
quantitative
[13]
and
qualitative
[14]
approaches, with many studies taking
mixed-methods
approaches.
[15]
Common techniques include cartography, remote sensing, interviews, and surveys.
Fundamentals
Geography is a systematic study of the Earth (other celestial bodies are specified, such as "geography of Mars", or given another name, such as
areography
in the case of Mars), its features, and phenomena that take place on it.
[16]
[17]
[18]
For something to fall into the domain of geography, it generally needs some sort of spatial component that can be placed on a
map
, such as
coordinates
, place names, or
addresses
. This has led to geography being associated with
cartography
and place names. Although many geographers are trained in
toponymy
and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation.
Geographers
study the Earth's spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their
environment
.
[19]
Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health,
climate
, plants, and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and their spatial patterns.
[20]
Names of places...are not geography...To know by heart a whole gazetteer full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a geographer. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word, Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.
[21]
—
William Hughes
, 1863
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into three main branches:
human geography
,
physical geography
, and
technical geography
.
[3]
[22]
Human geography largely focuses on the
built environment
and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space.
[22]
Physical geography examines the natural environment and how
organisms
, climate,
soil
, water, and
landforms
produce and interact.
[23]
The difference between these approaches led to the development of
integrated geography
, which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.
[19]
Technical geography involves studying and developing the tools and techniques used by geographers, such as remote sensing, cartography, and geographic information system.

Space
A right-handed three-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system
used to indicate positions in space.
Just as all phenomena exist in time and thus have a history, they also exist in space and have a geography.
[25]
—
United States National Research Council
, 1997
For something to exist in the realm of geography, it must be able to be described spatially.
[25]
[26]
Thus, space is the most fundamental concept at the foundation of geography.
[5]
[6]
The concept is so basic, that geographers often have difficulty defining exactly what it is.
Absolute space
is the exact site, or spatial coordinates, of objects, persons, places, or phenomena under investigation.
[5]
We exist in space.
[7]
Absolute space leads to the view of the world as a photograph, with everything frozen in place when the coordinates were recorded. Today, geographers are trained to remember that the world is not the static image that appears on a map; and instead, the dynamic space where all processes interact and take place.
[5]
[27]
Place
Main articles:
Location
,
Place identity
, and
Sense of place
Place is one of the most complex and important terms in geography.
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
In human geography, place is the synthesis of the coordinates on the Earth's surface, the activity and use that occurs, has occurred, and will occur at the coordinates, and the meaning ascribed to the space by human individuals and groups.
[26]
[9]
This can be extraordinarily complex, as different spaces may have different uses at different times and mean different things to different people. In physical geography, a place includes all of the physical phenomena that occur in space, including the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
[10]
Places do not exist in a vacuum and instead have complex spatial relationships with each other, and place is concerned how a location is situated in relation to all other locations.
[28]
[29]
As a discipline then, the term place in geography includes all spatial phenomena occurring at a location, the diverse uses and meanings humans ascribe to that location, and how that location impacts and is impacted by all other locations on Earth.
[9]
[10]
In one of
Yi-Fu Tuan
's papers, he explains that in his view, geography is the study of Earth as a home for humanity, and thus place and the complex meaning behind the term is central to the discipline of geography.
[8]
Time
Main articles:
Time geography
and
Historical geography
Examples of the
visual language
of time geography: space-time cube, path, prism, bundle, and other concepts.
Time is usually thought to be within the domain of
history
, however, it is of significant concern in the discipline of geography.
[30]
[31]
[32]
In physics, space and time are not separated, and are combined into the concept of
spacetime
.
[33]
Geography is subject to the laws of physics, and in studying things that occur in space, time must be considered. Time in geography is more than just the historical record of events that occurred at various discrete coordinates; but also includes modeling the dynamic movement of people, organisms, and things through space.
[7]
Time facilitates movement through space, ultimately allowing things to flow through a system.
[30]
The amount of time an individual, or group of people, spends in a place will often shape their attachment and perspective to that place.
[7]
Time constrains the possible paths that can be taken through space, given a starting point, possible routes, and rate of travel.
[34]
Visualizing time over space is challenging in terms of cartography, and includes Space-Prism, advanced 3D geovisualizations, and
animated maps
.
[28]
[34]
[35]
[27]
Scale
Main articles:
Scale (geography)
,
Scale (ratio)
, and
Scale (map)
A graphical or bar scale. A map would also usually give its scale numerically ("1:50,000", for instance, means that one cm on the map represents 50,000cm of real space, which is 500 meters)
Scale in the context of a map is the ratio between a distance measured on the map and the corresponding distance as measured on the ground.
[2]
[36]
This concept is fundamental to the discipline of geography, not just cartography, in that phenomena being investigated appear different depending on the scale used.
[37]
[38]
Scale is the frame that geographers use to measure space, and ultimately to try and understand a place.
[36]
Laws of geography
Main article:
Quantitative geography § Laws of geography
Waldo Tobler in front of the Newberry Library. Chicago, November 2007
During the quantitative revolution, geography shifted to an empirical law-making (
nomothetic
) approach.
[39]
[40]
Several
laws of geography
have been proposed since then, most notably by
Waldo Tobler
and can be viewed as a product of the quantitative revolution.
[41]
In general, some dispute the entire concept of laws in geography and the social sciences.
[28]
[42]
[43]
These criticisms have been addressed by Tobler and others, such as
Michael Frank Goodchild
.
[42]
[43]
However, this is an ongoing source of debate in geography and is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Several laws have been proposed, and Tobler's first law of geography is the most generally accepted in geography. Some have argued that geographic laws do not need to be numbered. The existence of a first invites a second, and many have proposed themselves as that. It has also been proposed that Tobler's first law of geography should be moved to the second and replaced with another.
[43]
A few of the proposed laws of geography are below:
Tobler's first law of geography
: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant"
[28]
[42]
[43]
Tobler's second law of geography
: "The phenomenon external to a geographic area of interest affects what goes on inside."
[42]
[44]
Arbia's law of geography
: "Everything is related to everything else, but things observed at a coarse spatial resolution are more related than things observed at a finer resolution."
[37]
[42]
[38]
[45]
[46]
The uncertainty principle: "That the geographic world is infinitely complex and that any representation must therefore contain elements of uncertainty, that many definitions used in acquiring geographic data contain elements of vagueness, and that it is impossible to measure location on the Earth's surface exactly."
[43]
Additionally, several variations or amendments to these laws exist within the literature, although not as well supported. For example, one paper proposed an amendmended version of Tobler's first law of geography, referred to in the text as "The Tobler-von Thünen law."
[41]
This proposed variation of Tobler's first law states, "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things,
as a consequence of accessibility.
"
[41]
Sub-disciplines
Geography is a branch of inquiry that focuses on spatial information on Earth. It is an extremely broad topic and can be broken down multiple ways.
[12]
There have been several approaches to doing this spanning at least several centuries, including "four traditions of geography" and into distinct branches.
[47]
[11]
The Four traditions of geography are often used to divide the different historical approaches theories geographers have taken to the discipline.
[11]
In contrast, geography's branches describe contemporary applied geographical approaches.
[3]
Four traditions of geography
Geography is an extremely broad field. Because of this, many view the various definitions of geography proposed over the decades as inadequate. To address this,
William D. Pattison
proposed the concept of the "Four traditions of Geography" in 1964.
[11]
[48]
[49]
These traditions are the Spatial or Locational Tradition, the Man-Land or Human-Environment Interaction Tradition, the Area Studies or Regional Tradition, and the Earth Science Tradition.
[11]
[48]
[49]
These concepts are broad sets of geography philosophies bound together within the discipline. They are one of many ways geographers organize the major sets of thoughts and philosophies within the discipline.
[11]
[48]
[49]
Spatial or locational tradition
Main article:
Spatial Analysis
The spatial or locational tradition is concerned with employing quantitative methods to describe the spatial characteristics of a location.
[11]
[48]
[49]
The spatial tradition seeks to use the spatial characteristics of a location or phenomena to understand and explain it. The contributors to this tradition were historically cartographers, but it now encompasses what we call technical geography and geographic information science.
[49]
Area studies or regional tradition
Main articles:
Regional geography
and
Area studies
The area studies or regional tradition is concerned with the description of the unique characteristics of the earth's surface, resulting in each area from the combination of its complete natural or elements, as of physical and human environment.
[11]
[48]
[49]
[50]
The main aim is to understand, or define the uniqueness, or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to
regionalization
, which covers the proper techniques of space
delimitation
into regions.
Human-Environment interaction tradition
Main article:
Integrated geography
The Human Environment Interaction tradition (originally the Man-Land), also known as
Integrated geography
, is concerned with the description of the spatial interactions between humans and the
natural world
.
[11]
[48]
[49]
[51]
It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, like how human societies conceptualize the environment. Integrated geography has emerged as a bridge between human and physical geography due to the increasing specialization of the two sub-fields, or branches.
[26]
Earth science tradition
Main article:
Earth science
The
Earth science
tradition is largely concerned with what is generally referred to as physical geography.
[11]
[48]
[49]
The tradition focuses on understanding the spatial characteristics of natural phenomena. Some argue the Earth science tradition is a subset of the spatial tradition, however the two are different enough in their focus and objectives to warrant separation.
[49]
Branches of geography
Main page:
Category:Branches of geography
Within the traditions mentioned above, geography is organized into applied branches.
[52]
[53]
The
UNESCO
Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems
organizes geography into the three categories of
human geography
,
physical geography
, and
technical geography
.
[3]
[54]
[52]
[12]
Some publications limit the number of branches to physical and human, describing them as the principal branches.
[26]
Geographers rarely focus on just one of these topics, often using one as their primary focus and then incorporating data and methods from the other branches. Often, geographers are asked to describe what they do by individuals outside the discipline
[8]
and are likely to identify closely with a specific branch, or sub-branch when describing themselves to lay people. Human geography studies people and their communities, cultures, economies, and environmental interactions by studying their relations with and across space and place.
[26]
Physical geography is concerned with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the
atmosphere
,
hydrosphere
,
biosphere
, and
geosphere
.
[26]
Technical geography is interested in studying and applying techniques and methods to store, process, analyze, visualize, and use spatial data.
[53]
It is the newest of the branches, the most controversial, and often other terms are used in the literature to describe the emerging category. These branches use similar geographic philosophies, concepts, and tools and often overlap significantly.
Physical
Main article:
Physical geography
Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an
Earth science
.
[55]
[56]
[57]
It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of
lithosphere
,
hydrosphere
,
atmosphere
,
pedosphere
, and global
flora
and
fauna
patterns (
biosphere
). Physical geography is the study of earth's seasons,
climate
,
atmosphere
,
soil
, streams, landforms, and oceans.
[58]
Physical geographers will often work in identifying and monitoring the use of natural resources.
Physical geography can be divided into many broad categories, including:
Biogeography
Climatology
and
meteorology
Coastal geography
Environmental management
Geomorphology
Glaciology
Hydrology
and
hydrography
Landscape ecology
Oceanography
Palaeogeography
Pedology
Quaternary science
Human
Main article:
Human geography
Human geography (or anthropogeography) is a branch of geography that focuses on studying patterns and processes that shape human society.
[59]
It encompasses the human, political,
cultural
, social, and economic aspects. In industry, human geographers often work in city planning, public health, or business analysis.
Human geography can be divided into many broad categories, such as:
Cognitive geography
Cultural geography
Development geography
Economic geography
Health geography
Historical geography
Internet geography
Political geography
and
Geopolitics
Population geography
or
Demography
Religion geography
Social geography
Transportation geography
Tourism geography
Urban geography
Various approaches to the study of human geography have also arisen through time and include:
Behavioral geography
Culture theory
Feminist geography
Geosophy
Technical
Main article:
Technical geography
Technical geography concerns studying and developing tools, techniques, and statistical methods employed to collect, analyze, use, and understand spatial data.
[24]
[3]
[52]
[54]
Technical geography is the most recently recognized, and controversial, of the branches. Its use dates back to 1749, when a book published by
Edward Cave
organized the discipline into a section containing content such as cartographic techniques and globes.
[47]
There are several other terms, often used interchangeably with technical geography to subdivide the discipline, including "techniques of geographic analysis,"
[60]
"Geographic Information Technology,"
[1]
"Geography method's and techniques,"
[61]
"
Geographic Information Science
,"
[62]
"
geoinformatics
," "
geomatics
," and "information geography". There are subtle differences to each concept and term; however, technical geography is one of the broadest, is consistent with the naming convention of the other two branches, has been in use since the 1700s, and has been used by the
UNESCO
Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems
to divide geography into themes.
[3]
[52]
[47]
As academic fields increasingly specialize in their nature, technical geography has emerged as a branch of geography specializing in geographic methods and thought.
[24]
The emergence of technical geography has brought new relevance to the broad discipline of geography by serving as a set of unique methods for managing the interdisciplinary nature of the phenomena under investigation. While human and physical geographers use the techniques employed by technical geographers, technical geography is more concerned with the fundamental spatial concepts and technologies than the nature of the data.
[24]
[53]
It is therefore closely associated with the spatial tradition of geography while being applied to the other two major branches. A technical geographer might work as a GIS analyst, a GIS developer working to make new software tools, or create general reference maps incorporating human and natural features.
[63]
Technical geography can be divided into many broad categories, such as:
Geodesign
Geodesy
Geoinformatics
Geographic information science
Geomatics
Geovisualization
Statistical geography
Spatial analysis
Time geography
Quantitative geography
Techniques
All geographic research and analysis start with asking the question "where," followed by "why there." Geographers start with the fundamental assumption set forth in
Tobler's first law of geography
, that "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
[28]
[29]
As spatial interrelationships are key to this synoptic science, maps are a key tool. Classical
cartography
has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis, computer-based
geographic information systems
(GIS).
In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:
Analytical - Asks
why
we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.
Descriptive - Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.
Regional - Examines systematic relationships between categories for a specific region or location on the planet.
Systematic - Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.
Quantitative methods
Main articles:
Quantitative revolution
and
Quantitative geography
James Cook
's 1770 chart of New Zealand
Quantitative methods in geography became particularly influential in the discipline during the quantitative revolution of the 1950s and 60s.
[13]
These methods revitalized the discipline in many ways, allowing scientific testing of hypotheses and proposing scientific geographic theories and laws.
[64]
The quantitative revolution heavily influenced and revitalized technical geography, and lead to the development of the subfield of quantitative geography.
[24]
[13]
Geomatics
Main article:
Geomatics
Geomatics
is concerned with the application of computers to the traditional spatial techniques used in
cartography
and
topography
. Similar to the terms
geographic information science
and technical geography, geomatics emerged from the
quantitative revolution
in geography in the mid-1950s. Today, geomatics methods include
spatial analysis
,
geographic information systems
(GIS),
remote sensing
, and
global positioning systems
(GPS). Geomatics has revitalized some geography departments, especially in Northern America, where the subject had a declining status during the 1950s.
Quantitative cartography
Main article:
Cartography
Cartography is the art, science, and technology of making maps.
[65]
Cartographers study the Earth's surface representation with abstract symbols (map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately.
[66]
Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.
Cartographers must learn
cognitive psychology
and
ergonomics
to understand which symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively and
behavioural psychology
to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information. They must learn
geodesy
and fairly advanced mathematics to understand how the
shape of the Earth
affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.
Geographic information systems
Main article:
Geographic information system
Geographic information systems (GIS) deal with storing information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer in an accurate manner appropriate to the information's purpose.
[67]
In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand
computer science
and
database
systems. GIS has revolutionized the field of cartography: nearly all mapmaking is now done with the assistance of some form of
GIS software
. The science of using GIS software and GIS techniques to represent, analyse, and predict the spatial relationships is called
geographic information science
(GISc).
[68]
Remote sensing
Main article:
Remote sensing
Digital elevation model
(DEM)
Remote sensing is the art, science, and technology of obtaining information about Earth's features from measurements made at a distance.
[69]
Remotely sensed data can be either passive, such as traditional
photography
, or active, such as
LiDAR
.
[69]
A variety of platforms can be used for remote sensing, including
satellite imagery
,
aerial photography
(including consumer drones), and data obtained from hand-held sensors.
[69]
Products from remote sensing include
Digital elevation model
and cartographic base maps. Geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the Earth's
land surface
, ocean, and atmosphere, because it: (a) supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales (local to global), (b) provides a synoptic view of the area of interest, (c) allows access to distant and inaccessible sites, (d) provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum
, and (e) facilitates studies of how features/areas change over time. Remotely sensed data may be analyzed independently or in conjunction with other digital data layers (e.g., in a geographic information system). Remote sensing aids in land use, land cover (LULC) mapping, by helping to determine both what is naturally occurring on a piece of land and what human activities are taking place on it.
[70]
Geostatistics
Main article:
Geostatistics
Geostatistics
deal with
quantitative data
analysis, specifically the application of a statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena.
[71]
Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields, including
hydrology
, geology, petroleum exploration, weather analysis,
urban planning
, logistics, and
epidemiology
. The mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from
cluster analysis
,
linear discriminant analysis
and
non-parametric statistical tests
, and a variety of other subjects. Applications of geostatistics rely heavily on
geographic information systems
, particularly for the
interpolation
(estimate) of unmeasured points. Geographers are making notable contributions to the method of quantitative techniques.
Qualitative methods
Main article:
Qualitative geography
Qualitative methods geography in geography are descriptive rather than numerical or statistical in nature.
[72]
[14]
[39]
They add context to concepts, and explore human concepts like beliefs and perspective that are difficult or impossible to quantify.
[14]
Human geography is much more likely to employ qualitative methods than physical. Increasingly, technical geographers are attempting to employ GIS methods to qualitative datasets.
[14]
[73]
Qualitative cartography
Qualitative cartography employs many of the same software and techniques as quantitative.
[73]
It may be employed to inform on map practices, or to visualize perspectives and ideas that are not strictly quantitative in nature.
[73]
[14]
An example of a form of qualitative cartography is a
deep map
, or maps that combine geography and storytelling to produce a product with greater information than a two-dimensional image of places, names, and topography.
[74]
[75]
This approach offers more inclusive strategies than more traditional cartographic approaches for connecting the complex layers that makeup places.
[75]
Ethnography
Main article:
Ethnography
Ethnographical research techniques are used by human geographers.
[76]
In
cultural geography
, there is a tradition of employing
qualitative research
techniques, also used in
anthropology
and sociology.
Participant observation
and in-depth interviews provide human geographers with qualitative data.
Geopoetics
Geopoetics is an interdisciplinary approach that combines geography and
poetry
to explore the interconnectedness between humans, space, place, and the environment.
[77]
[78]
Geopoetics is employed as a
mixed methods
tool to explain the implications of geographic research.
[79]
It is often employed to address and communicate the implications of complex topics, such as the
anthropocene
.
[80]
[81]
[82]
[83]
[84]
Interviews
Main article:
Interview (research)
Geographers employ interviews to gather data and acquire valuable understandings from individuals or groups regarding their encounters, outlooks, and opinions concerning spatial phenomena.
[85]
[86]
Interviews can be carried out through various mediums, including face-to-face interactions, phone conversations, online platforms, or written exchanges.
[39]
Geographers typically adopt a structured or semi-structured approach during interviews involving specific questions or discussion points when utilized for research purposes.
[85]
These questions are designed to extract focused information about the research topic while being flexible enough to allow participants to express their experiences and viewpoints, such as through open-ended questions.
[85]
History
Main article:
History of geography
The concept of geography is present in all cultures, and therefore the history of the discipline is a series of competing narratives, with concepts emerging at various points across space and time.
[87]
The oldest known
world maps
date back to
ancient Babylon
from the 9th century BC.
[88]
The best known
Babylonian
world map, however, is the
Imago Mundi
of 600 BC.
[89]
The map as reconstructed by
Eckhard Unger
shows
Babylon
on the
Euphrates
, surrounded by a circular landmass showing
Assyria
,
Urartu
, and several cities, in turn surrounded by a "bitter river" (
Oceanus
), with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star.
[90]
The accompanying text mentions seven outer regions beyond the encircling ocean. The descriptions of five of them have survived.
[91]
In contrast to the
Imago Mundi
, an earlier Babylonian
world map
dating back to the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further north from the center of the world, though it is not certain what that center was supposed to represent.

The ideas of
Anaximander
(c. 610-545 BC): considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors.
[92]
Anaximander is credited with the invention of the
gnomon
, the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of
latitude
.
[92]
Thales
is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern
Chinese
. The
Greeks
, who were the first to explore geography as both art and science, achieved this through
Cartography
,
Philosophy
, and
Literature
, or through
Mathematics
. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the
Earth is spherical
in shape, with the credit going either to
Parmenides
or
Pythagoras
.
Anaxagoras
was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining
eclipses
. However, he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries. One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by
Eratosthenes
.
[93]
The first rigorous system of
latitude and longitude
lines is credited to
Hipparchus
. He employed a
sexagesimal
system that was derived from
Babylonian mathematics
. The meridians were subdivided into 360°, with each degree further subdivided into 60 (
minutes
). To measure the longitude at different locations on Earth, he suggested using eclipses to determine the relative difference in time.
[94]
The extensive mapping by the
Romans
as they explored new lands would later provide a high level of information for
Ptolemy
to construct detailed
atlases
. He extended the work of
Hipparchus
, using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 miles for a degree.
[95]
From the 3rd century onwards,
Chinese
methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more comprehensive than what was found in Europe at the time (until the 13th century).
[96]
Chinese geographers such as
Liu An
,
Pei Xiu
,
Jia Dan
,
Shen Kuo
,
Fan Chengda
,
Zhou Daguan
, and
Xu Xiake
wrote important treatises, yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of Western-style geography were adopted in China.

Ptolemy

Geographia

During the
Middle Ages
, the
fall of the Roman empire
led to a shift in the evolution of geography from Europe to the
Islamic world
.
[96]
Muslim geographers
such as
Muhammad al-Idrisi
produced detailed world maps (such as
Tabula Rogeriana
), while other geographers such as
Yaqut al-Hamawi
,
Abu Rayhan Biruni
,
Ibn Battuta
, and
Ibn Khaldun
provided detailed accounts of their journeys and the geography of the regions they visited. Turkish geographer
Mahmud al-Kashgari
drew a world map on a linguistic basis, and later so did
Piri Reis
(
Piri Reis map
). Further, Islamic scholars translated and
interpreted
the earlier works of the
Romans
and the
Greeks
and established the
House of Wisdom
in
Baghdad
for this purpose.
[97]
Abū Zayd al-Balkhī
, originally from
Balkh
, founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in
Baghdad
.
[98]
Suhrāb, a late tenth century Muslim geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates, with instructions for making a rectangular world map with
equirectangular projection
or cylindrical equidistant projection.
[99]
Abu Rayhan Biruni
(976-1048) first described a polar equi-
azimuthal equidistant projection
of the
celestial sphere
.
[100]
He was regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping cities and measuring the distances between them, which he did for many cities in the Middle East and the
Indian subcontinent
. He often combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations to develop methods of pin-pointing locations by recording degrees of
latitude
and
longitude
. He also developed similar techniques when it came to measuring the heights of mountains, depths of the
valleys
, and expanse of the
horizon
. He also discussed
human geography
and the
planetary habitability
of the Earth. He also calculated the
latitude
of Kath,
Khwarezm
, using the maximum altitude of the Sun, and solved a complex
geodesic
equation to accurately compute the
Earth's circumference
, which was close to modern values of the Earth's circumference.
[101]
His estimate of 6,339.9 km for the
Earth radius
was only 16.8 km less than the modern value of 6,356.7 km. In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations,
al-Biruni
developed a new method of using
trigonometric
calculations based on the angle between a
plain
and mountain top, which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference, and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location.
[102]
Self portrait of
Alexander von Humboldt
, one of the early pioneers of geography as an academic subject in modern sense
The European
Age of Discovery
during the 16th and the 17th centuries, where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as
Christopher Columbus
,
Marco Polo
, and
James Cook
revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe. The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location. The problem of latitude was solved long ago, but that of longitude remained; agreeing on what zero meridians should be was only part of the problem. It was left to
John Harrison
to solve it by inventing the chronometer
H-4
in 1760, and later in 1884 for the
International Meridian Conference
to adopt by convention the
Greenwich meridian
as zero meridians.
[101]
The 18th and 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete
academic discipline
, and became part of a typical university curriculum in Europe (especially Paris and
Berlin
). The development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century, with the foundations of the
Société de Géographie
in 1821, the
Royal Geographical Society
in 1830,
Russian Geographical Society
in 1845,
American Geographical Society
in 1851, and the
National Geographic Society
in 1888. The influence of
Immanuel Kant
,
Alexander von Humboldt
,
Carl Ritter
, and
Paul Vidal de la Blache
can be seen as a major turning point in geography from philosophy to an academic subject.

Over the past two centuries, the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of
geomatics
and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography's portfolio of tools. In the West during the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases:
environmental determinism
,
regional geography
, the
quantitative revolution
, and
critical geography
. The strong interdisciplinary links between geography and the sciences of geology and
botany
, as well as economics, sociology, and
demographics
, have also grown greatly, especially as a result of
earth system science
that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view. New concepts and philosophies have emerged from the rapid advancement of computers, quantitative methods, and interdisciplinary approaches. In 1970,
Waldo Tobler
proposed the
first law of geography
, "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
[28]
[29]
This law summarizes the first assumption geographers make about the world.

Geology
Main article:
Geology
The discipline of geography, especially physical geography, and geology have significant overlap. In the past, the two have often shared academic departments at universities, a point that has led to conflict over resources.
[112]
Both disciplines do seek to understand the
rocks
on the Earth's surface and the processes that change them over time. Geology employs many of the tools and techniques of technical geographers, such as GIS and remote sensing to aid in
geological mapping
.
[113]
However, geology includes research that goes beyond the spatial component, such as the chemical analysis of rocks and
biogeochemistry
.
[114]
History
Main article:
History
The discipline of History has significant overlap with geography, especially human geography.
[115]
[116]
Like geology, history and geography have shared university departments.  Geography provides the spatial context within which historical events unfold.
[115]
The physical geographic features of a region, such as its landforms, climate, and resources, shape human settlements, trade routes, and economic activities, which in turn influence the course of historical events.
[115]
Thus, a historian must have a strong foundation in geography.
[115]
[116]
Historians employ the techniques of technical geographers to create
historical atlases
and maps.
Planetary science
Main article:
Planetary science
While the discipline of geography is normally concerned with the Earth, the term can also be informally used to describe the study of other worlds, such as the
planets
of the
Solar System
and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of
Astronomy
or
Cosmology
. The study of other planets is usually called
planetary science
. Alternative terms such as
areography (geography of Mars)
have been employed to describe the study of other celestial objects. Ultimately, geography may be considered a subdiscipline within planetary science.

Public debt $ and %GDP (2010) for selected European countries
Government debt
of Eurozone, Germany and crisis countries compared to Eurozone GDP
The
European debt crisis
is an ongoing
financial crisis
that has made it difficult or impossible for some countries in the
euro area
to repay or
re-finance
their
government debt
without the assistance of third parties.
The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from the structural problem of the eurozone and a combination of complex factors, including the
globalisation of finance
; easy credit conditions during the 2002-2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the
2008 global financial crisis
; international trade imbalances;
real-estate bubbles
that have since burst; the
2008-2012 global recession
; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socialising losses.
[1]
[2]
One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000-2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This "Giant Pool of Money" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by
U.S. Treasury bonds
sought alternatives globally.
[3]
The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating
bubble
after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the
solvency
of governments and their banking systems.
[1]
How each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years.
[4]
Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (
external debts
) several times
GDP
.
[1]
[5]
The interconnection in the
global financial system
means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on.
This is referred to as
financial contagion
.
[6]
[7]
Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called
credit default swaps
(CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds).
But, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS.
[8]
Greece, Italy and other countries tried to artificially reduce their budget deficits deceiving EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks.
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
[15]
Although some financial institutions clearly profited in the short run,
[9]
there was a long lead-up to the crisis.

Germany
In 1992, members of the European Union signed the
Maastricht Treaty
, under which they pledged to limit their
deficit spending
and debt levels. However, a number of EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules, failing to abide by their own internal guidelines, sidestepping best practice and ignoring internationally agreed standards.
[16]
This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions
[16]
as well as the use of complex currency and
credit derivatives
structures.
[17]
[18]
The complex structures were designed by prominent U.S.
investment banks
, who received substantial fees in return for their services.
[9]
The adoption of the euro led to many Eurozone countries of different credit worthiness receiving similar and very low interest rates for their bonds and private credits during years preceding the crisis, which author
Michael Lewis
referred to as "a sort of implicit Germany guarantee."
[4]
As a result, creditors in countries with originally weak currencies (and higher interest rates) suddenly enjoyed much more favorable credit terms, which spurred private and government spending and led to an economic boom. In some countries, such as Ireland and Spain, low interest rates also led to a housing bubble, which burst at the height of the financial crisis.
[19]
[20]
Commentators such as
Bernard Connolly
highlighted this as the fundamental problem of the euro.
[21]
A number of economists have dismissed the popular belief that the debt crisis was caused by excessive social welfare spending. According to their analysis, increased debt levels were mostly due to the large bailout packages provided to the financial sector during the
late-2000s financial crisis
, and the global economic slowdown thereafter. The average
fiscal deficit
in the euro area in 2007 was only 0.6% before it grew to 7% during the financial crisis. In the same period, the average government debt rose from 66% to 84% of GDP. The authors also stressed that fiscal deficits in the euro area were stable or even shrinking since the early 1990s.
[22]
US economist
Paul Krugman
named Greece as the only country where fiscal irresponsibility is at the heart of the crisis.
[23]
British economic historian
Robert Skidelsky
added that it was indeed excessive lending by banks, not deficit spending that created this crisis. Government's mounting debts are a response to the economic downturn as spending rises and tax revenues fall, not its cause.
[24]
Government deficit
of Eurozone compared to USA and UK
Either way, high debt levels alone may not explain the crisis. According to
The Economist Intelligence Unit
, the position of the euro area looked "no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK."
[25]
[26]
The budget deficit for the euro area as a whole (see graph) is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the US. Moreover, private-sector indebtedness across the euro area is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged
Anglo-Saxon economies
.
[25]
Trade imbalances
[
edit
]
Current account balances relative to GDP (2010)
Commentator and
Financial Times
journalist
Martin Wolf
has asserted that the root of the crisis was growing
trade imbalances
.
He notes in the run-up to the crisis, from 1999 to 2007, Germany had a considerably better public debt and fiscal deficit relative to GDP than the most affected eurozone members. In the same period, these countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain) had far worse balance of payments positions.
[27]
[28]
Whereas German trade surpluses increased as a percentage of GDP after 1999, the deficits of Italy, France and Spain all worsened.
Paul Krugman
wrote in 2009 that a trade deficit by definition requires a corresponding inflow of capital to fund it, which can drive down interest rates and stimulate the creation of bubbles: "For a while, the inrush of capital created the illusion of wealth in these countries, just as it did for American homeowners: asset prices were rising, currencies were strong, and everything looked fine. But bubbles always burst sooner or later, and yesterday’s miracle economies have become today’s basket cases, nations whose assets have evaporated but whose debts remain all too real."
[29]
A trade deficit can also be affected by changes in relative labour costs, which made southern nations less competitive and increased trade imbalances. Since 2001, Italy's unit labour costs rose 32 % relative to Germany's.
[30]
[31]
Greek unit labour costs rose much faster than Germany's during the last decade.
[32]
However, most EU nations had increases in labour costs greater than Germany's.
[33]
Those nations that allowed "wages to grow faster than productivity" lost competitiveness.
[28]
Germany's restrained labour costs, while a debatable factor in trade imbalances,
[33]
are an important factor for its low unemployment rate.
[34]
More recently, Greece's trading position has improved;
[35]
in the period 2011 to 2012, imports dropped 20.9% while exports grew 16.9%, reducing the trade deficit by 42.8%.
[35]
Simon Johnson
explains the hope for
convergence
in the Eurozone and what went wrong. The euro locks countries into an exchange rate amounting to "very big bet that their economies would converge in productivity." If not, workers would move to countries with greater productivity. Instead the opposite happened: the gap between German and Greek productivity increased, resulting in a large current account surplus financed by capital flows. The capital flows could have been invested to increase productivity in the peripheral nations. Instead capital flows were squandered in consumption and consumptive investments.
[36]
Further, Eurozone countries with sustained trade surpluses (i.e., Germany) do not see their currency appreciate relative to the other Eurozone nations due to a common currency, keeping their exports artificially cheap. Germany's trade surplus within the Eurozone declined in 2011 as its trading partners were less able to find financing necessary to fund their trade deficits, but Germany's trade surplus outside the Eurozone has soared as the euro declined in value relative to the dollar and other currencies.
[37]
Economic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels. Economist
Paul Krugman
wrote in March 2013: "...the really strong relationship within the [eurozone countries] is between interest spreads and current account deficits, which is in line with the conclusion many of us have reached, that the euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis, not a debt crisis."
[38]
A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that, "Countries with debt above 80 % of GDP and persistent current-account [trade] deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration..."
[39]
[40]
[41]
Structural problem of Eurozone system
[
edit
]
One theory is that these problems are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the theory is that there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions).
[42]
In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in
fiscal policies
in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the
European Central Bank
, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision-making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.
[43]
In addition, as of June 2012 there was no "banking union" meaning that there was no Europe-wide approach to bank deposit insurance, bank oversight, or a joint means of recapitalisation or resolution (wind-down) of failing banks.
[44]
Bank deposit insurance helps avoid
bank runs
. Recapitalisation refers to injecting money into banks so that they can meet their immediate obligations and resume lending, as was done in 2008 in the U.S. via the
Troubled Asset Relief Programme
.
[45]
Columnist
Thomas L. Friedman
wrote in June 2012: "In Europe, hyperconnectedness both exposed just how uncompetitive some of their economies were, but also how interdependent they had become. It was a deadly combination. When countries with such different cultures become this interconnected and interdependent - when they share the same currency but not the same work ethics, retirement ages or budget discipline - you end up with German savers seething at Greek workers, and vice versa."
[46]
Monetary policy inflexibility
[
edit
]
Further information:
Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union
Membership in the Eurozone established a single
monetary policy
, preventing individual member states from acting independently. In particular they cannot
create Euros
in order to pay creditors and eliminate their risk of default. Since they share the same currency as their (eurozone) trading partners, they cannot
devalue
their currency to make their exports cheaper, which in principle would lead to an improved
balance of trade
, increased GDP and higher tax revenues in
nominal terms
.
[47]
In the reverse direction moreover, assets held in a currency which has devalued suffer losses on the part of those holding them.
For example, by the end of 2011, following a 25 % fall in the rate of exchange and 5 % rise in inflation, eurozone investors in
Pound sterling
, locked into euro exchange rates, had suffered an approximate 30 % cut in the repayment value of this debt.
[48]
Loss of confidence
[
edit
]
Sovereign
CDS
prices of selected European countries (2010-2015). The left axis is in
basis points
; a level of 1,000 means it costs $1 million to protect $10 million of debt for five years.
Prior to development of the crisis it was assumed by both regulators and banks that sovereign debt from the eurozone was safe. Banks had substantial holdings of bonds from weaker economies such as Greece which offered a small premium and seemingly were equally sound. As the crisis developed it became obvious that Greek, and possibly other countries', bonds offered substantially more risk. Contributing to lack of information about the risk of European sovereign debt was
conflict of interest
by banks that were earning substantial sums underwriting the bonds.
[49]
The loss of confidence is marked by rising sovereign CDS prices, indicating market expectations about countries' creditworthiness (see graph).
Furthermore, investors have doubts about the possibilities of policy makers to quickly contain the crisis. Since countries that use the euro as their currency have fewer monetary policy choices (e.g., they cannot print money in their own currencies to pay debt holders), certain solutions require multi-national cooperation. Further, the
European Central Bank
has an inflation control mandate but not an employment mandate, as opposed to the
U.S. Federal Reserve
, which has a dual mandate.
According to
The Economist
, the crisis "is as much political as economic" and the result of the fact that the euro area is not supported by the institutional paraphernalia (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state.
[25]
Heavy bank withdrawals have occurred in weaker Eurozone states such as Greece and Spain.
[50]
Bank deposits in the Eurozone are insured, but by agencies of each member government. If banks fail, it is unlikely the government will be able to fully and promptly honour their commitment, at least not in euros, and there is the possibility that they might abandon the euro and revert to a national currency; thus, euro deposits are safer in Dutch, German, or Austrian banks than they are in Greece or Spain.
[51]
As of June 2012, many European banking systems were under significant stress, particularly Spain. A series of "capital calls" (notices that banks required capital) contributed to a freeze in funding markets and interbank lending, as investors worried that banks might be hiding losses or were losing trust in one another.
[52]
[53]
In June 2012, as the euro hit new lows, there were reports that the wealthy were moving assets out of the Eurozone,
[54]
and within the Eurozone from the south to the north. Between June 2011 and June 2012 Spain and Italy alone  lost 286 bn and 235 bn euros respectively. Altogether, Mediterranean countries have lost assets worth 10% of their GDP since capital flight started at the end of 2010.
[55]
Mario Draghi
, president of the European Central Bank, has called for an integrated European system of
deposit insurance
, which would require European political institutions to design effective solutions for problems beyond the limits of the power of the European Central Bank.
[56]
As of 6 June 2012, closer integration of European banking appeared to be under consideration by political leaders.
[57]
Households' risk aversion
[
edit
]
Portfolio data and repeated surveys of an Italian bank's clients have shown that investors' risk aversion substantially increased after the 2008 crisis. This encouraged individuals to divest more stock.
[58]
From a macroeconomic perspective, risk aversion was an important mechanism underlying financial decisions, output, and real money balance dynamics during the European debt crisis.
[59]
Interest on long term sovereign debt
[
edit
]
In June 2012, following negotiation of the Spanish bailout line of credit, interest rates on long-term Spanish and Italian debt continued to rise rapidly, casting doubt on the efficacy of bailout packages as anything more than a stopgap measure. The Spanish rate, over 6% before the line of credit was approved, approached 7%, a rough rule of thumb indicator of serious trouble.
[60]
Rating agency views
[
edit
]
On 5 December 2011,
S&P
placed its long-term
sovereign ratings
on 15 members of the eurozone on "CreditWatch" with negative implications; S&P wrote that this was due to "systemic stresses from five interrelated factors:
Tightening credit conditions across the eurozone;
Markedly higher risk premiums on a growing number of eurozone sovereigns including some that are currently rated 'AAA';
Continuing disagreements among European policy makers on how to tackle the immediate market confidence crisis and, longer term, how to ensure greater economic, financial, and fiscal convergence among eurozone members;
High levels of government and household indebtedness across a large area of the eurozone; and
The rising risk of economic recession in the eurozone as a whole in 2012. Currently, we expect output to decline next year in countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, but we now assign a 40% probability of a fall in output for the eurozone as a whole."

from the toy line
Transformers
)
[1]
is a
species
of
ant
in the
subfamily
Myrmicinae
.
Habitat and distribution
[
edit
]
Pheidole decepticon
is a relatively widespread megacephala group species on the islands neighboring
Madagascar
. It occurs on the
Comoros
(
Anjouan Island
),
Mayotte
,
Juan de Nova Island
, and on the
Cosmoledo Atoll
of the
Seychelles
, which is located about 415 km northeast of Mayotte.
Morphologically
very similar to
P. megacephala
and
P. megatron
, the three are the only megacephala group species currently encountered on the smaller islands. Other species, such as the previously reported
P. punctulata
, were not collected recently on any of the islands. On Anjouan Island
P. decepticon
occurs together with
P. megacephala
and
P. megatron
. The latter was collected in
lowland
dry forest, coastal scrub land, and in a
coconut
plantation, while
P. decepticon
was found in rainforest, lowland coastal forest,
Casuarina
forest, old settlements, coral karst scrubland, and along roadsides.
Pheidole megacephala
was not found in forested habitats on Anjouan, but was collected once from within a coastal village. Whether the other two species occur in direct
sympatry
, or if they are spatially or ecologically separated is not known.
[1]
Description
[
edit
]
The minor and major workers of
P. decepticon
are best separated from those of the other two species (
P. megacephala
and
P. megatron
) by their standing hairs, which are more abundant, fine and acute compared to the more sparsely distributed standing hairs that often end in blunt or bifurcate apices in
P. megacephala
and
P. megatron
. In addition, the
postpetiolar
ventral process of the major workers is less roundly convex and slightly smaller in the
P. decepticon
specimens.

Aleph Samach
אס
The Aleph Samach Seal, 1900.
Founded
1893
; 130 years ago
(
1893
)
Type
Junior honor society
Headquarters
Ithaca, New York
Aleph Samach
(
אס
) was a junior honor society at
Cornell University
that existed from 1893 until 1981. It was founded on four pillars: leadership, loyalty, service, and honor. Unlike most collegiate secret societies, which have primarily senior membership, Aleph Samach was composed mostly of juniors. While senior members played an advisory role within the society, Aleph Samach's primary goal was "to promote the greater good of the Cornell community by connecting junior leaders, cultivating their leadership skills, and developing their commitment to campus service."
History
[
edit
]
Aleph Samach (sometimes spelled Aleph Samech) was founded in 1893 at Cornell University as an honorary society for men of the junior class. Aleph Samach can document its operational status as late as AY 1964-1965 and AY 1978-79 and AY 1980-81.
[1]
Like many societies at Cornell, it sought to recognize those men of distinct character who were emerging leaders on campus. The society remained strong in its early decades and was an influential organization on campus. Along with some of the other class societies,
[2]
Most notably
Quill and Dagger
and
Sphinx Head
, it promoted campus-wide agendas; some of the more notable results being the creation of what would become
Slope Day
.
[3]
By 1896,
The New York Times
listed Aleph Samach as the junior class society at Cornell, alongside the Chancery (senior law), Sphinx Head (senior), Quill and Dagger (senior), and Theta Nu Epsilon (sophomore)
[4]
societies.
[5]
The turn of the century saw Aleph Samach integrated into the senior honorary societies system of campus-wide governance. Aleph Samach was a stepping stone to Sphinx Head and Quill and Dagger. The sophomore society, Theta Nu Epsilon, was a debauched institution. This led one Cornell fraternity,
Phi Kappa Psi
, to bar membership in Theta Nu Epsilon. Aleph Samach, Sphinx Head, and Quill and Dagger, however, emerged in the first decade of the 20th century as the lead institutions of Cornell undergraduate governance.
[6]
By 1917, the sophomore class was without an honorary society following the collapse of Theta Nu Epsilon's successor, Dunstan. And the senior honorary societies, formerly the apex of Cornell student governance, had been dispossessed of their oligarchy by the Student Council. But Aleph Samach was still the uncontested honorary society of the junior class.
[7]
After the creation of a unified Student Council following the
First World War
, the honorary societies nonetheless remained an active force. Aleph Samach joined with the council, Sphinx Head, and Quill and Dagger in the fall 1920 to petition the Cornell Board of Trustees to elevate the popular Acting President to the position of president until the university chose a new head.
[8]
In 1939, Aleph Samach was listed as a junior class co-honorary society with Cornell's Red Key Society.
[9]
Symbols and traditions
[
edit
]
"
Aleph
" and "
Samach
" are letters of the Hebrew language. Most of the rituals of Aleph Samach are secret.
Membership
[
edit
]
Members are tapped for membership in Aleph Samach in the spring of their sophomore year or fall of their junior year. Selection is based on participation in extra-curricular activities.
[10]
Aleph Samach was an all-male institution. Cornell had a separate but equal honorary society for junior women, Raven and Serpent.
[11]
During the "Club War" of 1913-1914, Aleph Samach allied itself with
The Cornell Daily Sun
,
Sphinx Head
, and
Quill and Dagger
to suppress the growing influence of the following "social clubs" or drinking societies at Cornell: Majura, Beth l'Amed, Kappa Beta Phi, Bench and Board, Gemel Kharm, Yonan, Mermaid, Krug and Tafel, and the Climax. The three honorary societies and the Sun would not allow any member of the drinking societies to be tapped into their organizations. During the fall of 1913,
Quill and Dagger
took the largest hit in membership, as many members of the Class of 1914 were members of the drinking societies.

Playing career

Erika Maria Grahm
(born 26 January 1991) is a Swedish retired
ice hockey
forward
and current general manager of
Brynäs IF Dam
in the
Swedish Women's Hockey League
(SDHL).
[1]
During her playing career, she was a two-time Olympian with the
Swedish national ice hockey team
.
[2]
[3]
[4]
She is the fourth highest scorer in the history of the SDHL and all-time leading scorer for
Modo Hockey
, who she captained from 2010 until her departure in 2018.
Playing career
[
edit
]
Modo Hockey
[
edit
]
Having grown up a Modo fan in
Kramfors
, Grahm joined the organisation in 2005 at the age of 14.
[5]
On 8 June 2011, it was announced that Grahm and Swedish national teammate,
Tina Enstrom
, would join the
University of Minnesota-Duluth
Bulldogs for the
2011-12 Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey season
.
[6]
However, she never attended UMD.
In July 2015, she became the first women's hockey player to be added to the database of the hockey statistics website Elite Prospects.
[7]
She missed the large parts of the 2015-16 SDHL season, including the entire playoffs, after suffering a series of injuries, including a pinched nerve at beginning of the season and breaking her foot in the latter half.
[8]
She was still able to put up 22 points in 29 games, as the club finished in 8th.
[9]
Off the ice, she held a job within the Modo organisation team office, including starting the MODO Women's Future programme, which organised practices for young girls in the region with Modo's professional women's players. For the
2017-18 SDHL season
, she took a year of leave from her job with Modo to focus on playing full-time.
[10]
Brynäs IF
[
edit
]
In June 2018, Grahm announced that she was leaving Modo to sign a two-year contract with
Brynäs IF Dam
which would include an off-ice position as a manager for the women's side and training towards becoming future Sports Manager for the whole organisation. The move came as Brynäs had begun a wide-ranging rebuild after suffering poor results and numerous player complaints in previous seasons.
[11]
She would be named team captain ahead of the
2018-19 SDHL season
.
In March 2020, after putting up 33 points in 33 games in the
2019-20 SDHL season
and leading the club to the semi-finals for the first time in seven years, she announced that she had extended her contract with the team by another two years.
[12]
International
[
edit
]
Grahm took part in the selection camp for the Swedish national team at the
2010 Winter Olympics
, but failed to make the team, being the last player cut from the roster. She would make her Olympic debut in
2014
, scoring 4 points in 6 games as Sweden finished in 4th, losing the bronze medal game to
Switzerland
. She would score 5 points in 6 games, including her first Olympic goal, at the
2018 Winter Olympics
, as Sweden finished in 7th.
An assistant captain for the Swedish national team and having made over 200 international appearances, Grahm was one of the leaders of the
2019 players' strike
over lack of compensation for international games and sub-standard conditions, including the decision by the Swedish Olympic Committee to cut all funding for the women's team and the team's first-ever relegation from the top IIHF division.
[13]
[14]
[15]
Personal life
[
edit
]
In 2011, Grahm faced a major health scare after becoming partially paralyzed as a result of
Guillain-Barré syndrome
.
[16]
After going through months of treatment and rehabilitation, she was able to make a healthy return to professional hockey. In 2014, she published a book about her experience called
From paralyzed to an Olympian
.

The
PDSA Dickin Medal
was instituted in 1943 in the United Kingdom by
Maria Dickin
to honour the work of animals in World War II. It is a bronze
medallion
, bearing the words "For Gallantry" and "We Also Serve" within a
laurel wreath

Victoria Cross
".
[1]
[2]
[3]
Maria Dickin was the founder of the
People's Dispensary for Sick Animals
(PDSA), a British
veterinary
charity.  She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with

pigeons
, 18
dogs
, 3
horses
, and a
ship's cat
- to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the

Marius Tucă
(born 29 July 1966, in
Caracal
,
Olt County
,
Romania
) is a Romanian journalist and TV host.
[1]
He distinguished himself in the 1990s as a political analyst and a TV host. He also contributed to the transformation of the
Jurnalul Naţional
newspaper into the best selling broadsheet in Romania. In 1997-1998, he hosted
Milionarii de la miezul nopţii
on
Antena 1
. After 1998, the show was named
Marius Tucă Show
. The TV show ceased in 2005. A short spell of the TV talk show in fall 2007 flopped and, as of 2008, he is again working exclusively only the newspaper. From 1 September 2020, after the new television station of Adrian Sârbu, Aleph News was launched, the show “Marius Tucă Show” returned, after a long break, with new topics, and new guests every night.

The
siege of Freiburg
took place between 9 and 16 November 1677, as part of the
Franco-Dutch War
, and ended with the conquest of the city by the French.
Prelude
[
edit
]
Towards the end of 1677 the warring factions withdrew to their winter quarters as usual. But French Marshal
François de Créquy
wrote to his King in Paris that he saw a good opportunity to take Freiburg and Louis XIV agreed to a winter action. On 8 November, Créquy surprisingly crossed the Rhine with his troops near
Breisach
, marched in the direction of Freiburg and reached the city by 8 AM on 9 November.
The commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army,
Charles of Lorraine
, quickly tried to remobilize his units, but it took a long time to get his scattered troops to the Breisgau over generally poor roads, and some contingents of the imperial districts could not be persuaded to continue the campaign of 1677.
The siege
[
edit
]
On 10 November, Créquy began shelling the suburb of
Neuburg
with artillery. At the same time
Meinhardt Schomberg
attacked the
Freiburg Charterhouse
towards the
Schlossberg
. During the night of 10/11 November, Colonel Kaunitz made a sally to disrupt the French in digging the trenches. On 11 November, Freiburg experienced a heavy cannonade, although the damage was limited. Kaunitz made another sortie to break up the enclosure and send messengers to the Duke of Lorraine. After the French artillery under the Marquis de Freselières had shot a breach of more than 30 meters wide in the city wall of Neuburg on 12 November, Créquy called on Freiburg to surrender. City commander Schütz refused because his officers advised against it. From 12/13 November, the French pushed the trenches further and widened the breach.
At 4 PM on 14 November, Schütz gave up the suburbs, although the French had not yet begun to storm the breach in the fortifications. The French occupied the suburbs and Créquy again called for surrender. Schütz seemed completely unable to act, which is why the Austrian government asked Count Portia to take over the command, but he refused. Meanwhile, the French were able to prepare undisturbed during the night their positions for the shelling of the inner ring of Freiburg's walls .
On 15 November, the French prepared to storm the Christopher Gate. At the same time, they managed to storm the ramparts on the Schlossberg and capture the fortifications on Karlseck. This enabled them to shoot at the defenders from above, and so Créquy had cannons brought to the highest point of the Schlossberg for an even more successful bombardment of the city. Later that day, the French made a breach in the Christopher Gate and the city commander signaled to the French that he wished to enter into surrender negotiations, after which a ceasefire ensued.
Créquy insisted that the town and castle had to be handed over by 8 AM on 16 November. After dark, gun fire was heard in Freiburg from the stronghold near
Emmendingen
, announcing the arrival of relief troops. During the night, messengers came from
Hermann of Baden-Baden
, who was approaching with an Imperial corps and who promised to be at Freiburg by the evening, at the latest.
As a consequence confusion reigned in Freiburg due to the disagreement between the city councillors, the Austrian government and the officers. But the city commander, Schütz, was determined to surrender and on 16 November, before 8 AM, the document of surrender was signed. The Austrian garrison was allowed to withdraw to
Rheinfelden
with their arms, while the French guaranteed life and property to the citizens. Irrespective of this, imperial and French troops plundered Freiburg. The withdrawal of the imperial units began at 1 PM. The main part of the French Army only moved into the city on 17 November.
Consequences
[
edit
]
When Charles of Lorraine heard of Freiburg's capitulation, he arranged for the arrest of the city commander, Schütz. Court-martialed in Vienna, he was acquitted, despite numerous indications that Schütz and possibly also members of the local nobility had worked into the hands of the French. Louis XIV was known for buying or blackmailing foreign princes and their officials. General Schütz's acquittal was attributed to the influence of the Freiburg-born Viennese court chancellor,
Johann Paul Hocher
, who was related to Schütz.
In France, the capture of Freiburg was celebrated as a great victory and a commemorative coin was minted for this event.
The French converted the city into a fortress by Vauban, for which several suburbs were demolished.
In the
Peace of Nijmegen
, the Habsburgs gave up Freiburg, which remained French until 1698.

Donald Haines
(May 9, 1919 - February 20, 1943) was an American
child actor
who had recurring appearances in the
Our Gang
short subjects
series from 1930 to 1933. He appeared in
Our Gang
during the early sound days along with
Norman "Chubby" Chaney
,
Allen "Farina" Hoskins
,
Jackie Cooper
,
Matthew "Stymie" Beard
,
Bobby "Wheezer" Hutchins
, and
Dorothy DeBorba
.
Early years
[
edit
]
Haines was born in
Seward County, Nebraska
, the son of Karl and Nola Haines. Their family moved to California when he was 9 years old.
[1]
Our Gang
[
edit
]
Haines's tenure began during the early talkies up through the "Miss Crabtree episodes," and then the early Spanky episodes. He would leave with
Jackie Cooper
for feature films at Paramount only to return a few months later. He was 11 years old when he joined the gang in 1930. His association with the Our Gang series lasted through 1933.
[

Haines's first short was
Shivering Shakespeare
, which featured him giggling his way through his lines. He was intended to originally be a full-time character playing the tough guy and was cast as such in
The First Seven Years
, opposite
Jackie Cooper
. After that, he played a recurring character with occasional lines of dialogue until 1931. At that time he was offered a contract with
Paramount
that began with a role in a feature called
Skippy
. Cooper also was offered a role on that feature along with a contract. Both Jackie and Donald are missing from the final scenes of the second-to-last short made in the 1930-31 season,
Bargain Day
, owing to their beginning work at Paramount.
Haines left Paramount to return to Hal Roach Studios just in time for the 1931-32 season. Haines would resume his role as a recurring character with occasional dialogue for the next two seasons. Haines left the
Our Gang
series at the age of 15 after appearing in the 1933 short
Fish Hooky
.
Later career
[
edit
]
Haines left the
Our Gang
series in 1933 but continued working as an actor at Hal Roach Studios on many shorts and features until 1940. His work during this time included appearances in the East Side Kids films
East Side Kids
and
Boys of the City
as "Pee Wee" and then in
That Gang of Mine
,
Pride of the Bowery
,
Flying Wild
,
Bowery Blitzkrieg
, and
Spooks Run Wild
as "Skinny." He also played Jerry Cruncher Jr. in the film version of
A Tale of Two Cities
.
Death
[
edit
]
Haines enlisted as an aviation cadet in the
United States Army Air Forces
on December 10, 1941, to serve in
World War II
.
[1]
He was
killed in action
on February 20, 1943, in North Africa. At the time of his death, he was a
first lieutenant
in the
93rd Fighter Squadron
. Haines is buried in
Inglewood Park Cemetery
in Los Angeles.

Monroe
is a city in
Sevier County
,
Utah
, United States. The population was 2,256 at the
2010 United States Census
.
Geography
[
edit
]
Monroe is located in rural central Utah. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.5 square miles (9.2 km
2
), all land. Monroe is bordered by mountains on the east and south, and farmers' fields to the west and north.
Monroe is home to naturally occurring
hot springs
with
travertine
deposits, a result of the Monroe-Red Hill
geothermal
system found along the Sevier
fault
.
[5]
On the east side of town, hot water surfaces at a temperature of 168 °F and a rate of about 200 gallons per minute. A travertine mound has formed, known as the Monroe Mound. This deposit stretches one mile across, 200 yards wide, and a few hundred feet thick. There is another hot water source about a mile north of town called the Red Hill Hot Springs. It also surfaces at 168 °F, but at a rate of about 100 gallons per minute. The Red Hill mound is about one-third of a mile across, and deep red in color.

History
[
edit
]
In late 1863, a few exploratory settlers came to Monroe. This small group included George Wilson, his son David, and two others who were seeking to settle in this valley. They made a dugout and spent the winter at what is now considered near the center of the town. They were followed by the first permanent group of settlers, who arrived in Monroe on 20 February 1864.
[7]
Most, if not all, of the first Settlers were members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(LDS Church), who had immigrated to Utah. Around 4 to 5 months before the first small group of men entered Monroe valley to begin settlement, an advanced team, also led by George Wilson, began to lay some foundation work to help prepare the settlement.
[7]
At first the town was called South Bend (due to the proximity to a bend in the
Sevier River
), but soon after its settlement it was renamed Alma, in honor of the Book of Mormon prophet.  It is estimated that by the end of 1864 around 20 families were living in Alma. They spent the first year building small homes and
dugouts
, along with clearing space for fields and pastures.
[8]
Initially settling in the
Salt Lake Valley
did not provoke the Native Americans to war, but further settlement outside of Salt Lake provoked the Native Americans to more aggressive behavior. As settlement in these valleys increased, the Native Americans were pushed back into the mountains.
[7]
In April 1865, the
Black Hawk War
broke out between local Native Americans and the Settlers of both the Sevier and Sanpete counties. The war drastically ended the progress which was being made in creating farms and homes in and around Alma.
[8]
On the night of 21 April 1866, Walter Barney and Sidney Robinson were on guard watching the public corral when they spotted something lying on the fence when making their nightly rounds. When approached, they realized that it was two Native Americans. After chasing them away, they went back to the fence and realized that they had been digging around the poles to break the boundary around the corral.
[7]
Alma had been settled in the middle of the Native Americans’ hunting grounds and as a result they started to go hungry. During the war Native Americans were constantly trying to steal the Settler's stock for food, and they were successful during several raids.
An artist's interpretation of what Fort Alma may have looked like.
Sometime during 1865, work began on a fort to provide protection for both the Settlers and their stock. The fort was completed and contained several homes, a
blacksmith
shop, along with a corral and stockyard for the animals. This fort, named Fort Alma, provided protection for about two years, but things continued to get more dangerous and in April 1867 the Settlers of Alma were evacuated. Most of the evacuees made temporary homes in Sanpete County, until they could return home.
An attempt to resettle Alma was made during 1868, but the Settlers ran into Native Americans near Cedar Ridge (now Vermillion, Utah) and a battle ensued. They were unsuccessful in resettling Alma, and it was not until March 1871 that Settlers were finally able to return to Alma.  The following year they applied for a Post Office under the city name of Monroe, in honor of U.S. President
James Monroe
. By the end of 1872 the
telegraph
had been extended through Monroe, which connected it with the rest of Utah. In 1889, Monroe was incorporated as a town and remained that way until 1921, when it was incorporated as a city.
[8]
In 1882, Thomas Cooper and his wife homesteaded the area on the east side of town where hot springs water emerged. They built a wood box to collect the water and offered it as a soaking pool. Later, around 1905, a building was erected. There was a dance floor, an indoor swimming pool, and many dressing rooms. Many people came from miles around by horse and buggy to enjoy soaking and dancing. In 1930 Farnsworth bought the hot springs.  He was the leader of a band, and it became the house band. The slogan for the Monroe hot springs was, "the home of mirth and merriment".
[9]
The hot springs enjoyed many years of prosperity until around 1950. It was revitalized in the 1970s. The name was changed to Mystic Hot Springs in 1995.

First voyage
[
edit
]
Ringrose crossed the
Isthmus of Darien
in 1680 with a group of pirates.
[2]
On this trip he created extensive charts of the islands, soundings, exhaustive nautical instruction and symbols to mark rocks and shallow water.
[3]
Fluent in Latin and French, he quickly learned Spanish to act as an interpreter.
[4]
[5]
Captain
Bartholomew Sharp
,
Lionel Wafer
,
John Coxon
,
Edmund Cooke
, William Dick and
William Dampier
were also crew members. Dampier refers to Ringrose as an apprentice to a planter in Jamaica. At the end of the voyage, Ringrose and several crewmates took the maps and charts to Dartmouth to sell.
[6]
Second voyage
[
edit
]
In October 1683, Ringrose sailed on the Cygnet with Captain Swan, as the Supercargo.
[2]
Damper writes "He had no mind for this voyage, but was necessitated to engage in it or starve."
[4]
On the Mexican coast in Santa Pecaque, the crew looted the village. Capt. Swan sent 54 men with laden horses back to the anchorage, Ringrose among them. They were set upon by Spanish soldiers and massacred.
[7]
[8]
Ringrose's journal gives an account of the early part of this trip.
[9]
It is now in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich in England. His maps and charts have become "A Buccaneer’s Atlas" by William Hach, a noted cartographer in London of the time.

History
[
edit
]
Under the 1912 Straits Settlements Port Ordinance, the Singapore Harbour Board was formed on 1 July 1913.
[2]
On 1 April 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority came into being under the 1963 Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance to replace the Singapore Harbour Board and several organisations that have been operating in the port.
[3]
In the 1970s, PSA started building a container port in Singapore, and in 1972, handled their first container ship. A decade later, they reached the milestone of one-million-TEU of number of containers processed. They later reached the 5 million TEU mark by 1990, making Singapore at the time as the world’s largest container port. The company became a global operator after it first started its global expansion in 1966 through port interests in
Dalian
, China.
[4]
[5]
A parliamentary bill was passed on 25 August 1997, to turn the Port of Singapore Authority, a state organisation into an independent commercial company. PSA Corporation Limited was thus corporatised on 1 October 1997. The company kept the initials “PSA” as its brand name but it is no longer an acronym. The regulatory functions of the former authority were transferred to Singapore's new maritime regulator, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).
In order to focus on its core port business, PSA Corporation set up The HarbourFront Limited (present day
Mapletree
) on 7 December 2000, to spearhead development of its properties.
[6]
Following a restructuring exercise in December 2003, PSA International Pte Ltd became the holding company for the PSA Group of companies.
in March 2022, it was announced by PSA International and
Halifax Port Authority
that PSA has acquired the Fairview Cove Container Terminal (Ceres Halifax Inc.) from
Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha
.
[7]
PSA Marine
[

PSA Marine Pte Ltd
, a wholly owned subsidiary of PSA International, provides marine services to the maritime and shipping community. They include pilotage and port and terminal towage. PSA Marine owns and operates a fleet of over 80 vessels in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, mainland China, India, Australia and Oman.

Abaqus FEA
[4]
[5]
(formerly
ABAQUS
) is a software suite for
finite element analysis
and
computer-aided engineering
, originally released in 1978. The name and logo of this software are based on the
abacus
calculation tool.
[6]
The Abaqus product suite consists of five core software products:
[5]
Abaqus/CAE
, or "
C
omplete
A
baqus
E
nvironment" (a
backronym
with a root in
C
omputer-
A
ided
E
ngineering
[7]
). It is a software application used for both the modeling and analysis of mechanical components and assemblies (pre-processing) and visualizing the finite element analysis result. A subset of Abaqus/CAE including only the post-processing module can be launched independently in the
Abaqus/Viewer
product.
Abaqus/Standard
, a general-purpose Finite-Element analyzer that employs implicit integration scheme (traditional).
Abaqus/Explicit
, a special-purpose Finite-Element analyzer that employs explicit integration scheme to solve highly nonlinear systems with many complex contacts under transient loads.
Abaqus/CFD
, a
C
omputational
F
luid
D
ynamics
software application which provides advanced computational fluid dynamics capabilities with extensive support for preprocessing and postprocessing provided in Abaqus/CAE - discontinued in Abaqus 2017 and further releases.
[8]
Abaqus/Electromagnetic
, a
Computational electromagnetics
software application which solves advanced computational electromagnetic problems.
The Abaqus products use the
open-source
scripting language
Python
for scripting and customization. Abaqus/CAE uses the
fox-toolkit
for
GUI
development.
History
[
edit
]
The name of Abaqus was initially written as ABAQUS when it was first released. The early history of ABAQUS is very tightly connected with the early history of
MARC Analysis Research Corporation
.
[9]
Dr.
David Hibbitt
, Dr. Bengt Karlsson, and Dr. Paul Sorensen co-founded the company later known as Hibbitt, Karlsson & Sorensen, Inc., (HKS) in Jan, 1978 to develop and market ABAQUS software. Hibbitt and Sorensen had met while completing their Ph.Ds at Brown University while Karlsson encountered the two in his capacity as a support analyst in a data centre in Stockholm.

ABAQUS version 1 was created for a specific client --
Westinghouse Hanford Company
which used the software to analyze nuclear fuel rod assemblies. ABAQUS version 3 was released in June 1979.
[13]
In the early days, ABAQUS was designed primarily for the nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of structures, and nonlinear steady and transient analysis of heat transfer or conduction problems.
[13]
It was initially distributed via CDC's Cybernet service. The first parallel version of ABAQUS, version 5.4, was made available to users in 1995.
[11]
The core product, eventually known as ABAQUS/Standard which is an implicit finite element solver, was complemented by other software packages including ABAQUS/Explicit, a dynamic explicit analysis package released in 1992, and ABAQUS/CAE, a finite element pre- and post-processing package released in 1999. The first official release of ABAQUS/Explicit was hand-delivered to
M.I.T.
in 1992.
[12]
Later on, the company's name was changed to
ABAQUS, Inc.
in late 2002 to reflect the company's focus on this product line. Then, in October 2005, the company with its 525 employees was acquired by
Dassault Systèmes
for $413 million or about four times the company's annual revenue of approximately $100 million.
[9]
[14]
[15]
After that,
ABAQUS, Inc.
became part of
Dassault Systèmes Simulia Corp
.
Dr. David Hibbitt was still with the company he co-founded as chairman while Mark Goldstein was president and CEO when the company was acquired by Dassault Systèmes. After 23 years of leadership, David Hibbitt retired in 2001; Bengt Karlsson and Paul Sorensen followed suit in the following year. All three are still living in New England.
[12]
The headquarters of the company was located in Providence, Rhode Island until 2014. Since 2014, the headquarters of the company are located in Johnston, Rhode Island, United States.
Release history
[
edit
]
The first version of ABAQUS was delivered/released in Sept. 1978.
[10]
Version 3 of ABAQUS was released in June 1979.
[13]
The first official release of ABAQUS/Explicit was in 1992.
[12]
Version 0 of ABAQUS/Viewer was released as a standalone product in 1998. The same features were made available as the Visualization module of ABAQUS/CAE when it was first released in 1999.

Applications
[
edit
]
Abaqus is used in the
automotive
,
aerospace
, and industrial products in industries. The product is popular with non-academic and research institutions in engineering due to the wide material modeling capability, and the program's ability to be customized, for example, users can define their own material models so that new materials could also be simulated in Abaqus.  Abaqus also provides a good collection of
multiphysics
capabilities, such as coupled acoustic-structural,
piezoelectric
, and structural-pore capabilities, making it attractive for production-level simulations where multiple fields need to be coupled.
Abaqus was initially designed to address non-linear physical behavior; as a result, the package has an extensive range of material models such as
elastomeric
(rubberlike) and hyperelastic (
soft tissue
) material capabilities.
Here are some animated examples
Solution Sequence
[
edit
]
Abaqus FEA
software products used in Finite Element Analysis and their order of use.
Every complete finite-element analysis consists of 3 separate stages:
Pre-processing
or
modeling
: This stage involves creating an input file which contains an engineer's design for a finite-element analyzer (also called "solver").
Processing
or
finite element analysis
: This stage produces an output visual file.
Post-processing
or generating report, image, animation, etc. from the output file: This stage is a visual rendering stage.
Abaqus/CAE is capable of pre-processing, post-processing, and monitoring the processing stage of the solver; however, the first stage can also be done by other compatible CAD software, or even a text editor. Abaqus/Standard, Abaqus/Explicit or Abaqus/CFD are capable of accomplishing the processing stage. Dassault Systemes also produces
Abaqus for CATIA
for adding advanced processing and post processing stages to a pre-processor like CATIA.
Solvers Comparison

Notes
The more complex the contacts become, the more repetitive calculations ABAQUS/Standard has to solve, and the more time and disk space needed; ABAQUS Explicit is the optimal choice in this case
Like static elements (see the picture,) dynamic elements, thermal elements and electrical elements
Steady, Static and Constant loads are the same. Transient loads include: quasi-static loads (slowly varying loads in which the effect of inertial is small enough to neglect) and dynamic loads (faster varying loads).

Douglas Northrop Jackson II
FRSC
(August 14, 1929 - August 22, 2004) was a Canadian
psychology
professor best known for his work in human assessment and psychological testing.
Life and career
[
edit
]
Born in
Merrick, New York
, Jackson graduated from
Cornell University
in 1951 with a BSc in
Industrial and Labor Relations
and from
Purdue University
in 1955 with a PhD in Clinical Psychology. Jackson taught at
Pennsylvania State University
(1956-62) and
Stanford University
(1962-64) before starting at
University of Western Ontario
in 1964, where he taught for over 32 years.
[1]
Jackson created numerous tests in his life, including:
Multidimensional Aptitude Battery
(MAB)
Personality Research Form (PRF)
Jackson Vocational Interest Survey
(JVIS)
Employee Screening Questionnaire (ESQ)
These were distributed through two companies he founded, Research Psychologists Press and Sigma Assessment Systems.
He collaborated with
Samuel Messick
at the
Educational Testing Service
, examining
construct validity
. Jackson also published several analyses on
sex and intelligence
that found males applying to medical schools had a small but nontrivial advantage in
general intelligence factor
and in reasoning.
[2]
[3]
Jackson served on the Executive Council of the
International Test Commission
and was a Fellow of the
Royal Society of Canada
(1989). He was president of the Society of Multivariate Experimental Research from 1975-1976 and received their Saul Sells Award for Lifetime Contributions in 1997. He was President of
APA
's Division of Measurement, Evaluation, and Statistics from 1989-1990 and was awarded that division's Samuel J. Messick Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions in 2004.
In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "
Mainstream Science on Intelligence
," an editorial written by
Linda Gottfredson
and published in
The Wall Street Journal
, which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to the controversy about intelligence research that followed the publication of the book
The Bell Curve
.
[4]
Colleague
J. Philippe Rushton
noted that Jackson's founding of Canada's
Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship
was a response to "Canadian researchers challenged by '
political correctness
'" and "demonstrated his personal commitment to ensuring personal liberty and freedom of enquiry for his colleagues."

The
Information Security Automation Program
(
ISAP
, pronounced “I Sap”) is a U.S. government multi-agency initiative to enable automation and standardization of technical security operations. While a U.S. government initiative, its standards based design can benefit all information technology security operations. The ISAP high level goals include standards based automation of security checking and remediation as well as automation of technical compliance activities (e.g.
FISMA
). ISAP's low level objectives include enabling standards based communication of vulnerability data, customizing and managing configuration baselines for various IT products, assessing information systems and reporting compliance status, using standard metrics to weight and aggregate potential vulnerability impact, and remediating identified vulnerabilities.
ISAP's technical specifications are contained in the related
Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP). ISAP's security automation content is either contained within, or referenced by, the
National Vulnerability Database
.
ISAP is being formalized through a trilateral memorandum of agreement (MOA) between
Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA), the
National Security Agency
(NSA), and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST).  The
Office of the Secretary of Defense
(OSD) also participates and the
Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) funds the operation infrastructure on which ISAP relies (i.e., the National Vulnerability Database).

Lagidium ahuacaense
is a
rodent
in the
mountain viscacha
genus (
Lagidium
) that occurs in southern
Ecuador
. First observed in 2005 and formally described in 2009, it occurs more than 500 km (310 mi) north of the nearest previously known population of mountain viscachas in central
Peru
. Only a single population is known, found on rocky habitats on Cerro El Ahuaca, an isolated granite mountain in southern Ecuador, and as few as several dozen individuals remain. The species is threatened by fires and grazing cattle, and the discoverers recommended its
conservation status
be assessed as
critically endangered
.
Taxonomy
[
edit
]
L. ahuacaense
was first observed in July 2005, when the only known population was encountered at Cerro El Ahuaca, Ecuador,
[1]
over 500 km (310 mi) north of the northernmost previously known population of
mountain viscachas
(
Lagidium
) in central Peru.
[2]
The find was published in a 2006 note by Florian Werner, Karim Ledesma, and Rodrigo Hidalgo, who provisionally identified the population as representing the Peruvian species
Lagidium peruanum
, but did not discount the possibility that it might represent a distinct species.
[1]
Three years later, Ledesma, Werner, Ángel Spotorno, and Luis Albuja described the population as a new species,
Lagidium ahuacaense
, on the basis of
morphological
and
DNA sequence
differences.
[3]
The
specific name
,
ahuacaense
, refers to Cerro de Ahuaca. They suggested the English
common name
of "Ecuadorean mountain viscacha".
[4]
L. ahuacaense
was the fourth species of the genus
Lagidium
to be described, after
L. peruanum
,
L. viscacia
, and
L. wolffsohni
of the central and southern Andes, although more species may eventually be recognized within
L. peruanum
and
L. viscacia
, and
L. wolffsohni
is poorly differentiated from
L. viscacia
.
[5]
Together with the
plains viscacha
(
Lagostomus maximus
) and the
chinchillas
(
Chinchilla
),
Lagidium
forms the
rodent
family
Chinchillidae
.
[2]
Within
Lagidium
,
L. ahuacaense
differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in DNA sequences of the
mitochondrial
cytochrome
b
gene. A
cladistic
analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the
sister group
to all other
Lagidium
species, but support for this placement was not strong.
Morphometric
analysis also confirmed the Ecuadorian population is different from other
Lagidium
species.
[6]
Description
[
edit
]
A
northern viscacha
(
Lagidium peruanum
), the species that occurs closest to
L. ahuacaense
L. ahuacaense
is medium-sized with woolly, gray-brown fur
[7]
and a very long tail.
[6]
A black stripe runs along the middle of the back. The thick, long mystacial
vibrissae
(whiskers above the mouth) are mostly dark brown and the few superciliary vibrissae (above the eyes) are also thick and brown. The ears are covered with dark skin. The underparts are creamy white. The fore feet are brown-furred and much shorter than the hind feet, which are in covered in part by a mixture of brown and cream hairs and in part by dark brown hairs. The fore and hind feet both have four digits, which end in small, curved claws, and three black
pads
.
[7]
The palms and soles are naked.
[4]
The tail is hairy with the hairs on the upper side are longer than those below. The upper side is gray-brown at the base, light to medium brown intermixed with cream in the middle, and reddish-brown at the tip, and the lower side is dark brown.
[7]
In the single measured specimen, head and body length is 403 mm (15.9 in), tail length is 400 mm (16 in), hind foot length is 85 mm (3.3 in), ear length is 60 mm (2.4 in), and body mass is 2.03 kg (4.5 lb).
[8]
The skull is long and compact. The
premaxillary
bones extend slightly in front of the upper
incisors
and the
zygomatic arches
(cheekbones) are broad. The
suture
between the premaxillary and
frontal bones
is more strongly curved than in
L. peruanum
and the rostrum (front part of the skull) is wider and the
interorbital region
is narrower than in
L. viscacia
and
L. wolffsohni
.
[7]
The
incisive foramina
(openings in the front part of the
palate
) are long and narrow. The palate extends back to a point close to the upper third
molar
.
[9]
The sides of the mesopterygoid fossa (the opening behind the back margin of the palate) are more strongly divergent than in other
Lagidium
species.
[7]
The
mandible
is strong. The
dental formula
is
1.0.1.3
1.0.1.3
× 2 = 20
(one incisor, one
premolar
, and three molars on each side of the upper and lower jaws). The incisors are large, white, and distinctly grooved. The molars are low-crowned and rootless (continuously growing).
[9]
Ecology and conservation status
[
edit
]
L. ahuacaense
is known only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite
inselberg
near
Cariamanga
in
Loja Province
, southern Ecuador, where it occurs at an altitude of 1,950 to 2,480 m (6,400 to 8,140 ft), but only near rocky surfaces.
[4]
The vegetation is dominated by the molasses grass (
Melinis minutiflora
).
[10]
They eat plants, and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain.
[11]
Their habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area around 120 ha (300 acres), and the total population there may not contain more than a few dozen individuals.
[12]
Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, no nearby habitat is suitable,
[13]
but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.
[12]
The species is threatened by fires, used to maintain crop fields in the vicinity, which frequently get out of control and destroy part of the viscacha's habitat on the Cerro, and by competition for food with grazing cattle. However, the species is unknown to the local people and is not hunted.
[1]
In view of its small range and population, Ledesma and colleagues recommended the species be assessed as critically endangered under the
IUCN Red List
criteria and recommended immediate conservation action to protect the Cerro El Ahuaca population and further research into its biology.

Teramoto Asuka
(
寺本 明日香
,
born 19 November 1995
)
is a Japanese gymnast.
[2]
Teramoto was born in
Komaki, Aichi
. Her first major international senior competition was the
2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships
in
Tokyo
, Japan. In the team all-around finals, she contributed on vaulting, uneven bars, and balance beam towards the Japanese team's 7th-place finish. She also qualified for the uneven bars final in 8th place. She ended up finishing in a tie for 5th with
Gabrielle Douglas
, finishing ahead of teammate
Tsurumi Kōko
. That event was won by
Viktoria Komova
of Russia.
She competed for the national team at the
2012 Summer Olympics
in the
Women's artistic team all-around
. Teramoto also qualified 8th for the
individual all-around
, as well as being named a reserve for both the balance beam and floor exercise finals. She ended up placing 11th in the all-around final. She was the smallest and lightest competitor, at 1.36 m (4 ft 6 in) tall and weighing 30 kg (66 lb), of all those at the Games.
[3]
In October 2013, Teramoto competed at the
2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships
in
Antwerp, Belgium
. After a mediocre qualification competition, she managed to qualify for the individual all-around final in 23rd place. She did much better in the final, finishing in 9th, ahead of teammate
Natsumi Sasada
, who finished in 23rd. That final was won by
Simone Biles
of the United States. Teramoto also competed at a World Cup event in
Glasgow
, finishing 4th in the women's individual all-around, which was won by
Larisa Iordache
of Romania.
[4]
At the 2014
Japanese National Championships
, Teramoto became the uneven bars champion, as well as the all-around silver medalist behind
Natsumi Sasada
and vault bronze medalist behind
Sae Miyakawa
and
Mai Murakami
. Due to her results, Teramoto was named to Japan's
2014 World Championships
team that competed in
Nanning
and placed eighth in the team final. Individually, she qualified to the balance beam final where she narrowly missed out on the bronze medal, placing just 0.066 points behind
Aliya Mustafina
of Russia.
Simone Biles
of the United States went on to win the gold medal and
Bai Yawen
of China earned the silver.
At the 2015 Universiade, she placed second in the all-around and the uneven bars.
Teramoto began the 2016 season at the Glasgow World Cup, finishing 4th in the All-Around. She continued her season at the 2016 All-Japan National Championships, the first step to qualify to the
2016 Olympic team
. Teramoto won the silver medal in the All-Around behind
Mai Murakami
, also winning the national title on balance beam. At the second qualifying event, the NHK Trophy, Teramoto won the All-Around Title, ahead of Mai Murakami and
Aiko Sugihara
. With this win, Teramoto secured a berth onto the Olympic team.
[5]
At the Olympic Games, she missed event finals, but she did manage to qualify for the team and individual all around finals. In the team finals, she helped her team place 4th, their best finish since the 1964 Olympic Games. In the individual all-around final, she once again delivered solid performances, placing a personal best finish of 8th in the all around.

Early life (1942-1965)
Main article:
Early life and career of Joe Biden
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,
[2]
at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,
[3]
to Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.
[4]
[5]
The oldest child in a
Catholic
family of largely Irish descent, he has a sister,
Valerie
, and two brothers, Francis and James.
[6]
Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of
Garden City
in the fall of 1946,
[7]
but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,
[8]
[9]
[10]
and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.
[11]
Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.
[12]
Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,
[13]
the family lived in an apartment in
Claymont, Delaware
, before moving to a house in nearby
Mayfield
.
[14]
[15]
[9]
[11]
Biden Sr. later became a successful
used-car salesman
, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.
[11]
[12]
[16]
At
Archmere Academy
in Claymont,
[17]
Biden played baseball and was a standout
halfback
and
wide receiver
on the
high school football
team.
[11]
[18]
Though a poor student, he was
class president
in his junior and senior years.
[19]
[20]
He graduated in 1961.
[19]
At the
University of Delaware
in
Newark
, Biden briefly played freshman football,
[21]
[22]
and, as an unexceptional student,
[23]
earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a
double major
in history and
political science
.
[24]
[25]
Biden had a
stutter
, and has mitigated it since his early twenties.
[26]
He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.
[20]
[27]
Marriages, law school, and early career (1966-1973)
Main article:
Early career of Joe Biden
See also:
Family of Joe Biden
On August 27, 1966, Biden married
Neilia Hunter
, a student at
Syracuse University
,
[24]
[28]
after overcoming her parents' reluctance for her to wed a
Roman Catholic
. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in
Skaneateles, New York
.
[29]
They had three children:
Joseph R. "Beau" Biden III
,
Robert Hunter Biden
, and Naomi Christina "Amy" Biden.
[24]
Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook
In 1968, Biden earned a
Juris Doctor
from
Syracuse University College of Law
, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged "mistake" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.
[23]
He was
admitted
to the
Delaware bar
in 1969.
[2]
In 1968, Biden clerked at a
Wilmington
law firm headed by prominent local
Republican
William Prickett and, he later said, "thought of myself as a Republican".
[30]
[31]
He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor
Charles L. Terry
's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican,
Russell W. Peterson
, who defeated Terry in 1968.
[30]
Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an
Independent
because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate
Richard Nixon
.
[30]
In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a
public defender
and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat
[32]
[30]
who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;
[33]
Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.
[30]
He and another attorney also formed a law firm.
[32]
Corporate law
did not appeal to him, and
criminal law
did not pay well.
[11]
He supplemented his income by managing properties.
[34]
In 1970, Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the
New Castle County Council
on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.
[35]
[36]
The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.
[37]
[38]
[39]
Biden won the general election by defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.
[40]
[41]
He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.
[42]
[43]
During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.
[43]
Biden had not openly supported or opposed the
Vietnam War
until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.
[44]
While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments, at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. In 1968, based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had "asthma as a teenager" was the reason for the deferment.
[45]
1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware
Main article:
1972 United States Senate election in Delaware
In 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent
J. Caleb Boggs
to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs, and with minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning.
[32]
[11]
Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,
[46]
an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.
[34]
He received help from the
AFL-CIO
and Democratic pollster
Patrick Caddell
.
[32]
His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with "politics as usual".
[32]
[46]
A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,
[32]
but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,
[16]
and he won with 50.5% of the vote.
[46]
Death of wife and daughter
On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in
Hockessin, Delaware
.
[24]
[47]
Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged
3) and Hunter (aged
2) were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.
[48]
Biden considered resigning to care for them,
[16]
but
Senate Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield
persuaded him not to.
[49]
The accident filled Biden with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he "felt God had played a horrible trick" on him,
[50]
and he had trouble focusing on work.
[51]
[52]
Police never filed charges against the truck driver, determining that it was Neilia who did not see the oncoming truck as she pulled out of the intersection, possibly due to visibility issues.
[53]
[54]
However, Biden later said on several occasions that the truck driver had been drinking alcohol before the collision,
[55]
and several media outlets reported this as fact.
[56]
The driver died in 1999, but his daughter sought to have his name again cleared and to get an apology from Biden.
[54]
The chief prosecutor who investigated the case said there was no evidence of drunk driving.
[54]
Subsequently, a Biden spokesperson said that Biden "fully accepts the [driver's] family's word that these rumors were false".
[56]
Biden called the driver's daughter to apologize, and she accepted his apology.
[57]
Second marriage
Biden and his second wife,
Jill
, met in 1975 and married in 1977.
Biden met the teacher
Jill Tracy Jacobs
in 1975 on a
blind date
.
[58]
They married at the
United Nations chapel
in New York on June 17, 1977.
[59]
[60]
They spent their honeymoon at
Lake Balaton
in the
Hungarian People's Republic
.
[61]
[62]
Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.
[63]
Biden is Roman Catholic and attends Mass with his wife, Jill, at
St. Joseph's on the Brandywine
in
Greenville, Delaware
.
[64]
[65]
[66]
Their daughter,
Ashley Biden
,
[24]
is a social worker, and is married to physician
Howard Krein
.
[67]
Beau Biden became an Army
Judge Advocate
in Iraq and later
Delaware Attorney General
[68]
before dying of brain cancer in 2015.
[69]
[70]
Hunter Biden worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings and personal life came under
significant scrutiny
during his father's presidency.
[71]
[72]
Teaching
From 1991 to 2008, as an
adjunct professor
, Biden co-taught a
seminar
on
constitutional law
at
Widener University School of Law
.
[73]
[74]
The seminar often had a waiting list. Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.

Francis R. Valeo
swore Biden in at the
Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center
.
[79]
[48]
Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.
[79]
[48]
At 30, he was the
seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history
.
[80]
To see his sons, Biden traveled by
train
between his Delaware home and D.C.
[81]
—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.
[16]
Elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in
1978
,
1984
,
1990
,
1996
,
2002
, and
2008
, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.
[82]
He was junior senator to
William Roth
, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.
[83]
As of 2023
, he was the
19th-longest-serving senator
in U.S. history.
[84]
During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.
[85]
In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and
military conscription
.
[86]
Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse
Jimmy Carter
for president in the
1976 Democratic primary
.
[87]
Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President
Gerald Ford
in the
1976 election
. Biden also worked on
arms control
.
[88]
[89]
After Congress failed to ratify the
SALT II
Treaty signed in 1979 by
Soviet General Secretary
Leonid Brezhnev
and President
Jimmy Carter
, Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko
to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.
[90]
He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State
George Shultz
at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of
apartheid
.
[30]
In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of
race-integration busing
. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.
[91]
In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy
de jure
segregation
, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy
de facto
segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.
[92]
In 1976, Biden supported a measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.
[91]
In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.
[93]
Biden shaking hands with President
Ronald Reagan
, 1984
Biden became
ranking minority member
of the
Senate Judiciary Committee
in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the
Comprehensive Crime Control Act
. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.
[94]
In 1994, Biden helped pass the
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
, which included
a ban on assault weapons
,
[95]
[96]
and the
Violence Against Women Act
,
[97]
which he has called his most significant legislation.
[98]
The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;
[99]
[100]
in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a "big mistake", citing its policy on
crack cocaine
and saying that the bill "trapped an entire generation".
[101]
In 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces.
[102]
[103]
In 1996, he voted for the
Defense of Marriage Act
, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.
[104]
In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in
Obergefell v. Hodges
.
[105]
Biden was critical of
Independent Counsel
Ken Starr
during the 1990s
Whitewater controversy
and
Lewinsky scandal
investigations, saying "it's going to be a cold day in hell" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.
[106]
He voted to acquit during the
impeachment of President Clinton
.
[107]
During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.
[16]
Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act
,
[16]
with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.
[108]
As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased
Amtrak
funding and rail security.
[82]
[109]
Brain surgeries
In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by ambulance to
Walter Reed Army Medical Center
for surgery to correct a leaking
intracranial berry aneurysm
.
[110]
[111]
While recuperating, he suffered a
pulmonary embolism
, a serious complication.
[111]
After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,
[111]
[112]
Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.
[113]
Senate Judiciary Committee
Biden speaking at the signing of the
1994 Crime Bill
with President
Bill Clinton
in 1994
Biden was a longtime member of the
Senate Committee on the Judiciary
. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a
ranking minority member
from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.
[114]
As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious
U.S. Supreme Court
confirmation hearings.
[16]
When
Robert Bork was nominated
in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌ given in an interview the previous year‍—‌ of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,
[115]
but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.
[115]
[116]
Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,
[16]
Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong
originalism
and the view that the
U.S. Constitution
provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.
[116]
Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5-9 vote
[116]
and then in the full Senate, 42-58.
[117]
During
Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings
in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,
[118]
and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to "
beanballs
".
[119]
After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that
Anita Hill
, a
University of Oklahoma
law school professor, had accused Thomas of
making unwelcome sexual comments
when they had worked together.
[120]
[121]
Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.
[16]
The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.
[122]
The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52-48 vote, with Biden opposed.
[16]
Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.
[122]
In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.
[123]
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, December 1997.
Biden was a longtime member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.
[124]
His positions were generally
liberal internationalist
.
[88]
[125]
He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.
[124]
[125]
During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.
[126]
Biden voted against authorization for the
Gulf War
in 1991,
[125]
siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the
anti-Iraq coalition
.
[127]
Biden became interested in the
Yugoslav Wars
after hearing about
Serbian
abuses during the
Croatian War of Independence
in 1991.
[88]
Once the
Bosnian War
broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the "
lift and strike
" policy.
[88]
[124]
The
George H. W. Bush administration
and
Clinton administration
were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing
Balkan
entanglement.
[88]
[125]
In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader
Slobodan Milošević
.
[128]
Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.
[128]
Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his "proudest moment in public life" related to foreign policy.
[125]
In 1999, during the
Kosovo War
, Biden supported the
1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia
.
[88]
He and Senator
John McCain
co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over
Yugoslav
actions toward
ethnic Albanians
in
Kosovo
.

[129]
Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
Main article:
War on terror
Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister
Ayad Allawi
in
Baghdad
in 2004.
Biden was a strong supporter of the
War in Afghanistan
, saying, "Whatever it takes, we should do it."
[130]
As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein
was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to "eliminate" that threat.
[131]
In October 2002, he voted in favor of the
Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq
, approving the
U.S. Invasion of Iraq
.
[125]
As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of
al-Qaeda
, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of
Weapons of Mass Destruction
.
[132]
Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a "mistake", but did not push for withdrawal.
[125]
[128]
He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about its cost and length.
[124]
[129]
By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the
troop surge of 2007
,
[125]
[128]
saying General
David Petraeus
was "dead, flat wrong" in believing the surge could work.
[133]
Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose
federation
of three
ethnic
states.
[134]
Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for "a third way": federalizing Iraq and giving
Kurds
,
Shiites
, and
Sunnis
"breathing room" in their own regions.
[135]
In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,
[136]
but the idea failed to gain traction.
[133]
Presidential campaigns of 1988 and 2008
1988 campaign
Main article:
Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign
Biden at the White House in 1987
Biden formally declared his candidacy for the
1988 Democratic presidential nomination
on June 9, 1987.
[137]
He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming
Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination
hearings, and his appeal to
Baby Boomers
; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after
John F. Kennedy
.
[30]
[138]
[139]
He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.
[138]
[139]
By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,
[140]
and in September, he was accused of
plagiarizing
a speech by
British Labour Party
leader
Neil Kinnock
.
[141]
Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,
[142]
[143]
but did not on two occasions in late August.
[144]
: 230-232
[143]
Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.
[145]
Earlier that year he had also used passages from a 1967 speech by
Robert F. Kennedy
(for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from
John F. Kennedy's inaugural address
; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by
Hubert Humphrey
.
[146]
Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination,
Jesse Jackson
, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.
[16]
[23]
A few days later, an incident in law school in which Biden drew text from a
Fordham Law Review
article with inadequate citations was publicized.
[23]
He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.
[147]
At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.
[148]
Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,
[149]
[150]
and that he had marched in the
civil rights movement
.
[151]
The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures
[152]
and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by "the exaggerated shadow" of his past mistakes.
[153]
2008 campaign
Main article:
Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign
Biden campaigns at a
house party
in
Creston, Iowa
, July 2007.
After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared
his candidacy in the 2008 elections
.
[82]
[154]
[155]
During his campaign, Biden focused on the
Iraq War
, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.
[156]
Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate
Rudy Giuliani
: "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11."
[157]
Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator
Hillary Clinton
.
[158]
He never rose above single digits in
national polls of the Democratic candidates
. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the
Iowa caucuses
, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.
[159]
He withdrew from the race that evening.
[160]
Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.
[161]
: 336
In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,
[133]
[162]
while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.
[161]
: 28, 337-338
Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was "the real deal".

Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the
Old State Capitol
in
Springfield, Illinois
.
Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.
[163]
In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,
[163]
and developed a strong personal rapport.
[162]
On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his
running mate
.
[164]
The New York Times
reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with
foreign policy
and
national security
experience.
[165]
Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and
blue-collar
voters.
[166]
[167]
Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the
2008 Democratic National Convention
in
Denver
.
[168]
Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee,
Alaska Governor
Sarah Palin
.
[169]
[170]
Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.
[171]
[172]
Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. "How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?" he asked.
[161]
: 411-414, 419
Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders "Joe bombs" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.
[173]
Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.
[161]
: 411-414
As the
financial crisis of 2007-2010
reached a peak with the
liquidity crisis of September 2008
and the
proposed bailout of the United States financial system
became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700
billion
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
, which passed in the Senate, 74-25.
[174]
On October 2, 2008, he participated in the
vice-presidential debate
with Palin at
Washington University in St. Louis
. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall.
[175]
On November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365
electoral votes
to McCain-Palin's 173.
[176]
[177]
[178]
At the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,
[179]
as permitted by Delaware law.
[82]
On November
4, he was
reelected
to the Senate, defeating Republican
Christine O'Donnell
.
[180]
Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009.
[181]
Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350
billion for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program
,
[182]
and
resigned from the Senate
later that day.
[b]
2012 campaign
Main article:
Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign
In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the
2012 presidential election
,
[186]
but with Obama's popularity on the decline,
White House Chief of Staff
William M. Daley
conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.
[187]
The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,
[187]
and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.
[188]
Biden and Obama, July 2012
Biden's May 2012 statement that he was "absolutely comfortable" with
same-sex marriage
gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as "evolving".
[189]
Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.
[173]
[190]
[191]
Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,
[190]
and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.
[192]
Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,
[193]
[194]
while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.
[190]
The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the
reelection campaign
began in earnest in spring 2012.
[195]
[196]
An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would "put y'all back in chains" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.
[195]
[197]
[198]
In the
vice-presidential debate
on October 11 with Republican nominee
Paul Ryan
, Biden defended the Obama administration's record.
[199]
[200]
On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection
[201]
over
Mitt Romney
and Paul Ryan with 332 of 538
Electoral College votes
and 51% of the popular vote.

Vice presidency (2009-2017)
See also:
Presidency of Barack Obama
First term (2009-2013)
Biden being sworn in as vice president on
January 20, 2009
Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by
George W. Bush
's vice president,
Dick Cheney
, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.
[203]
On January 20, 2009, he was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States.
[204]
He was the first vice president from Delaware
[205]
and the first
Roman Catholic
vice president.
[206]
[207]
Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player "who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet".
[208]
In May, Biden visited
Kosovo
and affirmed the U.S. position that its "independence is irreversible".
[209]
Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
about
sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan
,
[210]
[211]
but his skepticism was valued,
[212]
and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.
[213]
Biden visited Iraq about every two months,
[133]
becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.
[212]
More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, "Joe, you do Iraq."
[214]
By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.
[196]
[215]
President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the
debt ceiling
deal which led to the
Budget Control Act of 2011
.
Biden oversaw
infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package
intended to help counteract the
ongoing recession
.
[216]
During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,
[212]
and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.
[217]
In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the
swine flu outbreak
led to a swift retraction by the White House.
[218]
The remark revived Biden's reputation for
gaffes
.
[219]
[213]
[220]
Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had "misread how bad the economy was" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.
[221]
On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
was "a big fucking deal". Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended
Sidwell Friends School
together.
[173]
Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.
[222]
Rahm Emanuel
, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter
groupthink
.
[208]
Obama said, "The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me."
[212]
The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their
official residence
in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.
[223]
Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the
2010 midterm elections
, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.
[186]
Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff
Rahm Emanuel
, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.
[224]
[225]
He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the
New START treaty
.
[224]
[225]
In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader
Mitch McConnell
, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary
extension of the Bush tax cuts
.
[225]
[226]
The package passed as the
Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010
.
Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the
White House Situation Room
to monitor the progress of the May 2011
mission
to kill
Osama bin Laden
.
In March 2011, Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.
[227]
The
U.S. debt ceiling crisis
developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the
Budget Control Act of 2011
, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented
U.S. default
had loomed.
[228]
[229]
[230]
Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011
U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden
,
[196]
[231]
lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.
[232]
[233]
In December 2012, Obama named Biden to head the
Gun Violence Task Force
, created to address the causes of
school shootings
and consider possible
gun control
to implement in the aftermath of the
Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting
.
[234]
Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the "
fiscal cliff
", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
being passed at the start of 2013.
[235]
[236]
It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.
[236]
Second term (2013-2017)
Biden in
Morocco
, November 2014
Biden was
inaugurated to a second term
on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at
Number One Observatory Circle
, his official residence, with Justice
Sonia Sotomayor
presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).
[237]
Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the
Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014
, which resolved the
federal government shutdown of 2013
and the
debt-ceiling crisis of 2013
. This was because Senate majority leader
Harry Reid
and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.
[238]
[239]
[240]
Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the
White House Council on Women and Girls
, begun in the first term, as well as the
White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault
, begun in January 2014 with Biden and
Valerie Jarrett
as co-chairs.
[241]
[242]
Biden favored arming
Syria's rebel fighters
.
[243]
As the
ISIL
insurgency in Iraq
intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.
[244]
[245]
Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL "to the gates of hell".
[246]
Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.
[247]
In August 2016, Biden visited
Serbia
, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister,
Aleksandar Vučić
, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.
[248]
Biden with Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu

Jerusalem
, March 9, 2016
Biden never
cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate
, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.
[249]
Role in the 2016 presidential campaign
During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the
2016 Democratic presidential nomination
.
[250]
With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with
Hillary Clinton
's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a "
Draft
Biden 2016"
PAC
was established.
[250]
[251]
[252]
By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, "nobody has a right
... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are."
[253]
On October 21, speaking from a podium in the
Rose Garden
with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.
[254]
[255]
[256]
Subsequent activities (2017-2019)
Biden with
Barack Obama
and
Donald Trump
, at the latter's
inauguration
on January 20, 2017
After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the
University of Pennsylvania
, developing the
Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement
. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president.
[257]
[258]
In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir,
Promise Me, Dad
, and went on a book tour.
[259]
By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.
[260]
Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the
presidency of Donald Trump
.
[261]
[262]
[263]
He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.
[264]
[265]
In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator
John McCain
, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.
[266]
Biden continued to support efforts to find treatments for cancer.

2020 presidential campaign
Main article:
Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign
Speculation and announcement
Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in
Philadelphia
, May 2019
Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.
[268]
When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying "never say never".
[269]
A
political action committee
known as
Time for Biden
was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.
[270]
He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,
[271]
saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the
Trump administration
and felt a "sense of duty".
[272]
Campaign
As the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.
[273]
[274]
[275]
With Democrats keenly focused on "electability" for defeating Trump,
[276]
this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.
[277]
It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.
[278]
[279]
In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
to investigate
alleged wrongdoing
by Biden and his son
Hunter Biden
.
[280]
Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.
[281]
[282]
[283]
Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.
[284]
Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in
a political scandal
[285]
and
Trump's impeachment
by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.
[286]
In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.
[287]
Biden had previously called himself a "tactile politician" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.
[288]
Journalist
Mark Bowden
described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he "doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer" and leaning forward to talk.
[289]
In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more "respectful of people's personal space".
[290]
Biden at a rally on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, February 2020
Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.
[291]
[292]
Despite this, he finished fourth in the
Iowa caucuses
, and eight days later, fifth in the
New Hampshire primary
.
[293]
[294]
He performed better in the
Nevada caucuses
, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind
Bernie Sanders
.
[295]
Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the
South Carolina primary
by more than 28 points.
[296]
After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates
Pete Buttigieg
and
Amy Klobuchar
, he made large gains in the March
3
Super Tuesday
primary elections. Biden won
18 of the next 26 contests
, putting him in the lead overall.
[297]
Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.
[298]
In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact,
accused
Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.
[299]
There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.
[299]
[300]
Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.
[301]
[302]
When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's
presumptive nominee
for president.
[303]
On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.
[304]
Former President
Barack Obama
endorsed Biden the next day.
[305]
On August 11, Biden announced U.S. Senator
Kamala Harris
of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first
South Asian American
vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.
[306]
On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the
2020 Democratic National Convention
as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the
2020 election

the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent,
Donald Trump
, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since
Bill Clinton
defeated
George H. W. Bush
in
1992
. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been "stolen" from him through "voter fraud", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous
conspiracy theories
about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to
overturn the election results
.
[309]
Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.
[310]
On November
23,
General Services Administrator
Emily W. Murphy
formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.
[311]
On January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the
White House
to march to the Capitol, saying, "We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved."
[312]
Soon after, they
attacked the Capitol
. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events "an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times".
[313]
[314]
After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President
Mike Pence
, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.

Inauguration
Main article:
Inauguration of Joe Biden
Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.
[316]
At 78, he is the oldest person to have assumed the office.
[316]
He is the second
Catholic
president (after
John F. Kennedy
)
[317]
and the first president whose home state is
Delaware
.
[318]
He is also the first man since
George H. W. Bush
to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after
Richard Nixon
in
1968
) to be elected president.
[319]
He is also the first president from the
Silent Generation
.
[320]
Biden's inauguration was "a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the
January 6 United States Capitol attack
. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since
1869
to not attend his successor's inauguration.
[321]
First 100 days
See also:
First 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency
In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the
Paris Climate Agreement
, ending the state of national emergency at the
border with Mexico
, directing the government to rejoin the
World Health Organization
,
face mask requirements
on
federal property
, measures to combat
hunger in the United States
,
[322]
[323]
[324]
[325]
and revoking permits for the construction of the
Keystone XL pipeline
.
[326]
[327]
[328]
In his first two weeks in office, Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since
Franklin D. Roosevelt
had in their first month in office.
[329]
On February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its
support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign
in Yemen.
[330]
Biden with his
Cabinet
, July 2021
On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the
World Health Organization
, Biden signed into law the
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021
, a $1.9 trillion
economic stimulus
and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the
economic
and health effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic
.
[331]
The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the
child tax credit
. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the
federal minimum wage
to $15 per hour, but after the
Senate parliamentarian
determined that including the increase in a
budget reconciliation
bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.
[332]
[333]
[334]
Also in March, amid
a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico
, Biden told migrants, "Don't come over." In the meantime, migrant adults "are being sent back", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.
[335]
Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the
Federal Emergency Management Agency
to help.
[336]
On April 14, Biden announced that the United States
would delay the withdrawal of all troops
from the
war in Afghanistan
until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.
[337]
In February 2020, the Trump administration had
made a deal
with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.
[338]
Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.
[339]
On April 22-23, Biden held an
international climate summit
at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its
greenhouse gas emissions
by 50%-52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.
[340]
[341]
On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his
first address to a joint session of Congress
.
[342]
Domestic policy
On June 17, Biden signed the
Juneteenth National Independence Day Act
, which officially declared
Juneteenth
a
federal holiday
.
[343]
Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1986.
[344]
In July 2021, amid a slowing of
the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country
and the spread of the
SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant
, Biden said that the country has "a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination" and that it was therefore "gigantically important" for Americans to be vaccinated.
[345]
Economy
Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through June 2023
Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the
COVID-19 recession
and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages and stock market returns, amid
significantly elevated inflation
. Real GDP grew 5.9 percent, the fastest rate in 37 years.
[346]
[347]
Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.
[348]
[349]
[350]
By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1 percent, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.
[351]
[352]
[353]
[354]
In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37 percent. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.
[355]
[356]
In early 2022, Biden made efforts to change his public image after entering the year with low approval ratings due to
inflation
and
high gas prices
, which continued to fall to approximately 40 percent in aggregated polls by February.
[357]
[358]
[359]
After 5.9 percent growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in Biden's second year to 2.1 percent, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5 percent in December. Inflation peaked at 8.9 percent in June but began easing in the second half of the year, to 6.5 percent in December. Stocks had their worst performance since 2008.
[360]
[361]
[362]
[363]
Widespread predictions of an imminent recession through 2022 and 2023 proved unwarranted and by late 2023 indicators showed economic acceleration.
[364]
Over the course of five days in March 2023,
three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed
, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global
contagion
. After
Silicon Valley Bank collapsed
, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a
bailout
by taxpayers.
[365]
He claimed that the
partial rollback
of
Dodd-Frank regulations
contributed to the bank's failure.
[366]
At the beginning of the
118th Congress
, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff that
raised the risk that the United States would default on its debt
.
[367]
Biden and House Speaker
Kevin McCarthy
struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023
. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.
[368]
The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.
[369]
[370]
Judiciary
Biden and
Ketanji Brown Jackson
watching the
U.S. Senate
vote on her confirmation, April 2022
By the end of 2021, 40 of
Biden's appointees
to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since
Ronald Reagan
.
[371]
Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.
[372]
Most of his appointments have been in
blue states
, making a limited impact since the courts in these states already generally lean liberal.
[373]
In January 2022, Supreme Court Justice
Stephen Breyer
, a moderate liberal nominated by
Bill Clinton
, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,
[374]
a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.
[375]
On February 25,
Biden nominated
federal judge
Ketanji Brown Jackson
to the Supreme Court.
[376]
She was confirmed by the
U.S. Senate
on April 7
[377]
and sworn in on June 30.
[378]
Infrastructure and climate
Further information:
Build Back Better Plan
and
Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration
Biden, UK prime minister
Boris Johnson
and UN secretary-general
António Guterres
at the opening ceremony of the
COP26 climate summit
in Glasgow on November 1, 2021
As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the
American Jobs Plan
, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.
[379]
[380]
After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
,
[381]
[382]
while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.
[383]
Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.
[384]
The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the
Build Back Better Act
, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the
social safety net
and includes major provisions on climate change.
[385]
[386]
The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a
party-line vote
through
budget reconciliation
, but struggled to win the support of Senator
Joe Manchin
, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.
[387]
After Manchin rejected the bill,
[388]
the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and comprehensively reworked into the
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.
[389]
The
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
was introduced by Senators
Chuck Schumer
and
Joe Manchin
.
[390]
[391]
The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and
climate change
, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of
Affordable Care Act
subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and
tax reform
.
[392]
According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower
US greenhouse gas emissions
between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
[393]
On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51-50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President
Kamala Harris
breaking the tie
. The bill was passed by the House on August 12
[393]
and was signed by Biden on August 16.
[394]
[395]
Before and during the
2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference
(COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the
European Union
cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.
[396]
He tried to convince China
[397]
and Australia
[398]
to do more. He convened an online
Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change
to press other countries to strengthen their climate policy.
[399]
[400]
Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.
[401]
Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.
[402]
In July 2023, when the
2023 heat waves
hit the U.S.
, Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.
[403]
[404]
COVID-19 diagnosis
On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for
COVID-19
with reportedly mild symptoms.
[405]
According to the White House, he was treated with
Paxlovid
.
[406]
He worked in isolation in the White House for five days
[407]
and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30.
[408]
Other domestic policy issues
In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the
Senate filibuster
to allow for the passing of the
Freedom to Vote Act
and
John Lewis Voting Rights Act
, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke
cloture
.
[409]
The rules change failed when two Democratic senators,
Joe Manchin
and
Kyrsten Sinema
, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.
[410]
In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan
Postal Service Reform Act of 2022
to revamp the finances and operations of the
United States Postal Service
agency.
[411]
On July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps on the
Mexico-United States border
in
Arizona
near
Yuma
, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. During his presidential campaign, Biden had pledged to cease all future
border wall construction
.
[412]
This occurred after both allies and critics of Biden criticized his administration's management of the southern border.
[413]
Biden and senior advisers watch the Senate pass the
CHIPS and Science Act
on July 27, 2022.
In the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
aimed to address gun reform issues following the
Robb Elementary School shooting
in
Uvalde, Texas
.
[414]
The act's gun control provisions include extended
background checks
for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of
Federal Firearms License
requirements, funding for state
red flag laws
and other
crisis intervention
programs, further criminalization of
arms trafficking
and
straw purchases
, and partial closure of the
boyfriend loophole
.
[415]
[416]
[417]
Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.
[418]
The
Honoring our PACT Act of 2022
was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.
[419]
The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including
burn pits
, during military service.
[420]
The bill gained significant media coverage due to the activism of comedian
Jon Stewart
.
[421]
Biden signed the
CHIPS and Science Act
into law on August 9, 2022.
[422]
The act provides billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of
semiconductors
, to
compete economically with China
.
[423]
On October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of "small" amounts of
cannabis
possession under federal law.
[424]
Two months later, he signed the
Respect for Marriage Act
, which repealed the
Defense of Marriage Act
and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of
same-sex
and
interracial
marriages.
[425]
2022 elections
Biden holding a rally at
Bowie State University
in
Maryland
for gubernatorial candidate
Wes Moore
, November 7, 2022
On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast
Philadelphia speech
, Biden called for a "battle for the soul of the nation". Off camera, he called Trump supporters "semi-fascists", which Republican commentators denounced.
[426]
[427]
[428]
A predicted Republican
wave election
did not materialize and the race for
U.S. Congress
control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of
222 seats in the House of Representatives
,
[429]
[430]
[431]
[432]
and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the
U.S. Senate
, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.
[433]
[c]
It was the first midterm election since
1986
in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since
1934
in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.
[436]
Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,
[437]
and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.
[438]
Discovery of classified documents
Main article:
Joe Biden classified documents incident
On November 2, 2022, while packing files at the
Penn Biden Center
, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating to his vice presidency in a "locked closet".
[439]
[440]
According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the
U.S. National Archives
, which recovered the documents the next day.
[440]
On November 14, Attorney General
Merrick Garland
appointed U.S. Attorney
John R. Lausch Jr.
to conduct an investigation.
[441]
[442]
On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's
Wilmington, Delaware
residence.
[443]
The findings were made public on January 10, 2023, after several news organizations published articles on the investigation.
[440]
[444]
On January 12, Garland appointed
Robert K. Hur
as special counsel to investigate "possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records".
[445]
On January 20, after a 13-hour
consensual search
by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.
[446]
FBI agents searched Biden's home in
Rehoboth Beach
on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.
[447]
Foreign policy
Biden meeting with
Secretary General of NATO
Jens Stoltenberg
in the
Oval Office
, June 7, 2021
In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended
a G7 summit
,
a NATO summit
, and an EU summit, and held
one-on-one talks
with Russian president
Vladimir Putin
.
[448]
In September 2021, Biden announced
AUKUS
, a
security pact
between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure "peace and stability in the
Indo-Pacific
over the long term"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use.
[449]
Withdrawal from Afghanistan
Main article:
Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020-2021)
Biden in a video conference with Vice President
Harris
and the
U.S. National Security team
, discussing the
Fall of Kabul
on August 15, 2021
American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a
February 2020 US-Taliban agreement
that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.
[450]
The Taliban began
an offensive
on May 1.
[451]
[452]
By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.
[338]
Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, "The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely."
[338]
On August 15,
the Afghan government collapsed
under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President
Ashraf Ghani
fled the country.
[338]
[453]
Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.
[454]
He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,
[455]
with the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies described as chaotic and botched.
[456]
[457]
[458]
On August 16, Biden addressed the "messy" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation "unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated".
[453]
[459]
He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be "dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves".
[459]
[460]
On August 26, a
suicide bombing at the Kabul airport
killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were "planners and facilitators", according to a U.S. Army general.
[461]
On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians "a tragic mistake".
[462]
The U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies "an extraordinary success".
[463]
He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.
[464]
Aid to Ukraine
Biden with
refugees from Ukraine
in
Warsaw
, Poland, March 2022
In late February 2022, after warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden led the U.S. response to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine
, imposing severe
sanctions on Russia
and authorizing over $8 billion in
weapons shipments to Ukraine
.
[465]
[466]
[467]
On April 29, Biden asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,
[468]
but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.
[469]
Biden blamed
Vladimir Putin
for the emerging
energy
and
food crises
,
[470]
saying, "Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major breadbaskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world."
[471]
On February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
Biden visited Kyiv
and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
first lady of Ukraine
Olena Zelenska
.
[472]
While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war.
[473]
The trip was unannounced, and involved major security coordination to ensure safety.
[474]
China relations
Further information:
China-United States relations
Biden with Chinese leader
Xi Jinping
during the
G20 summit in Bali
, November 14, 2022
China's assertiveness, particularly in the Pacific, remains a challenge for Biden. The
Solomon Islands-China security pact
caused alarm, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as
Anthony Albanese
succeeded
to the premiership of Australia and
Jacinda Ardern
's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.
[475]
[476]
[477]
In a September 2022 interview with
60 Minutes
, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of "an unprecedented attack" by the Chinese,
[478]
which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of "
strategic ambiguity
" toward China and Taiwan.
[479]
[480]
[481]
The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.
[482]
Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.
[482]
[483]
[479]
In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.
[484]
On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a
suspected Chinese surveillance balloon
off the coast of
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
.
[485]
[486]
The Biden administration described the balloon as carrying two
railroad cars
' equivalent of spy equipment with a propeller for maneuverability.
[487]
[488]
The
State Department
said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations.
[489]
The
Chinese government
denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological)
airship
that had blown off course.
[490]
The incident was seen as damaging to U.S. and China relations.
[491]
[492]
[493]
Israel
Biden with Israeli President
Isaac Herzog
and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023
In May 2021, during
a flareup
in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict
, Biden said, "my party still supports Israel".
[494]
In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that
devolved into a war
, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and
Saudi Arabia
.
[495]
Biden stated
his unequivocal support for Israel
, deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,
[496]
and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.
[497]
He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
[498]
Other foreign issues
In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the
death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi
, the second leader of the
Islamic State
.
[499]
In late July, Biden approved the
drone strike
that
killed Ayman al-Zawahiri
, the second leader of
Al-Qaeda
, and an integral member in the planning of the
September 11 attacks
.
[500]
The
2022 OPEC+ oil production cut
caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding
alliance

In August 2023, Biden's letter to
Peruvian
President
Dina Boluarte
for
Fiestas Patrias
praising her government for "advancing our democratic values, including human rights" raised controversy due to
her administration's violent response to protests
, including the
Ayacucho
and
Juliaca
massacres.

Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden
On September 12, 2023, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that recent House investigations "paint a picture of corruption" by him and his family.
[505]
[506]
[507]
[508]
Congressional investigations, most notably
by the House Oversight committee
, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.

Ending months of speculation,
[513]
[514]
on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for a second term as president in the
2024 election
, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his
2020 presidential campaign
.
[515]
It was also announced that
Julie Chávez Rodriguez
would serve as campaign manager and
Quentin Fulks
would be principal deputy campaign manager. Co-chairs include
Lisa Blunt Rochester
,
Jim Clyburn
,
Chris Coons
,
Tammy Duckworth
,
Jeffrey Katzenberg
, and
Gretchen Whitmer
.
On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was just 37 percent.
[516]
Most who were surveyed in the poll said that the economy was their biggest concern.
[516]
During his campaign, Biden has promoted
his economic record
by touting the creation of over 13 million jobs, faster pandemic recovery in terms of GDP than other G7 countries, and the longest period of low unemployment in over 50 years.

Michael McFaul
, is pictured in the background.
Pope Francis
(left) meets Joe Biden at the White House, September 2015.
Biden is a
moderate Democrat
[519]
whose positions are deeply influenced by
Catholic social teaching
.
[520]
[521]
[522]
According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, "it has become second nature to describe his politics with such ready-made labels as centrist or moderate."
[523]
Accetti says that Biden represents an Americanized form of
Christian democracy
, taking positions characteristic of both the
center-right
and
center-left
.
[523]
Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher
Jacques Maritain
, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.
[524]
In 2022, journalist
Sasha Issenberg
wrote that Biden's "most valuable political skill" was "an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party".
[525]
Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.
[526]
[527]
But he supports raising the corporate tax only up to 28% from the 21% established in the 2017 bill, not back to 35%, the corporate tax rate until 2017.
[528]
He voted for the
North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA)
[529]
and the
Trans-Pacific Partnership
.
[530]
Biden is a staunch supporter of the
Affordable Care Act
(ACA).
[531]
[532]
He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.
[531]
Biden's plan aims to expand
health insurance coverage
to 97% of Americans, including by creating a
public health insurance option
.
[533]
Biden did not support national
same-sex marriage
rights while in the Senate and voted for the
Defense of Marriage Act
,
[534]
but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.
[535]
Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012.
[536]
[537]
As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a
Police Officer's Bill of Rights
measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.
[538]
[539]
In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing
cannabis
,
[540]
after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator.
[541]
[542]
Biden believes action must be taken on
global warming
. As a senator, he co-sponsored the
Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act
, the most stringent climate bill in the
United States Senate
.
[543]
Biden opposes drilling for oil in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
.
[544]
He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.
[545]
His program includes reentering the
Paris Agreement
,
nature conservation
, and
green building
.
[546]
Biden supports
environmental justice
, including
climate justice
, and has taken steps to implement it.
[547]
A major step is increasing
energy efficiency
,
water efficiency
and
resilience to climate disasters
in low-income houses. This should help mitigate climate change, reduce costs for households, and improve health and safety.
[548]
[549]
Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the "only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war".
[550]
Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a "War on American Energy", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.
[551]
Biden has said the U.S. needs to "get tough" on China, calling it the "most serious competitor" that poses challenges to the United States' "prosperity, security, and democratic values".
[552]
[553]
Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the
Xinjiang
region to the
Chinese Communist Party
leader
Xi Jinping
, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.
[554]
[555]
Biden has said he is against
regime change
, but for providing non-military support to opposition movements.
[556]
He opposed direct U.S.
intervention in Libya
,
[557]
[222]
voted against U.S. participation in the
Gulf War
,
[558]
voted in favor of the
Iraq War
,
[559]
and supports a
two-state solution
in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict
.
[560]
Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the
Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
and to reevaluate the
United States' relationship
with
Saudi Arabia
.
[262]
Biden supports extending the
New START
arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of
nuclear weapons
deployed by both sides.
[561]
[562]
In 2021, Biden officially
recognized
the
Armenian genocide
, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.
[563]
[e]
Biden has supported
abortion rights
throughout his presidency. In 2019, he said he supported
Roe v. Wade
and repealing the
Hyde Amendment
.
[566]
[567]
After
Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization
, he criticized
near-total bans on abortion access
passed in a majority of
Republican
-controlled states,
[568]
and took measures to protect
abortion rights in the United States
.
[569]
He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of
Roe
into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.

Public image
Main article:
Public image of Joe Biden
President Obama presents Biden with the
Presidential Medal of Freedom
with Distinction, January 12, 2017.
Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy
members of the Senate
,
[572]
[573]
which he attributed to his having been elected young.
[574]
Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed
campaign finance reform
measures during his first term.
[94]
As of November 2009
, Biden's net worth was $27,012.
[575]
By November 2020
, the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.
[576]
[577]
The political writer
Howard Fineman
has written, "Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift."
[34]
Political columnist
David S. Broder
wrote that Biden has grown over time: "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better."
[34]
Journalist
James Traub
has written that "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself".
[133]
In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.
[578]
[579]
In 2020,
CNN
wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him "healer-in-chief", while
The New York Times
described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.
[580]
Journalist and TV anchor
Wolf Blitzer
has called Biden loquacious;
[581]
journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for "talking too much", leaning in close "like an old pal with something urgent to tell you".
[289]
He often deviates from prepared remarks
[582]
and sometimes "puts his foot in his mouth".
[169]
[583]
[584]
Biden has a reputation for being prone to
gaffes
[585]
and in 2018 called himself "a gaffe machine".
[586]
[587]
The New York Times
wrote that Biden's "weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything".
[169]
During his presidency, several Republicans have criticized Biden's publicized gaffes as related to cognitive health issues due to his age, which Biden has repeatedly denied.
[588]
[589]
[590]
[591]
According to
The New York Times
, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by
The New Yorker
in 2014.
[592]
[593]
For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the
civil rights movement
than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.
[592]
The
Times
wrote, "Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences."
[593]
Job approval
According to
Morning Consult
polling, Biden maintained an
approval rating
above 50 percent in the first eight months of his presidency. In August 2021, it began to decline, and it reached the low forties by December.
[594]
This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the
Delta variant
,
high inflation and gas prices
, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.
[595]
[596]
[597]
[598]
In February 2021,
Gallup, Inc.
reported that 98 percent of Democrats approved of Biden.
[599]
[600]
As of October 2023, that number had declined to 75 percent.
[601]
His approval rating among Republicans reached a high of 12 percent in February 2021 and again in July 2021.

Spouse
Maria de Vergara Azcárate
Alonso Turrillo de Yebra
was a Spanish military engineer and architect, at the service of the kings
Felipe II
,
Felipe III
and
Felipe IV
. Turrillo became the first royal treasurer of
Madrid
in 1607 and later arrived to the
new Kingdom of Granada
in 1621 with a royal order that accredited him to create the first Mint of
Casa de la Moneda
or
Casa de Moneda
is Spanish for mint (coin) (literally, house of money) in the
New Kingdom of Granada
. Turrillo became the first royal treasurer of
Santafe
de Bogotá.
[1]
[2]
Turillo was an official in
Cartagena de Indias
and, Superintendent Captain of the Spanish Empire.
Biography
[
edit
]
de Yerba studied mathematics and, in 1596 became an assistant to the engineer
Cristóbal de Rojas
, with whom he drew up plans in
Gibraltar
and carried out various works until 1598, the year in which he went to
Portugal
by order of the
Council of War
. He was under the orders of Leonardo Turriano, senior engineer of that kingdom, Turrillo carried out the plans and works for the construction of the
San Antonio fort
, as well as repairs of its port.
In 1607 he was at court, where he was entrusted with the plans for the construction of the
Casa de la Moneda del Pósito
in
Madrid
. In 1611 he was proposed to go to
Milan
. As a consequence of his well-earned fame as an architect, in 1613 the
Duke of Uceda
asked him to build a palace for him at Court, a palace that ended in 1619 and was highly criticized at the time for its 'strange novelty'. In 1618 he carried out the project of stakes to close the bar of
La Mamora
(current Moroccan city of
Mehdía
).
His experience in the construction of buildings for the crown or the nobility would motivate him to be sent to
Santa Fe de Bogotá
, in the
New Kingdom of Granada
, in 1620 to build a Mint there. In this regard, according to the Royal Decree issued in Madrid on June 10, 1620.
[3]
[4]
Turrillo set out for Santa Fe with various officials, personal belongings, tools, and instruments for the work of the currency. It is known that there are coins of 8 reales minted in Cartagena of the year 1621, which had to be made sometime between August and no later than December of that year.
By Royal Decree of 24 August 1626 addressed to
Diego de Escobar
, Governor of
Cartagena
, the authorisation for the minting of vellón coins was rescinded, authorising the minting of silver coins, but restricted to the values of 1/4, 1/2, 1 and 2 reales. Minting began that year in Cartagena, and despite not having authorization, gold was also chipped. Due to this, by order of the Santa Fe audience it was closed in 1629. Later, the Spanish monarch ordered its reopening in 1630, lifting the restriction. The mint minted gold and silver coins of the macuquina type with very rough workmanship until 1635, when it was closed by Royal Decree.
[5]
Given the endemic problem of lack of drinking water in
Havana
, one of the various systems used consisted of transporting water from the
Almendares
or Chorrera rivers through ditches or pipes that avoided the cumbersome and slow system used until then. However, it was not easy to carry it out, since, as was the case in many cases, jurisdictional and administrative problems delayed it until 1566, when the fortification master, Francisco de Colona, began the work called La Zanja. Alonso Turrillo intervened in the work in 1623, needing to repair the Chorrera dam, because with 'the strong storms and floods it has broken a lot of ground and is exposed to dangerous floods'.
In 1625 went to
Cádiz
, where he received the order to go to the port of
La Mamora
in order to study the possible closure of his bar, a commission from which Turrillo excused himself, citing his many obligations. Finally, in 1629 he was ordered to go to
Cartagena de Indias
, for everything appropriate to its fortification, for which he had to embark on the navy of D.
Fadrique de Toledo
. Between 1631 and 1634 he held the position of governor of the province of
Antioquia
and it seems that he was the first to introduce a carriage in Bogotá.
[6]
[7]
[8]
His relative,
Antonio de Vergara Azcárate
inherited the title of Treasurer and took over the royal job for 50 years.

Military Museum of Colombia
[
edit
]
The museum was founded by the military engineer Turrillo Yebra Alonso in the seventeenth century.
It houses the art collection of coins and
Bank of the Republic
. In 1975 it was declared a national monument. The property of Calle de la Esperanza No. 4-92 passed to
Antonio Ricaurte
, courageous and brave captain who enlisted in the Patriot Army in 1813 by the request of
The Liberator
Simón Bolívar
, in the fight for freedom.

Heinrich Alexander Stoll
was the
pen name
used by the German writer
Heinrich Joachim Friedrich Karl Hans Stoll
(8 December 1910 - 4 March 1977). During the 1950s and 1960s he emerged in
East Germany
as a prolific author of adventure novels, historical novels and reworkings of ancient legends, along with short stories and science fiction works. There are nevertheless suggestions that the reality of his own experiences as a young man, during
twelve years under Hitler
followed by
six years under Soviet military administration
and the early years of the
Ulbricht
dictatorship
, were a match for almost any novel.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Life
[
edit
]
Stoll was born in
Parchim
, a garrison town and market town a short distance inland from
Schwerin
and
Rostock
in the marshy flatlands of northern Germany. Heinrich Christian Stoll, his father, was a career soldier and, at the time he was born, a sergeant in the
Second Great Ducal Mecklenburg Dragoon Regiment No. 18
. (Heinrich Christian Stoll later became a
railway
official.
[1]
)   The infant was baptised a Protestant, after approximately six weeks, on 22 January 1911 in the parish
[4]
and grew up, in
Mecklenburg-Schwerin
, the Grand Duchy of his birth.
[5]
It was also in Parchim that he attended the local
"Friedrich-Franz Gymnasium" (secondary school)
.
[6]
He then enrolled in 1929 and 1932 successively at the
Universities of Erlangen
and
of Rostock
,  studying both
Protestant Theology
and
Art history
, and graduating in 1933.
[6]
Stoll then served as a
Lutheran vicar
, his duties covering the parishes in and around
Perlin bei Wittenburg
,
Ratzeburg
,
Neubukow
and
Wismar
.
[1]
For a young churchman the times had become acutely uncertain, following the
coming to power
in early 1933 of the
Hitler government
, quickly followed by the
transformation
of
Germany
into a
one-
party
dictatorship
. That involved creating a unified
German Evangelical (i.e. Protestant) Church
which could be formed into a nationalised German version of the
Church of England
. The move met with powerful opposition from within the
Prussian Union of Churches
and other groupings of protestant churches that had evolved without succumbing to any of the pressures to unify and consolidate implicit in the government's church strategy. The result was the emergence, between 1933 and 1935, of the
Confessing Church
, which quickly became an anti-government mass-movement. Members included many of those German protestants who had not voted for Hitler. Some of the most prominent members were those who were most appalled by the
Racial policy of Nazi Germany
. Evidently antisemitism was to be no mere populist device for shrill street politicians but a
core underpinning
of government strategy
. Heinrich Alexander Stoll became a deeply engaged member of the
Confessing Church
. He was therefore
suspended from ecclesiastical office
in 1935 and subjected to an immediate - though possibly temporary - ban on preaching or officiating at church services. Despite the ban, he was not prevented from writing and publishing his first known book:  "Theodor Kliefoth als Kirchenführer" was a biographical work on the nineteenth century church reformer from
Mecklenburg
,
Theodor Kliefoth
. This was published in 1936. The author was identified simply as "Heinrich Stoll". The next year he published another more modest book, "Capri, Traum und Leben, Tagebuch 1937".
[1]
[7]
Between 1937 and 1943 Heinrich Alexander Stoll lived abroad, undertaking what one source identifies as "longer stays" in Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy. Most sources are silent as to what he did during most of this period, but once he settled in
Rome
he supported himself through "small journalistic assignments [for] Swiss newspapers".
[1]
[8]
Most Germans in Rome during this period were soldiers involved in fighting. Stoll was not one of these, but family papers that became available after 2017 indicate that he was in contact with the German embassy, evidently undertaking assignments that could be construed as "intelligence related".
[8]
He also found time to write another novel: "Der Tod des Hypathos. Novelle" was published in
Leipzig
in 1942.
[9]
By this time he was living in
Rome
, where he made a study of
Classical archaeology
and worked as a correspondent for foreign newspapers.
[2]
In July 1943, with an
Anglo-American invasion from the south
known to be imminent,
the King of Italy
had
Mussolini arrested
. For German military planners, the fall of Italian fascism was unwelcome, but it was not a surprise. Central and northern Italy were transformed into
a German puppet state
in September 1943. Germans who had hoped to avoid the reach of the German government by living out the war years in Italy, including Heinrich Alexander Stoll, were rounded up and forcibly repatriated. In or before 1944 Stoll found himself serving the German war effort through membership of a
punishment battalion
. During 1944 he was seriously wounded which ruled out further involvement in the fighting during the final part of the war. By the time
war ended
, in May 1945, he was a prisoner of war. His term of detention at this stage was relatively brief, however.
[2]
[1]
[10]
After the war he returned home to
Parchim
which was now being
administered
as part of the
Soviet occupation zone
. It was, in some ways, an unfortunate decision, since according to at least one source
Parchim
was the scene of "extreme Stalinist persecution" during the immediate post-war years. The same commentator asserts that, measured by the number of death sentences carried out as a proportion of the overall population, Parchim suffered more than anywhere else in the Soviet occupation zone, presumably reflecting decisions taken by local military commanders.
[11]
Stoll was not executed; but nor was he unaffected. During 1945 he joined the
Liberal Democratic Party
, at this stage not yet subsumed into
"bloc party" structure
of what would become, within five years, a new kind of German
one-
party
dictatorship
. He also headed up the local branch of the rapidly evolving
National Cultural Association
. It was a position of some privilege and of some influence in the local community.
[1]
In 1946 Stoll was arrested by the
NKVD
, on behalf of the
local military administrators
, possibly on account of some overheard injudicious remark.
[2]
Two years of detention in
Special Camp No.9
at
Fünfeichen
(
Neubrandenburg
) followed.
[3]
[a]
After his release Stoll was again engaged prominently in the activities of the local branch of the
National Cultural Association
at nearby
Schwerin
.
[13]
In October 1949 the
Soviet occupation zone
was rebranded and relaunched as the
Soviet sponsored
German Democratic Republic (East Germany)
:  it was an eventful year, also, for Stoll personally. In November of that year he was lured to West Berlin where he was arrested and taken into investigative custody on suspicion of espionage. Details are hazy. The incident seems to have originated with suspicions that Stoll had denounced the teacher (and later an author) Alexandra Wiese (1923-1995) to the
security services
, leading to Wiese's arrest. After being released he returned once more to
Parchim
, where former comrades from
the LDPD
and the
Cultural Association
now kept their distance.  On 6 January 1950 Heinrich Alexander Stoll disappeared without a trace.
There was no trial, but it turned out that Stoll had been sentenced to ten years of
hard labour
in
Siberia
.
[14]
Following the availability of hitherto undisclosed family papers, there recent hints have appeared that he could have become a focus of suspicion among the townsfolk on account of his homo-sexuality.
[8]
It has never become entirely clear, however, why he had been singled out for detention:  his subsequent historical-biographical novel on the lives of
Heinrich Schliemann
and
Johann Joachim Winckelmann
nevertheless offers up clues, hints and some persuasive narratives. It is not impossible that Stoll was suspected by his Soviet captors of involvement in espionage during and/or directly after the
Hitler years
.
[14]
A fellow detainee in
Usollag
camp who became a friend was the German architect
Rudolf Hamburger
, a man with his own complicated connections to Soviet espionage dating back to the 1930s, when Hamburger and
his wife
lived (initially) in
Shanghai
. Hamburger's own posthumously published memoire of time in the Soviet camps offers intriguing insights into the lives the two men led at this time.
[14]
After
Stalin died
, in March 1953, the political climate in the
Soviet Union
began to shift
. An early indication of the changes to come was the release of large numbers inmates from the labour camps, among them many politically involved Germans who had for various reasons ended up in Soviet captivity during the fifteen years since
1938
and survived. Stoll and Hamburger were both released in 1953. It seems that Hamburger was obliged to remain in the Soviet Union for several more years, but Stoll was able to return to the
German Democratic Republic
that same year. He returned yet again to
Parchim
and re-embarked on his career as a free-lance author. During the next couple of decades he proved exceptionally prolific as a writer.
[3]
[14]
An unwelcome interruption came in 1957 when he was arrested on suspicion of fornication with minors towards the end of the year. He was released after two months in investigative detention. After this latest manifestation of hostility on the part of local officialdom he finally decided to leave Parchim, relocating in 1958 to
Thyrow (Trebbin)
, near
Potsdam
, where he made his home between 1958 and his death in 1977:
[8]
Personal
[
edit
]
According to one source Stoll had only one sibling, a sister who died young.
[1]
He never married and had no children.  There were remoter kinsfolk with whom he was in good terms, however. His literary estate (and reputation) are currently tended by the retired forester Burkhard Unterdörfer who also inherited and lives in Stoll's former home. Unterdörfer recalls his adoptive "Uncle Alexander" with affection.
[8]
[15]
"He always bought me something when he came [to visit his friend and cousin and the speaker's father], and often surprised me   .... and I remember, soon after I got my driver's licence, I drove with him to Poland in my parents' car   .... I learned a whole lot, not just about art history, but also about how to handle difficult people   .... when the car got stuck we spent the night in a field without problems.  The next morning the farmer helped us again [apparently thanks to Stoll skills at negotiating away their presence in the field, in Polish, with a potentially indignant farmer]".
[8]
[b]
Heinrich Alexander Stoll himself was a private man, who lived alone and spoke little of himself. Burkhard Unterdörfer, who probably knew him better than anyone else still alive half a century after Stoll's death, is unhesitating in identifying what he saw as the high point of his life: in 1966 Stoll enjoyed the privilege of a private audience with
the pope
(who had, like him, spent most of the
war years
living mostly out of sight in
Rome
).

Peabody and Stearns
.
Biography
[
edit
]
John Goddard Stearns Jr. was born May 18, 1843, in
New York City
.
[1]
He was the oldest son of John Goddard Stearns Sr. and Elizabeth Stearns, and was descendent of
Richard Warren
.
[2]
Stearns moved to
Brookline, Massachusetts
in 1861 and he remained a Brookline resident for the remainder of his life.
[1]
[3]
Stearns was educated at
Harvard University
's
Lawrence Scientific School
in
Cambridge, Massachusetts
and graduated in 1863. After graduating, Stearns entered the Boston architectural firm of
Ware
&
Van Brunt
and eventually became head draftsman for the firm.
[3]
In 1870, Stearns partnered with
Robert Swain Peabody
, who also worked at Ware & Van Brunt, to form
Peabody and Stearns
.
[1]
Peabody and Stearns
[
edit
]
Stearns made a significant contribution to his firm and the architectural profession. He combined his technical engineering training with his "true engineer's instinct" and had a keen sense of order and proportion in planning and design. He was dedicated to overseeing the firm's projects, ensuring they progressed smoothly and avoided any potential issues.
[1]
He saw not only that the work was going right, but also that it
did not go wrong
. He often said that the secret of successful superintendence was to know that something must be wrong, to find it, and to make it right.
He believed in the importance of thoroughness and insisted on high-quality work according to the specifications and contracts he established using his extensive knowledge of construction, building materials, and methods. This approach represented a significant departure from the lax practices of the past.
[1]
Peabody and Stearns designed numerous buildings over their 47-year partnership, some of which include:
Cutler Hall
(1877-1880),
Colorado College
,
Colorado Springs, Colorado

Stearns was a member of the
American Institute of Architects
and elected a
Fellow
in 1894. He was also member of the
Boston Society of Architects
and the
St. Botolph Club
in Boston.
[1]
[3]
Family and death
[
edit
]
Stearns married Ellen Elizabeth Abbott on December 5, 1866, and had two children. Their son, Frank A. Stearns, was also an architect. He continued his father's firm with W. Cornell Appleton as Appleton & Stearns after his death. Stearns died September 16, 1917, at his summer home in
Duxbury, Massachusetts
, less than three weeks after Peabody.

Three Dialogues of Pierre Messie, concerning the nature of the Sun, Earth, & all things that have appeared in the air.
Printed in Paris by Federic Morel, 1570. Translator: Marie De Cotteblanche
Marie De Cotteblanche
(born ca. 1520, Paris - died  before 1584, probably Paris) was a French noblewoman known for her skill in languages and translation of works from Spanish to French.
She was daughter of Guy De Cotteblanche, a lawyer for the
Parlement
of Paris. Her mother was Catherine Hesseline whom he married in 1517. She had an older brother Elie, who became a Gentleman of the Royal Chamber in 1571, and a sister Marguerite. The poet
François de Belleforest
dedicated a poem to the family in 1560 called
Chasse d'amour
. There are indications the family were
French Protestants
.
[1]
Marie de Cotteblanche studied languages, philosophy, science, and mathematics. Her praises were sung by the bibliographer Le Croix de Maine.
[2]
[3]
Her patron was Marguerite de Saluces, the Marachale de
Termes
who taught her Italian.
Her only known surviving work is her 1566 translation of a best-selling text,
Coloquios y Diálogos
(1547) by the Spanish encyclopaedist
Pedro Mexía
.  The French title was
Trois dialogues de M. Pierre Messie, touchant la nature du soleil, de la terre et de toutes les choses qui se font et apparaissent en l'air
(Three Dialogues … on the Sun and the Earth). Its dialog form appealed to a wide readership and it was reprinted 29 times between 1566 and 1643.

and a former member of the
J-pop
group
Morning Musume
, joining as a member of the eighth generation from the audition in Japan during December 2006. Mitsui's audition process was documented during the late 2006 episodes of
Hello! Morning
. She performed
Ayumi Hamasaki
's "
Blue Bird
" in round one of her audition and Morning Musume's "
Furusato
" and "
Osaka Koi no Uta
" in rounds two and three. She graduated from Morning Musume on May 18, 2012. She retired from the entertainment industry to pursue culinary studies in New Zealand on November 3, 2018.

[
edit
]
On December 10, 2006, she alone out of five (originally six, but Ayami Masuda dropped out) audition finalists was chosen to join
Morning Musume
.
An article published on December 11, 2006 revealed that Mitsui wouldn't be present in the
57th edition
of
Kōhaku Uta Gassen
but would instead be featured in the group's 32nd single,
Egao Yes Nude
, which was released on February 14, 2007,
[3]
following her first public appearance on the last round of the Hello! Project Winter 2007 Tours, ~Shūgetsu 10th Anniversary~
(
～集結! 10th Anniversary～
)
, which took place between January 27, 2007 and January 28, 2007 at
Saitama Super Arena
. She also took part in Morning Musume's 2007 Spring Tour ~Sexy 8 Beat~.
One week after the results of Happy 8 Ki Audition were announced, Mitsui was featured in a small segment of
Hello! Morning
which included footage from a press conference given on the eleventh. During the conference, Mitsui revealed her goal of captivating the public by means of her cheerful personality and smile, emulating fellow member
Koharu Kusumi
, whom she admires and strives to equal or surpass.
Following her concert debut, Mitsui was also featured in a small segment of the
Oha Suta
morning programme entitled
I want to express my gratitude
(
"ありがとうを伝えたい"
,
Arigatō o tsutaetai
)
, which purports to show the viewers a fictionalized account of the events following her first concert appearances, dealing with Mitsui's sadness over the fact she had to part with her former classmates due to her becoming an idol.
Her first appearance at a non-Hello! Project related event took place on February 8, 2007, on
Utaban
, as part of
Morning Musume
.
In October 2007, Mitsui was placed in the unit
Athena & Robikerottsu
along with fellow Morning Musume member
Risa Niigaki
, as well as
Saki Nakajima
and
Chisato Okai
of
Cute
.
On the November 25, 2007 episode of
Haromoni@
, Mitsui got the voice role of Gurossan in the anime
Kirarin Revolution
starring Kirari Tsukishima, voiced by Koharu Kusumi.
[4]
On April 6, 2008, Hello! Project announced that Mitsui would not be able to perform in the 2008 spring tour due to her being in very poor health.
[5]
Later in the week, it was discovered that she had suffered from
acute appendicitis
, and would be out of action for two more weeks.
[6]
Between December 15, 2010 (the graduation of
Linlin
) and January 2, 2011 (the addition of
Mizuki Fukumura
,
Erina Ikuta
,
Riho Sayashi
and
Kanon Suzuki
), Mitsui was the only member of Morning Musume under the age of 20. She was injured in the Spring 2011 during the last few dates of Morning Musume's Fantasy DX concert tour. She suffered a fracture to her ankle which put her out of concert action. She continued to participate in live performances sitting on a stool. Mid 2011 it was announced that her injury had become worse. She was ordered to bed rest by the doctor. She took part in Morning Musume's 47th Single, but did not appear in the dance shot accompanying the single. Aika did not participate in the 2011 Morning Musume fall concert until the final day on September 30, when
Ai Takahashi
graduated from the group. However, she was featured in all of the concert goods that were released.
[7]
On May 4, 2012, Mitsui announced that she would graduate from Morning Musume along with the current leader,
Risa Niigaki
, on the 18th of the same month. This was due to her ankle injury which put her on hiatus since spring the previous year. Mitsui was the first to leave the group, but not Hello! Project since the Elder Club graduated in 2009. In October 2012, it was announced that Mitsui would be a member of the new unit GREEN FIELDS alongside
Saki Shimizu
and
Yuka Miyazaki
.
[7]
2013-present (Post Morning Musume)
[
edit
]
On March 2 and 3, Mitsui participated in SATOYAMA e Yukou ~Forest For Rest~ along with other Hello! Project and UP-FRONT PROMOTION members. It was announced that Mitsui would "graduate" from Young Town. She was replaced by Iikubo Haruna beginning in April.
Beginning on April 6, Mitsui became a regular on the radio show "ALMA KAMINIITO Sound Map," replacing Ohno Munehiko.
In May, Mitsui starred in a new stageplay called Okujou Wonderland.
From October 12 to 20, Mitsui performed in a play called Nettai Danshi 2 in Zenrosai Hall / Space Zero.
In April 2014, Mitsui went aboard to New Zealand to study English. She would return one year later, upon announcement on her blog that she is writing English-language news and event reports for UP-FRONT LINK, UP-FRONT's international company news service.
On February 25, Mitsui accompanied Morning Musume '16 on their trip to Houston, Texas where they were main guests at Anime Matsuri 2016, which took place from February 26 to 28.
On July 5, she announced that she will be going back to New Zealand to further her English studies again.
On November 5, 2018, it was announced that Mitsui had terminated her contract with J.P. Room.

Ezra J. Mishan
(aka "
Edward
"; 15 November 1917 - 22 September 2014
[1]
) was an English economist best known for his work criticising
economic growth
. Between 1956 and 1977 he worked at the
London School of Economics
where he became Professor of Economics. In 1965, while at the LSE, he wrote his seminal work
The Costs of Economic Growth
,
[2]
but was unable to find a publisher until 1967.
[3]
In this work he expanded on his original 1960 thesis
[4]
which stated that the
“precondition of sustained growth is sustained discontent”
, warning developing nations that
“the thorny path to industrialisation leads, after all, only to the waste land of Subtopia”
.
[5]
The Costs of Economic Growth
presaged many of the concerns of the
Green movement
that followed.

Plot
[
edit
]
The Doctor and her companions, joined by ex-police officer Jake, video blogger Gabriela, and medical researchers Suki and Amaru, investigate a new bacterium infecting people in Peru, Hong Kong, and Madagascar. Those infected become covered by grey scales before their bodies explode. Birds in the local areas have also started acting aggressively towards humans.
The group finds Adam, Jake’s husband and an astronaut, is infected and held in a Hong Kong lab. While rescuing him, they are attacked by humanoids in biohazard suits. Yaz and Gabriela remain behind to investigate further while the rest go to Suki’s Madagascar lab via TARDIS to study Adam. Yaz and Gabriela see another humanoid use a panel to teleport somewhere and follow him, ending up in an alien-looking place.
The Doctor determines that the bacterium is drawn to
microplastics
that have saturated living beings, and that the birds’ natural enzymes are trying to fight it, causing them to become violent. As she generates an antidote, she realizes Suki’s lab is perfectly equipped for this task, and Suki reveals she is one of the remnants of an alien race ravaged by Praxeus, their name for the bacterium. When Yaz informs the Doctor of their discovery, Suki teleports away. After the birds kill Amaru on the beach and burst into the lab, the Doctor and the others flee to the TARDIS and subsequently to Yaz’s location. Adam volunteers as a test subject for the antidote, and the Doctor programs the TARDIS to synthesize more, should it be successful.
When they arrive, the Doctor determines that they are at the bottom of the sea in a shell of plastic made from the
Indian Ocean garbage patch
. They find Suki aboard her ship and learn that her kind came to Earth, rich in plastics, to study Praxeus and create their own antidote. When Suki demands the antidote from the Doctor, she is told that it will only work on humans. Suki suddenly succumbs to Praxeus and is killed. The Doctor finds that the ship runs on organic fuel, and with Adam successfully cured, has her allies load the batch of antidote into the ship and sets it on course to explode in the atmosphere to distribute it via the jet stream. The autopilot fails, however, and Jake stays behind to pilot the ship on its course, while the others retreat to the TARDIS. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to rescue Jake in the millisecond before the ship's destruction. With the cure successfully spread, the Doctor drops Jake, Adam, and Gabriela off, and Ryan suggests that they travel the world together.

Politics
[

Prior to 1988, Putnam County was a Republican Party stronghold in presidential elections, backing the Republican candidate in all but three elections from 1892 to 1984. From 1988 to 2012, the county consistently backed Democratic Party presidential candidates, but none fared better than Illinois resident
Barack Obama
's 56.9% in 2008. However, he failed to win a majority of the county's votes four years later despite winning it overall in his 2012 reelection bid. This foreshadowed what was to come in the 2016 election, as the county swung 21.8 points Republican to back
Donald Trump
over Illinois-born
Hillary Clinton
by a margin of 19.9%.

History
[
edit
]
Reproduction of the customs post
A statue of the
9th Earl of Desmond
welcomes visitors.
The castle was built as the
Customs House
for Kinsale about the year 1500 by
Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond
, following the grant of the customs of the port of Kinsale to the Earls of Desmond by
King Henry VII
in 1497.
[4]
Presumably there must have been an earlier structure on the site as the
1st Earl
was
Captain of Desmond Castle
.
It was used as a Customs House until 1641 when it was converted into a naval
prison
, following the construction of a new Customs House. The prisoners kept in the Castle were in the main French and Spanish, and the building became known locally as the "French Prison" as a result.

In January 1747, a fire broke out, killing 54 of the prisoners. In 1791, the castle was donated by
James Kearney
MP to the town of Kinsale, and it was subsequently used as a town gaol till 1846, and during the
Irish Famine
as a workhouse. In 1938, it was taken into government hands, and in the 1990s was restored and opened to the public by the
Office of Public Works
.

Biography
[
edit
]
McGeorge was born in
Dunedin
on 4 August 1868 to Scottish parents, James McGeorge and Isabella Crow.
[1]
McGeorge, along with his brothers John Crow and Joseph founded the Electric Gold Dredging Company in 1895, one of the most successful gold-dredging companies in New Zealand.
[2]
McGeorge's mother, Isabella Crow, and sister, Jane, were both signatories of the
1893 Women's Suffrage Petition
.
[3]
[4]
The McGeorge brothers' most famous gold dredge was the Lady Ranfurly, named by the then-present
Governor of New Zealand
,
Uchter Knox, 5th Earl of Ranfurly
after his own wife on a visit to
Cromwell
on 12 March 1898.

Alex McGeorge died in
Karitane
on 14 January 1953.

.
History
[
edit
]
The club was founded on April 1, 1937 and is the oldest on the island and was once the island's only club until 1948. It is one of the most titled teams in Sal regional division numbering 7.
The club participated 8 times in the national level.  Their greatest appearance was in the national finals where they lost to
Académica do Mindelo
in the 1989 edition. As Académico do Aeroporto won their only national title in 2003, Santa Maria qualified as a runner up in 2004, the club only had a draw and finished 5th with a point.  The club was next qualified as a runner up since the early 1990s.  Their recent appearance was in 2009 after winning their last championship title, the club also did not have a win but had two draws, a little better than five years later with six goals scored, the club finished 5th with 2 points.
The club won their only Super Cup title for Sal in 2009.  On December 30, 2016, Santa Maria won their first Association Cup/Opening Tournament title for the 2016-17 season in the island.
The club celebrated their 50th anniversary in 1987, the club celebrated their 75th anniversary in 2012.
[1]
In the 2016-17 season, Santa Maria started second place, after a win over Verdun in the 2nd round, the club was in the lead until a loss to Juventude on April 14 and became second which would be for the rest of the season.  On April 30, the final match of the season, Santa Maria made the highest scoring match in the region, where they defeated Gaviões 1-10.  Santa Maria finished with 29 points, two less than Académica do Aeroporto's, the club scored 40 goals, the most in the nation.
Santa Maria participated in the 2017-18 season with the island's association cup, placed first in Group A, they advanced to play into the
final match
and defeated
Académico do Aeroporto
1-0 at extra time to win their second straight title, the only scorer was Tchubasco. Santa Maria kicked off the 2017-18 Sal Premier Division with first place with three points, another win was made and a high scoring in two regional championship matches, they defeated
ASGUI
2-9 and is currently the region's highest of the season, the club is first place as of the third round as they recently defeated the island's most popular club Académico do Aeroporto, a repeat of what they did in the Opening Tournament final and contested to be the top three clubs of the island as the club is the first of the four participating historic clubs in the Premier Division. At round 4, they were first place, more than the other participating historic clubs of the island, two more than
Juventude
, three more than Académico do Aeroporto and five more than Académica do Sal. Santa Maria was one position ahead of Juventude. three ahead of Académico do Aeroporto and six ahead of Académica do Sal. Santa Maria is still first at the seventh round, midway in the Premier Division, as they did last season and has 19 points and has scored 24 goals, at that round, an unheard number over 17 last season. Their next win was 6-1 over Gaviões on January 21. A goal draw with Juventude was next, followed by another win over Florença Santa Maria, then a repeat of a goal draw, this time with ASGUI. Santa Maria lost to the powerful Académico do Aeroporto afterwards before a repeat of a goal draw, this time with Académica Sal on March 3. Santa Maria remains first place as of the 11th round. For two rounds from the 10th round, had equal points with Juventude, also they had 30 goals scored and seven wins, the latter the same with Juventude since the 10th round and Palmeira in the 11th round. In the 2017-18 Sal Island Cup, the club started at the first round where they defeated Oasis FC 3-1 in their first ever match with that club. Santa Maria had a bye week at the quarterfinals. In the semis, the club defeated Académico do Aeroporto and later became participant in the final. Santa Maria recently lost another Premier Division match, 1-3 to Palmeira and its first position. Santa Maria was second with 24 points, they were still the mastery in goals with 31 scored. Their points the same as Juventude's at round 12.

Diagrams representing dispersion in atmospheric waves
A
wavenumber-frequency diagram
is a
plot
displaying the relationship between the
wavenumber
(spatial frequency) and the
frequency
(temporal frequency) of certain phenomena. Usually frequencies are placed on the vertical axis, while wavenumbers are placed on the horizontal axis.
[1]
[2]
In the
atmospheric sciences
, these plots are a common way to visualize
atmospheric waves
.
In the
geosciences
, especially seismic data analysis, these plots also called
f
-
k
plot, in which energy density within a given time interval is contoured on a frequency-versus-wavenumber basis.  They are used to examine the direction and apparent velocity of seismic waves and in
velocity filter
design.
Origins
[
edit
]
In general, the relationship between
wavelength
λ
{\displaystyle \lambda }
,
frequency
ν
{\displaystyle \nu }
, and the
phase velocity
v
p
{\displaystyle v_{p}}
of a sinusoidal wave is:
v
p
=
λ
ν
{\displaystyle v_{\text{p}}=\lambda \nu }
Using the
wavenumber
(
k
=
2
π
/
λ
{\displaystyle k=2\pi /\lambda }
) and
angular frequency
(
ω
=
2
π
ν
{\displaystyle \omega =2\pi \nu }
) notation, the previous equation can be rewritten as
v
p
=
ω
k
{\displaystyle v_{\text{p}}={\frac {\omega }{k}}}
On the other hand, the
group velocity
is equal to the
slope
of the wavenumber-frequency diagram:
v
g
=
∂
ω
∂
k
{\displaystyle v_{\text{g}}={\frac {\partial \omega }{\partial k}}}
Analyzing such relationships in detail often yields information on the
physical properties
of the
medium
, such as
density
,
composition
, etc.

Portrait of Juan Manuel Cajigal y Odorado
Orphaned at age 7, he was raised in Spain by his cousin-once-removed,
Field Marshal
Juan Manuel Cajigal
, former
captain general
of Venezuela and
Cuba
. He studied in the
University of Alcalá de Henares
and later in France, finishing his studies in 1828. He returned to Venezuela that year. He helped found the
Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País
the following year, and in 1830 the government appointed him to create and direct the new
Military Academy of Mathematics
. He served in Congress twice, once in 1833 as representative of Caracas, and in 1835 as senator of Barcelona Province.  With José Hermenegildo García and Fermín Toro he started the newspaper
Correo de Caracas
, which ran from 1838 to 1841. His publications include
Tratado de mecánica elemental
("Treatise on Fundamental
Mechanics
") and
Curso de astronomía y memorias sobre integrales entre límites
("Course on

World War II
(
WWII
or
WW2
) or the
Second World War
was a
global conflict
that lasted from 1939 to 1945.
The
vast majority of the world's countries
, including all the
great powers
, fought as part of two opposing
military alliances
: the
Allies
and the
Axis
. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this
total war
, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources.
Aircraft played a major role
, enabling the
strategic bombing
of population centres and delivery of the
only two nuclear weapons
ever used in war. It was by far the
deadliest conflict
in history, resulting in
70 to 85 million fatalities
, mostly civilians. Millions died due to
genocides
, including
the Holocaust
, as well as
starvation
,
massacres
, and
disease
. In the wake of Axis defeat,
Germany
,
Austria
and
Japan were occupied
, and
war crimes
tribunals were conducted
against German
and
Japanese leaders
.
The
causes of the war
are debated; contributing factors included the
Spanish Civil War
,
Second Sino-Japanese War
,
Soviet-Japanese border conflicts
, the rise of
fascism in Europe
, and tensions in the
aftermath of World War I
. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when
Nazi Germany
, under
Adolf Hitler
,
invaded Poland
. The
United Kingdom
and
France
declared war
on Germany on 3 September. Under the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
of August 1939, Germany and the
Soviet Union
had partitioned
Poland
and marked out their "
spheres of influence
" across
Finland
,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
and
Romania
. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of
campaigns
and
treaties
, Germany conquered or controlled much of
continental Europe
, in a military alliance with
Italy
,
Japan
and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in
North Africa
and
East Africa
, and the
fall of France
in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and
British Empire
, with the war in the
Balkans
, the aerial
Battle of Britain
,
the Blitz
of the UK, and the
Battle of the Atlantic
. In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in
an invasion of the Soviet Union
, opening the
Eastern Front
, the largest land
theatre of war
in history.
Japan, which aimed to
dominate Asia and the Pacific
, was at war with the
Republic of China
by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous
offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific
, including an
attack on Pearl Harbor
which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The
European Axis powers declared war on the US
in solidarity. Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical
Battle of Midway
; Germany and Italy were
defeated in North Africa
and at
Stalingrad
in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the
Allied invasions of Sicily
and
Italian mainland
, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies
invaded German-occupied France
, while the Soviet Union
regained its territorial losses
and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944-45, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the
Japanese Navy
and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of
German-occupied territories
and the
invasion of Germany by the Western Allies
and the Soviet Union, culminating in the
Fall of Berlin
to Soviet troops,
Hitler's suicide
, and the German
unconditional surrender
on
8 May 1945
. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the
Potsdam Declaration
, the US dropped the first atomic bombs on
Hiroshima
on 6 August and
Nagasaki
on 9 August. Faced with imminent
invasion of the Japanese archipelago
, the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of
invading Manchuria
, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing
a surrender document
on
2 September 1945
.
World War  II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and set the foundation for the international order for the rest of the 20th century and into the present. The
United Nations
was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the
permanent members
of its
Security Council
. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival
superpowers
, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long
Cold War
. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the
decolonization of Africa
and
Asia
. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards
economic recovery and expansion
.

's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the
Pacific War
include the start of the
Second Sino-Japanese War
on 7 July 1937,
[3]
[4]
or the earlier
Japanese invasion of Manchuria
, on 19 September 1931.
[5]
[6]
Others follow the British historian
A. J. P. Taylor
, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.
[7]
Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the
Italian invasion of Abyssinia
on 3 October 1935.
[8]
The British historian
Antony Beevor
views the beginning of World War
II as the
Battles of Khalkhin Gol
fought between
Japan
and the forces of
Mongolia
and the
Soviet Union
from May to September 1939.
[9]
Others view the
Spanish Civil War
as the start or prelude to World War II.
[10]
[11]
The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the
armistice
of 15 August 1945 (
V-J Day
), rather than with the formal
surrender of Japan
on 2 September 1945, which officially
ended the war in Asia
. A
peace treaty between Japan and the Allies
was signed in 1951.
[12]
A 1990
treaty regarding Germany's future
allowed the
reunification of East and West Germany
to take place and resolved most post-World War
II issues.
[13]
No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,
[14]
although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the
Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956
, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.

History
Background
Main article:
Causes of World War II
Aftermath of World War I
The
League of Nations
assembly, held in
Geneva
,
Switzerland
, 1930
World War I
had radically altered the
political
European map with the defeat of the
Central Powers
—including
Austria-Hungary
,
Germany
,
Bulgaria
, and the
Ottoman Empire
—and the 1917
Bolshevik seizure of power
in
Russia
, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious
Allies of World War I
, such as France,
Belgium
, Italy,
Romania
, and
Greece
, gained territory, and new
nation-states
were created out of the
collapse of Austria-Hungary
and the
Ottoman
and
Russian Empires
.
[

To prevent a future world war, the
League of Nations
was created during the
1919 Paris Peace Conference
. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through
collective security
, military and
naval disarmament
, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.
[16]
Despite strong
pacifist
sentiment
after World War
I
,
[17]
irredentist
and
revanchist
nationalism
emerged in several European states in the same period. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the
Treaty of Versailles
. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all
its overseas possessions
, while German annexation of other states was prohibited,
reparations
were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's
armed forces
.
[18]
Germany
The German Empire was dissolved in the
German Revolution of 1918-1919
, and a democratic government, later known as the
Weimar Republic
, was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the
right
and
left
. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the
promises made
by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the
Fascist
movement led by
Benito Mussolini
seized power in Italy with a
nationalist
,
totalitarian
, and
class collaborationist
agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a
world power
, and promising the creation of a "
New Roman Empire
".
[19]

Adolf Hitler
, after an
unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government
in 1923, eventually
became the Chancellor of Germany
in 1933 when
Paul Von Hindenburg
and the Reichstag appointed him. Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself
Führer
of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a
radical, racially motivated revision of the world order
, and soon began a massive
rearmament campaign
.
[20]
Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance,
allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia
, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the
Territory of the Saar Basin
was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced
conscription
.
[21]
European treaties
The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the
Stresa Front
in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards
military globalisation
; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an
independent naval agreement
with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's
goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe
, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the
Franco-Soviet pact
was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.
[22]
The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the
Neutrality Act
in August of the same year.
[23]
Hitler defied the Versailles and
Locarno Treaties
by
remilitarising the Rhineland
in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of
appeasement
.
[24]
In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the
Rome-Berlin Axis
. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the
Anti-Comintern Pact
, which Italy joined the following year.
[25]
Asia
The
Kuomintang
(KMT) party in China launched a
unification campaign
against
regional warlords
and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in
a civil war
against its former
Chinese Communist Party
allies
[26]
and
new regional warlords
. In 1931, an
increasingly militaristic
Empire of Japan
, which had long sought influence in China
[27]
as the first step of what its government saw as the country's
right to rule Asia
, staged the
Mukden Incident
as a pretext to
invade Manchuria
and establish the
puppet state
of
Manchukuo
.
[28]
China appealed to the
League of Nations
to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being
condemned
for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in
Shanghai
,
Rehe
and
Hebei
, until the
Tanggu Truce
was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in
Manchuria
, and
Chahar and Suiyuan
.
[29]
After the 1936
Xi'an Incident
, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present
a united front
to oppose Japan.

Pre-war events

Main article:
Second Italo-Ethiopian War

Italo-Ethiopian War
, 1935
The
Second Italo-Ethiopian War
was a brief
colonial war
that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the
Ethiopian Empire
(also known as
Abyssinia
) by the armed forces of the
Kingdom of Italy
(
Regno d'Italia
), which was launched from
Italian Somaliland
and
Eritrea
.
[31]
The war resulted in the
military occupation
of Ethiopia and its
annexation
into the newly created colony of
Italian East Africa
(
Africa Orientale Italiana
, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the
League of Nations
as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations,
but the League did little
when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's
Covenant
.
[32]
The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.
[33]
Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing
Austria
.
[34]
Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)
Main article:
Spanish Civil War
When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the
Nationalist rebels
, led by General
Francisco Franco
. Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis did: altogether Mussolini sent to Spain more than 70,000 ground troops and 6,000 aviation personnel, as well as about 720 aircraft.
[35]
The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the
Spanish Republic
. More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the
International Brigades
, also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this
proxy war
as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War
II but
generally favoured the Axis
.
[36]
His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of
volunteers
to fight on the
Eastern Front
.
[37]
Japanese invasion of China (1937)

Second Sino-Japanese War
In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of
Peking
after instigating the
Marco Polo Bridge Incident
, which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.
[38]
The Soviets quickly signed a
non-aggression pact with China
to lend
materiel
support, effectively ending China's prior
co-operation with Germany
. From September to November, the Japanese attacked
Taiyuan
, engaged the
Kuomintang Army
around Xinkou
,
[39]
[

and fought
Communist forces
in Pingxingguan
.
[40]
[41]
Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek
deployed his
best army
to
defend Shanghai
, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back,
capturing the capital Nanking
in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were
murdered by the Japanese
.
[42]
[43]
In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their
first major victory at Taierzhuang
, but then the city of
Xuzhou
was taken by the Japanese
in May.
[44]
[
unreliable source?
]
In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by
flooding the Yellow River
; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at
Wuhan
, but the
city was taken
by October.
[45]
Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to
Chongqing
and continued the war.

Soviet-Japanese border conflicts
Main article:
Soviet-Japanese border conflicts
In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in
Manchukuo
had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and
Mongolia
. The Japanese doctrine of
Hokushin-ron
, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at
Khalkin Gol
in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War
[48]
and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a
Neutrality Pact
in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of
Nanshin-ron
, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.

European occupations and agreements

pictured just before signing the
Munich Agreement
, 29 September 1938
In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany
annexed Austria
, again provoking
little response
from other European powers.
[51]
Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the
Sudetenland
, an area of
Czechoslovakia
with a predominantly
ethnic German
population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain
and conceded this territory to Germany in the
Munich Agreement
, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.
[52]
Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to
cede additional territory
to Hungary, and Poland annexed the
Trans-Olza
region of Czechoslovakia.
[53]
Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939
secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy
to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939,
Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia
and subsequently split it into the German
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
and a pro-German
client state
, the
Slovak Republic
.
[54]
Hitler also delivered an
ultimatum to Lithuania
on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the
Klaipėda Region
, formerly the German
Memelland
.
[55]
Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the
Free City of Danzig
, the United Kingdom and France
guaranteed their support for Polish independence
; when
Italy conquered Albania
in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the
Kingdoms of Romania
and
Greece
.
[56]
Shortly after the
Franco
-
British
pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the
Pact of Steel
.
[57]
Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the
Anglo-German Naval Agreement
and the
German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact
.
[58]
The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August, when tripartite negotiations about a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom and Soviet Union stalled,
[59]
the Soviet Union signed
a non-aggression pact
with Germany.
[60]
This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet "spheres of influence" (western
Poland
and Lithuania for Germany;
eastern Poland
, Finland,
Estonia
,
Latvia
and
Bessarabia
for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.
[61]
The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War
I. Immediately after that, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.
[62]
In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen relations.
[63]
On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish
plenipotentiary
immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of
Danzig
, and to allow a
plebiscite
in the
Polish Corridor
in which the German minority would vote on secession.
[63]
The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30-31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador
Nevile Henderson
, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.

European theatre of World War II
On 1 September 1939, Germany
invaded Poland
after
having staged
several
false flag border incidents
as a pretext to initiate the invasion.
[65]
The first German attack of the war came against the
Polish defenses at Westerplatte
.
[66]
The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,
[67]
followed by
Australia
,
New Zealand
,
South Africa
, and
Canada
. During the
Phoney War
period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a
cautious French probe into the Saarland
.
[68]
The Western Allies also began a
naval blockade of Germany
, which aimed to damage the country's economy and the war effort.
[69]
Germany responded by ordering
U-boat warfare
against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the
Battle of the Atlantic
.
[70]
On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of
Warsaw
. The Polish
counter-offensive
to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the
Wehrmacht
. Remnants of the Polish army broke through to
besieged Warsaw
. On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a
cease-fire with Japan
, the
Soviet Union invaded Poland
[71]
under the pretext that the Polish state had ostensibly ceased to exist.
[72]
On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and
the last large operational unit of the Polish Army
surrendered on 6
October
. Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the
Polish government-in-exile
and a
clandestine state apparatus remained
in occupied Poland.
[73]
A significant part of Polish military personnel
evacuated to Romania
and Latvia; many of them later
fought against the Axis
in other theatres of the war.
[74]
Germany
annexed the western
and
occupied the central part of Poland
, and the Soviet Union
annexed its eastern part
; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to
Lithuania
and
Slovakia
. On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected,
[64]
and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France,
[75]
which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.
[76]
[77]

After the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened
Estonia
,
Latvia
, and
Lithuania
with military invasion, forcing the three
Baltic countries
to sign
pacts
that stipulated the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries. In October 1939, significant Soviet military contingents were moved there.
[79]
[80]
[81]
Finland
refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union invaded Finland
in November 1939,
[82]
and was subsequently expelled from the
League of Nations
for this crime of aggression.
[83]
Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the
Winter War
was modest,
[84]
and the Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with
some Finnish concessions of territory
.
[85]
In June 1940, the Soviet Union
occupied
the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,
[80]
and the Romanian regions of
Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region
. In August 1940, Hitler imposed the
Second Vienna Award
on Romania which led to the transfer of
Northern Transylvania
to Hungary.
[86]
In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded
Southern Dobruja
from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the
Treaty of Craiova
.
[87]
The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal
Ion Antonescu
with a course set firmly towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee.
[88]
Meanwhile, German-Soviet political rapprochement and economic co-operation
[89]
[90]
gradually stalled,
[91]
[92]
and both states began preparations for war.
[93]
Western Europe (1940-1941)
Main article:
Western Front (World War II)
German advance into Belgium and Northern France, 10 May - 4 June 1940, swept past the
Maginot Line
(shown in dark red)
In April 1940,
Germany invaded Denmark and Norway
to protect shipments of
iron ore from Sweden
, which the Allies were
attempting to cut off
.
[94]
Denmark capitulated after six hours
, and Norway was conquered within two months
[95]
despite Allied support
.
British discontent over the Norwegian campaign
led to the resignation of Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain
, who was replaced by
Winston Churchill
on 10
May 1940.
[96]
On the same day, Germany
launched an offensive against France
. To circumvent the strong
Maginot Line
fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of
Belgium
,
the Netherlands
, and
Luxembourg
.
[97]
The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the
Ardennes
region,
[98]
which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.
[99]
[100]
By successfully implementing new
Blitzkrieg
tactics, the
Wehrmacht
rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able
to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops
from the continent by early June, although abandoning almost all their equipment.
[101]
On 10 June,
Italy invaded France
, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.
[102]
The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and
Paris
fell to them on 14
June. Eight days later
France signed an armistice with Germany
; it was divided into
German
and
Italian occupation zones
,
[103]
and an unoccupied
rump state
under the
Vichy Regime
, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet, which
the United Kingdom attacked
on 3
July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.

[106]
The United Kingdom rejected Hitler's peace offer,
[107]
and the
German air superiority campaign
started in August but failed to defeat
RAF Fighter Command
, forcing the indefinite postponement of the
proposed German invasion of Britain
. The German
strategic bombing
offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in
the Blitz
, but failed to significantly disrupt the British war effort
[106]
and largely ended in May 1941.
[108]
Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy
enjoyed success
against an over-extended
Royal Navy
, using
U-boats
against British shipping
in the Atlantic
.
[109]
The British
Home Fleet
scored a significant victory on 27
May 1941 by
sinking the German battleship
Bismarck
.
[110]
In November 1939, the United States was taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies and amended the
Neutrality Act
to allow
"cash and carry"
purchases by the Allies.
[111]
In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the
United States Navy
was
significantly increased
. In September the United States further agreed to a
trade of American destroyers for British bases
.
[112]
Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.
[113]
In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an "
arsenal of democracy
" and promoting
Lend-Lease
programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort, which was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was
invaded
by Germany.
[107]
The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.
[114]
At the end of September 1940, the
Tripartite Pact
formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the
Axis powers
. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.
[115]
The Axis expanded in November 1940 when
Hungary
,
Slovakia
, and
Romania
joined.
[116]
Romania
and
Hungary
later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture
territory ceded to the Soviet Union
.
[117]
Mediterranean (1940-1941)
Main article:
Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II
In early June 1940, the Italian
Regia Aeronautica
attacked and besieged Malta
, a British possession. From late summer to early autumn, Italy
conquered British Somaliland
and made an
incursion into British-held Egypt
. In October,
Italy attacked Greece
, but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes.
[118]
Germany started preparation for an invasion of the Balkans to assist Italy, to prevent the British from gaining a foothold there, which would be a potential threat for Romanian oil fields, and to strike against the British dominance of the Mediterranean.
[119]

In December 1940, British Empire forces began
counter-offensives
against Italian forces in Egypt and
Italian East Africa
.
[120]
The offensives were highly successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The
Italian Navy
also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by means of a
carrier attack at Taranto
, and neutralising several more warships at the
Battle of Cape Matapan
.
[121]
Italian defeats prompted Germany to
deploy an expeditionary force
to North Africa and at the end of March 1941,
Rommel
's
Afrika Korps
launched an offensive
which drove back the Commonwealth forces.
[122]
In under a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and
besieged the port of Tobruk
.
[123]
By late March 1941,
Bulgaria
and
Yugoslavia
signed the
Tripartite Pact
; however, the Yugoslav government was
overthrown two days later
by pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both
Yugoslavia
and
Greece
, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.
[124]
The airborne
invasion of the Greek island of Crete
at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.
[125]
Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter and large-scale partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the
Axis occupation of Yugoslavia
, which continued until the end of the war.
[126]
In the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces
quashed an uprising in Iraq
which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled
Syria
.
[127]
Between June and July, British-led forces
invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon
, assisted by the
Free French

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations for war. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in
Southeast Asia
, the two powers signed the
Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact
in April 1941.
[129]
By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.

Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.
[131]
On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of
Ukraine
, the
Baltic states
and
Byelorussia
.
[132]
However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.
[133]
In November 1940,
negotiations took place
to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.
[134]
On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in
Operation Barbarossa
, with Germany accusing the Soviets of
plotting against them
. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.
[135]
The primary targets of this surprise offensive
[136]
[
]
were the
Baltic region
, Moscow and Ukraine, with the
ultimate goal
of ending the 1941 campaign near the
Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line
, from the
Caspian
to the
White Seas
. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate
Communism
, generate
Lebensraum
("living space")
[137]
by
dispossessing the native population
[138]
and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.
[139]
Although the
Red Army
was preparing for strategic
counter-offensives
before the war,
[140]
Operation
Barbarossa
forced the
Soviet supreme command
to adopt a
strategic defence
. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German
Army High Command
decided to
suspend the offensive
of a considerably depleted
Army Group Centre
, and to divert the
2nd Panzer Group
to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.
[141]
The
Kyiv offensive
was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further
advance into Crimea
and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the
First Battle of Kharkov
).
[142]

The diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the
Eastern Front
[143]
prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its
grand strategy
.
[144]
In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a
military alliance against Germany
[145]
and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the
Atlantic Charter
, which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world.
[146]
In late August the British and Soviets
invaded neutral Iran
to secure the
Persian Corridor
, Iran's
oil fields
, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or India.
[147]
By October, Axis
operational objectives
in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of
Leningrad
[148]
and
Sevastopol
continuing.
[149]
A major
offensive against Moscow
was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops
[150]
were forced to suspend their offensive.
[151]
Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet
capability to resist
was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The
blitzkrieg
phase
of the war in Europe had ended.
[152]
By early December, freshly mobilised
reserves
[153]
allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.
[154]
This, as well as
intelligence data
which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese
Kwantung Army
,
[155]
allowed the Soviets to begin a
massive counter-offensive
that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100-250 kilometres (62-155 mi) west.
[156]

in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American
gunboat
USS Panay
in 1937, and the 1937-38
Nanjing Massacre
,
Japanese-American relations deteriorated
. In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions, the
Export Control Acts
, which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.
[107]
[157]
[158]
During 1939 Japan launched its
first attack against Changsha
, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.
[159]
Despite
several offensives
by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and
occupied northern Indochina
in September 1940.
[160]
Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale
counter-offensive
in early 1940. In August,
Chinese communists
launched an
offensive in Central China
; in retaliation, Japan instituted
harsh measures
in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.
[161]
The continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces
culminated in armed clashes in January 1941
, effectively ending their co-operation.
[162]
In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during
Battle of Shanggao
.
[163]
[

In September, Japan attempted to
take the city of Changsha
again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.
[164]
[

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in
Southeast Asia
. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with some oil supplies from the
Dutch East Indies
, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.
[165]
In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.
[166]
[167]
At the same time, Japan was
planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East
, intending to capitalise off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.
[168]
Since early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.
[169]
At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.
[170]
Roosevelt reinforced
the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946)
and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".
[170]
The
USS
Arizona
was a total loss in the
Japanese surprise air attack
on the
American Pacific Fleet
at
Pearl Harbor
, Sunday 7 December 1941.
Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. Emperor
Hirohito
, after initial hesitation about Japan's chances of victory,
[171]
began to favour Japan's entry into the war.
[172]
As a result, Prime Minister
Fumimaro Konoe
resigned.
[173]
[174]
Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint Prince
Naruhiko Higashikuni
in his place, choosing War Minister
Hideki Tojo
instead.
[175]
On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the
attack on Pearl Harbor
to the Emperor.
[176]
On 5 November, Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war.
[177]
On 20 November, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.
[169]
The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.
[178]
That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;
[179]
[180]
the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.
[181]
Japan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.
[182]
[183]
To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the
United States Pacific Fleet
and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.
[184]
On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous
offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific
.
[185]
These included an
attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor
and
the Philippines
, as well as invasions of
Guam
,
Wake Island
,
Malaya
,
[185]
Thailand
, and
Hong Kong
.
[186]
The Japanese invasion of Thailand led to Thailand's decision to ally itself with Japan and the other Japanese attacks led the
United States
,
United Kingdom
, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.
[187]
Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States
[188]
in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.
[135]
[189]
Axis advance stalls (1942-1943)
On 1 January 1942, the
Allied Big Four
[190]
—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the
Declaration by United Nations
, thereby affirming the
Atlantic Charter
,
[191]
and agreeing not to sign a
separate peace
with the Axis powers.
[192]
During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate
grand strategy
to pursue. All agreed that
defeating Germany
was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward,
large-scale attack
on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.
[193]
Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.
[194]
At the
Casablanca Conference
in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the
unconditional surrender
of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.
[195]
Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.
[196]
Pacific (1942-1943)
Map of Japanese military advances through mid-1942
By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally
Thailand
had almost fully conquered
Burma
,
Malaya
,
the Dutch East Indies
,
Singapore
, and
Rabaul
, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.
[197]
Despite stubborn
resistance by Filipino and U.S. forces
, the
Philippine Commonwealth
was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.
[198]
On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the
Battle of Yenangyaung
and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.
[199]
Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the
South China Sea
,
Java Sea
, and
Indian Ocean
,
[200]
and
bombed the Allied naval base
at
Darwin
, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese
victory at Changsha
.
[201]
These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.
[202]
In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to
capture Port Moresby
by
amphibious assault
and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the
Battle of the Coral Sea
.
[203]
Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier
Doolittle Raid
, was to seize
Midway Atoll
and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to
occupy the Aleutian Islands
in Alaska.
[204]
In mid-May, Japan started the
Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign
in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.
[205]
[206]
In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken
Japanese naval codes
in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive
victory at Midway
over the
Imperial Japanese Navy
.
[207]
With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture
Port Moresby
by an
overland campaign
in the
Territory of Papua
.
[208]
The Americans planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern
Solomon Islands
, primarily
Guadalcanal
, as a first step towards capturing
Rabaul
, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.
[209]
Both plans started in July, but by mid-September,
the Battle for Guadalcanal
took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the
northern part of the island
, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the
Battle of Buna-Gona
.
[210]
Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and
withdrew their troops
.
[211]
In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first,
an offensive into the Arakan region
in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.
[212]
The second was the
insertion of irregular forces
behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.
[213]
Eastern Front (1942-1943)
Red Army

Battle of Stalingrad
, February 1943
Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in
central
and
southern Russia
, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.
[214]
In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the
Kerch Peninsula
and at
Kharkov
,
[215]
and then launched their main
summer offensive
against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the
oil fields of the Caucasus
and occupy the
Kuban
steppe
, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split
Army Group South
into two groups:
Army Group A
advanced to the lower
Don River
and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while
Army Group B
headed towards the
Volga River
. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.
[216]
By mid-November, the Germans had
nearly taken Stalingrad
in bitter
street fighting
. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an
encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad
,
[217]
and an assault on the
Rzhev salient near Moscow
, though the latter failed disastrously.
[218]
By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,
[219]
and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another
attack on Kharkov
, creating a
salient
in their front line around the Soviet city of
Kursk
.

[221]
By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive,
Operation Crusader
, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.
[222]
In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the
Gazala line
by early February,
[223]
followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.
[224]
Concerns the Japanese might use bases in
Vichy-held Madagascar
caused the British to
invade the island
in early May 1942.
[225]
An Axis
offensive in Libya
forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were
stopped at El Alamein
.
[226]
On the Continent, raids of Allied
commandos
on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous
Dieppe Raid
,
[227]
demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.
[228]
[
]
In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a
second attack against El Alamein
[229]
and, at a high cost, managed to
deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta
.
[230]
A few months later, the Allies
commenced an attack of their own
in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.
[231]
This attack was followed up shortly after by
Anglo-American landings in French North Africa
, which resulted in the region joining the Allies.
[232]
Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the
occupation of Vichy France
;
[232]
although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to
scuttle their fleet
to prevent its capture by German forces.
[232]
[233]
The Axis forces in Africa withdrew into
Tunisia
, which was
conquered by the Allies
in May 1943.
[232]
[234]
In June 1943, the British and Americans began
a strategic bombing campaign
against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and "
de-house
" the civilian population.
[235]
The
firebombing of Hamburg
was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.

After the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to
eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians
.
[237]
Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to
isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands
, and
breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands
.
[238]
By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also
neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk
in the
Caroline Islands
. In April, the Allies launched an operation to
retake Western New Guinea
.
[239]
In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in
central Russia
. On 5 July 1943, Germany
attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge
. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences,
[240]
and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.
[241]
This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies'
invasion of Sicily
launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the
ousting and arrest of Mussolini
later that month.
[242]
On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own
counter-offensives
, thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,
[243]
giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.
[244]
[245]
The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified
Panther-Wotan line
, but the Soviets broke through it at
Smolensk
and by the
Lower Dnieper Offensive
.
[246]
On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies
invaded the Italian mainland
, following
Italy's armistice with the Allies
and the ensuing German occupation of Italy.
[247]
Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by
disarming Italian forces
that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,
[248]
and creating a series of defensive lines.
[249]
German special forces then
rescued Mussolini
, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the
Italian Social Republic
,
[250]
causing an
Italian civil war
. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the
main German defensive line
in mid-November.
[251]

German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By
May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective
, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.
[252]
In November 1943,
Franklin D. Roosevelt
and Winston Churchill met with
Chiang Kai-shek
in Cairo
and then with Joseph Stalin
in Tehran
.
[253]
The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory
[254]
and the military planning for the
Burma campaign
,
[255]
while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.
[256]
From November 1943, during the seven-week
Battle of Changde
, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief.
[257]
[258]
[259]
[

In January 1944, the Allies launched a
series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino
and tried to outflank it with
landings at Anzio
.
[260]
On 27 January 1944,
Soviet
troops launched
a major offensive
that expelled German forces from the
Leningrad region
, thereby ending the
most lethal siege in history
.
[261]
The
following Soviet offensive
was
halted on the pre-war Estonian border
by the German
Army Group North
aided by
Estonians
hoping to
re-establish national independence
. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the
Baltic Sea
region.
[262]
By late May 1944, the Soviets had
liberated Crimea
,
largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine
, and made
incursions into Romania
, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.
[263]
The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on June 4.
[264]
The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions,
an operation against Allied positions in Assam, India
,
[265]
and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at
Imphal
and
Kohima
.
[266]
In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July,
[266]
and Chinese forces that had
invaded northern Burma
in late 1943
besieged Japanese troops
in
Myitkyina
.
[267]
The
second Japanese invasion
of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.
[268]
By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of
Henan
and begun a
new attack on Changsha
.

On 6 June 1944 (commonly known as
D-Day
), after three years of Soviet pressure,
[270]
the Western Allies
invaded northern France
. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also
attacked southern France
.
[271]
These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the
German Army units in France
.
Paris
was
liberated
on 25 August by the
local resistance
assisted by the
Free French Forces
, both led by General
Charles de Gaulle
,
[272]
and the Western Allies continued to
push back German forces
in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by
a major airborne operation
in the Netherlands failed.
[273]
After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but
failed to cross the Rur river
in a large offensive. In Italy, the Allied advance also slowed due to the
last major German defensive line
.
[274]
On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("
Operation Bagration
") that almost destroyed the German
Army Group Centre
.
[275]
Soon after that,
another Soviet strategic offensive
forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviets formed the
Polish Committee of National Liberation
to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish
Armia Krajowa
; the Soviet Red Army remained in the
Praga
district on the other side of the
Vistula
and watched passively as the Germans quelled the
Warsaw Uprising
initiated by the Armia Krajowa.
[276]
The
national uprising
in
Slovakia
was also quelled by the Germans.
[277]
The Soviet
Red Army
's
strategic offensive in eastern Romania
cut off and destroyed the
considerable German troops there
and triggered
a successful coup d'état in Romania
and
in Bulgaria
, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.

and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups

in
Greece
,
Albania
and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.
[279]
By this point, the communist-led
Partisans
under Marshal
Josip Broz Tito
, who had led an
increasingly successful guerrilla campaign
against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern
Serbia
, the Soviet
Red Army
, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint
liberation of the capital city of Belgrade
on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a
massive assault
against
German-occupied
Hungary that lasted until
the fall of Budapest
in February 1945.
[280]
Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans,
bitter Finnish resistance
to the
Soviet offensive
in the
Karelian Isthmus
denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a
Soviet-Finnish armistice
on relatively mild conditions,
[281]
although Finland was forced to
fight their former German allies
.
[282]
By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in
Assam
, pushing the Japanese back to the
Chindwin River
[283]
while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, Chinese forces
captured Mount Song
and reopened the
Burma Road
.
[284]
In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally
captured Changsha
in mid-June and the city of
Hengyang
by early August.
[285]
Soon after, they invaded the province of
Guangxi
, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at
Guilin and Liuzhou
by the end of November
[286]
and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December.
[287]
In the Pacific, U.S. forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their
offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands
and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the
Battle of the Philippine Sea
. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister,
Hideki Tojo
, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces
invaded the Filipino island of Leyte
; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the
Battle of Leyte Gulf
, one of the largest naval battles in history.
[288]
Axis collapse and Allied victory (1944-1945)
Yalta Conference
held in February 1945, with
Winston Churchill
,
Franklin D. Roosevelt
, and
Joseph Stalin
On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch
a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes
and
along the French-German border
to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at
Antwerp
to prompt a political settlement.
[289]
By 16 January 1945, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.
[289]
In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland,
pushing from the Vistula to the Oder
river in Germany, and
overran East Prussia
.
[290]
On 4 February Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the
Yalta Conference
. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.
[291]
In February, the Soviets
entered Silesia
and
Pomerania
, while the
Western Allies entered western Germany
and closed to the
Rhine
river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine
north
and
south
of the
Ruhr
,
encircling the German Army Group B
.
[292]
In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and to retake Budapest, Germany launched
its last major offensive
against Soviet troops near
Lake Balaton
. In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to
Vienna
, and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops
captured Königsberg
, while the Western Allies finally
pushed forward in Italy
and swept across western Germany capturing
Hamburg
and
Nuremberg
.
American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river
on 25 April, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.
Soviet troops
stormed and captured Berlin
in late April.
[293]
In Italy,
German forces surrendered
on 29 April. On 30 April, the
Reichstag
was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany,
[294]
and the Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May.
Major changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president,
Harry S. Truman
. Benito Mussolini
was killed
by
Italian partisans
on 28 April.
[295]
On 30 April,
Hitler committed suicide
in his
headquarters
, and he was succeeded by
Grand Admiral
Karl Dönitz
and
Joseph Goebbels
.
Total and unconditional surrender
in Europe was signed
on 7
and 8
May
, to be effective by the end of
8 May
.
[296]
German Army Group Centre
resisted in Prague
until 11 May.
[297]
In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the
Philippine Commonwealth
advanced
in the Philippines
,
clearing Leyte
by the end of April 1945. They
landed on Luzon
in January 1945 and
recaptured Manila
in March. Fighting continued on Luzon,
Mindanao
, and other islands of the Philippines until the
end of the war
.
[298]
Meanwhile, the
United States Army Air Forces
launched
a massive firebombing campaign
of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale. A devastating
bombing raid on Tokyo of 9-10 March
was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history.
[299]
Japanese foreign affairs minister
Mamoru Shigemitsu

In May 1945, Australian troops
landed in Borneo
, overrunning the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern
Burma
in March, and the British pushed on to reach
Rangoon
by 3 May.
[300]
Chinese forces started a counterattack in the
Battle of West Hunan
that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking
Iwo Jima
by March, and
Okinawa
by the end of June.
[301]
At the same time, a naval blockade by
submarines
was strangling Japan's economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces.
[302]
[303]
On 11 July, Allied leaders
met in Potsdam, Germany
. They
confirmed earlier agreements
about Germany,
[304]
and the American, British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan, specifically stating that "
the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction
".
[305]
During this conference, the United Kingdom
held its general election
, and
Clement Attlee
replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.
[306]
The call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms.
[307]
In early August, the United States
dropped atomic bombs
on the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement,
invaded Japanese-held Manchuria
and quickly defeated the
Kwantung Army
, which was the largest Japanese fighting force.
[308]
These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms.
[309]
The Red Army also captured the
southern part of Sakhalin Island
and the
Kuril Islands
. On the night of 9-10 August 1945, Emperor
Hirohito
announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the
Potsdam Declaration
.
[310]
On 15 August, the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio (
Gyokuon-hōsō
, literally "broadcast in the Emperor's voice").
[311]
On 15 August 1945,
Japan surrendered
, with the
surrender documents
finally signed at
Tokyo Bay
on the deck of the American battleship
USS
Missouri
on 2 September 1945, ending the war.
[312]
Aftermath
Defendants at the
Nuremberg trials
, where the Allied forces prosecuted prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of
Nazi Germany
for
crimes against humanity
Main articles:
Aftermath of World War II
and
Consequences of Nazism
The Allies established occupation administrations in
Austria
and
Germany
, both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, respectively. However, their paths soon diverged. In Germany, the
western
and
eastern occupation zones
controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949, with the respective zones becoming separate countries,
West Germany
and
East Germany
.
[313]
In Austria, however, occupation continued until 1955, when a joint settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted the reunification of Austria as a neutral democratic state, officially non-aligned with any political bloc (although in practice having better relations with the Western Allies). A
denazification
program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the
Nuremberg trials
and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.
[314]
Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories,
Silesia
,
Neumark
and most of
Pomerania
were taken over by Poland,
[315]
and
East Prussia
was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the
expulsion to Germany
of the nine million Germans from these provinces,
[316]
[317]
as well as three million Germans from the
Sudetenland
in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the
Curzon line
,
[318]
from which
2 million Poles were expelled
;
[317]
[319]
north-east Romania,
[320]
[321]
parts of eastern Finland,
[322]
and the three
Baltic states
were
annexed into the Soviet Union
.
[323]
[324]
Italy
lost its monarchy
,
colonial empire
and some
European territories
.
[325]
In an effort to maintain
world peace
,
[326]
the Allies formed the
United Nations
,
[327]
which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,
[328]
and adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
in 1948 as a common standard for all
member nations
.
[329]
The
great powers
that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the
permanent members
of the UN's
Security Council
.
[330]
The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes,
between
the
Republic of China
and the
People's Republic of China
in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its
successor state
, the
Russian Federation
, following the
dissolution of the USSR
in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.
[331]
Post-war border changes in
Central Europe
and creation of the
Communist
Eastern Bloc
Besides Germany, the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet
spheres of influence
.
[332]
Most eastern and central European countries fell into
the Soviet sphere
, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result,
East Germany
,
[333]
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Romania
,
Bulgaria
,
Czechoslovakia
, and
Albania
[334]
became Soviet
satellite states
. Communist
Yugoslavia
conducted a fully
independent policy
, causing
tension with the Soviet Union
.
[335]
A
Communist uprising in Greece
was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.
[336]
Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led
NATO
and the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact
.
[337]
The long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the
Cold War
, would be accompanied by an unprecedented
arms race
and number of
proxy wars
throughout the world.
[338]
In Asia, the United States led the
occupation of Japan
and
administered Japan's former islands
in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed
South Sakhalin
and the
Kuril Islands
.
[339]
Korea
, formerly
under Japanese colonial rule
, was
divided and occupied
by the Soviet Union in the
North
and the United States in the
South
between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the
Korean War
.
[340]
In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed
the civil war
in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to
Taiwan
in 1949.
[341]
In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the
United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine
and the
creation of Israel
marked the escalation of the
Arab-Israeli conflict
. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their
colonial empires
, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to
decolonisation
.
[342]
[343]
The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a
baby boom
, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.
[344]
The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of
industrial disarmament in Western Germany
from 1945 to 1948.
[345]
Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.
[346]
[347]
At the
Bretton Woods Conference
in July 1944, the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the post-war world. The agreement created the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), which later became part of the
World Bank Group
. The
Bretton Woods system
lasted until 1973.
[348]
Recovery began with the mid-1948
currency reform in Western Germany
, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the U.S.
Marshall Plan
economic aid (1948-1951) both directly and indirectly caused.
[349]
[350]
The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the
German economic miracle
.
[351]
Italy also experienced an
economic boom
[352]
and the
French economy rebounded
.
[353]
By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,
[354]
and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country,
[355]
it continued in relative economic decline for decades.
[356]
The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era,
[357]
having seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and exacted
war reparations
from its satellite states.
[b]
[358]
Japan recovered much later.
[359]
China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.

World War II casualties
Further information:
List of war crimes committed during World War II
World War II deaths
Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded.
[361]
Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about
20 million military personnel
and 40 million civilians.
[362]
[363]
[364]
The Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war,
[365]
including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths.
[366]
A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed.
[367]
Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.
[368]
An estimated 11
[369]
to 17 million
[370]
civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitler's
racist policies
, including
mass killing
of
around 6
million Jews
, along with
Roma
,
homosexuals
, at least 1.9 million ethnic
Poles
[371]
[372]
and
millions of other Slavs
(including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and
other ethnic and minority groups
.
[373]
[370]
Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic
Serbs
, along with gypsies and Jews, were
persecuted and murdered
by the Axis-aligned Croatian
Ustaše
in
Yugoslavia
.
[374]
Concurrently,
Muslims
and
Croats
were
persecuted and killed
by Serb nationalist
Chetniks
,
[375]
with an estimated 50,000-68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians).
[376]
Also, more than 100,000 Poles were massacred by the
Ukrainian Insurgent Army
in the
Volhynia massacres
, between 1943 and 1945.
[377]
At the same time, about 10,000-15,000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish
Home Army
and other Polish units, in reprisal attacks.
[378]
Bodies of Chinese civilians killed by the
Imperial Japanese Army
during the
Nanking Massacre
in December 1937
In Asia and the Pacific, the number of people killed by Japanese troops remains contested. According to R.J. Rummel, the Japanese killed between 3
million and more than 10 million people, with the most probable case of almost 6,000,000 people.
[379]
According to the British historian
M. R. D. Foot
, civilian deaths are between 10 million and 20 million, whereas Chinese military casualties (killed and wounded) are estimated to be over five million.
[380]
Other estimates say that up to 30 million people, most of them civilians, were killed.
[381]
[382]
The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the
Nanking Massacre
, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered.
[383]
Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the
Sankō Sakusen
. General
Yasuji Okamura
implemented the policy in Heipei and
Shantung
.
[384]
Axis forces employed
biological
and
chemical weapons
. The
Imperial Japanese Army
used a variety of such weapons during its
invasion and occupation of China
(
see
Unit 731
)
[385]
[386]
and in
early conflicts against the Soviets
.
[387]
Both the Germans and the
Japanese tested
such weapons against civilians,
[388]
and sometimes on
prisoners of war
.
[389]
The Soviet Union was responsible for the
Katyn massacre
of 22,000 Polish officers,
[390]
and the imprisonment or execution of
hundreds of thousands of political prisoners
by the
NKVD
secret police, along with
mass civilian deportations to Siberia
, in the
Baltic states
and
eastern Poland
annexed by the Red Army.
[391]
Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in
Germany
.
[392]
[393]
The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million,
[394]
while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.
[395]
[396]
The mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime, although no
positive
or specific
customary
international humanitarian law
with respect to
aerial warfare
existed before or during World War II.
[397]
The USAAF
bombed a total of 67 Japanese cities
, killing 393,000 civilians, including from the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
, and destroying 65% of built-up areas.

Nazi Germany
, under the
dictatorship
of Adolf Hitler, was responsible for murdering about 6
million Jews in what is now known as
the Holocaust
. They also murdered an additional 4
million others who were deemed "
unworthy of life
" (including the
disabled
and
mentally ill
,
Soviet prisoners of war
,
Romani
,
homosexuals
,
Freemasons
, and
Jehovah's Witnesses
) as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a "
genocidal
state".
[399]
Soviet POWs
were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million died in Nazi camps during the war.
[400]
[401]
In addition to
concentration camps
,
death camps
were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. Nazi Germany extensively used
forced labourers
; about 12 million
Europeans
from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.
[402]
The Soviet
Gulag
became a
de facto
system of deadly camps during 1942-43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates,
[403]
including foreign citizens of Poland and
other countries
occupied in 1939-40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis
POWs
.
[404]
By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to
NKVD
evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.
[405]
Japanese
prisoner-of-war camps
, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The
International Military Tribunal for the Far East
found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent (for American POWs, 37 percent),
[406]
seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians.
[407]
While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the
surrender of Japan
, the number of Chinese released was only 56.
[408]
At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the
East Asia Development Board
, or
Kōain
, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million.
[409]
In
Java
, between 4
and 10 million
rōmusha
(Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.
[410]
Occupation
Soviet partisans
hanged by the German army. The
Russian Academy of Sciences
reported in 1995 that
civilian victims in the Soviet Union
at German hands totalled 13.7 million dead, twenty percent of the 68 million people in the occupied Soviet Union.
Main articles:
German-occupied Europe
,

,
Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy
,
Collaboration with Imperial Japan
, and
Nazi plunder
In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the
annexed portions of Czechoslovakia
) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the
sizeable plunder
of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.
[411]
Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.
[412]
In the East, the intended gains of
Lebensraum
were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet
scorched earth
policies denied resources to the German invaders.
[413]
Unlike in the West, the
Nazi racial policy
encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "
inferior people
" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by
mass atrocities and war crimes
.
[414]
The Nazis
killed an estimated 2.77 million ethnic Poles
during the war in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
[415]
[

]
Although
resistance groups
formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East
[416]
or the West
[417]
until late 1943.
In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere
, essentially a Japanese
hegemony
which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.
[418]
Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination,
Japanese war crimes
frequently turned local public opinion against them.
[419]
During Japan's initial conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m
3
) of oil (~550,000 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (7,900,000 m
3
) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 percent of its 1940 output rate.

Allies to Axis GDP ratio between 1938 and 1945
In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.
[420]
In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.
[420]
The United States produced about two-thirds of all the munitions used by the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.
[421]
Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of
attrition
.
[422]
While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed
[
by whom?
]
to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the
labour force
,
[423]
Allied
strategic bombing
,
[424]
and Germany's late shift to a
war economy
[425]
contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.
[426]
To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of
slave labourers
;
[427]
Germany used
about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,
[402]
while
Japan used
more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.

(the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).
[429]
Anti-aircraft weaponry
also advanced, including defences such as
radar
and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the
proximity fuze
. The use of the
jet aircraft
was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.
[430]
Advances were made in nearly every aspect of
naval warfare
, most notably with
aircraft carriers
and
submarines
. Although
aeronautical
warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war,
actions at Taranto
,
Pearl Harbor
, and the
Coral Sea
established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship).
[431]
[432]
[433]
In the Atlantic,
escort carriers
became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the
Mid-Atlantic gap
.
[434]
Carriers were also more economical than
battleships
because of the relatively low cost of aircraft
[435]
and not requiring to be as heavily armoured.
[436]
Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the
First World War
,
[437]
were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. The British focused development on
anti-submarine
weaponry
and tactics, such as
sonar
and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the
Type VII submarine
and
wolfpack
tactics.
[438]
[

]
Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the
Leigh light
,
hedgehog
,
squid
, and
homing torpedoes
proved effective against German submarines.
[439]
Land warfare
changed from the static frontlines of
trench warfare
of World War I, which had relied on improved
artillery
that outmatched the speed of both
infantry
and
cavalry
, to increased mobility and
combined arms
. The
tank
, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.
[440]
In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War
I,
[441]
and
advances continued throughout the war
with increases in speed, armour and firepower.
[442]
[443]
At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.
[444]
This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.
[440]
Many means of
destroying tanks
, including
indirect artillery
,
anti-tank guns
(both towed and
self-propelled
),
mines
, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.
[444]
Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,
[445]
and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.
[446]
The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German
MG 34
, and various
submachine guns
which were suited to
close combat
in urban and jungle settings.
[446]
The
assault rifle
, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.
[447]

Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large
codebooks
for
cryptography
by designing
ciphering
machines, the most well-known being the German
Enigma machine
.
[448]
Development of
SIGINT
(
sig
nals
int
elligence) and
cryptanalysis
enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of
Japanese naval codes
[449]
and British
Ultra
, a
pioneering method
for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to the United Kingdom by the
Polish Cipher Bureau
, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.
[450]
Another aspect of
military intelligence
was the use of
deception
, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations
Mincemeat
and
Bodyguard
.
[449]
[451]
Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (
Z3
,
Colossus
, and
ENIAC
),
guided missiles
and
modern rockets
, the
Manhattan Project
's development of
nuclear weapons
,
operations research
, the development of
artificial harbours
and
oil pipelines under the English Channel
.
[452]
Penicillin
was first
developed, mass-produced and used
during the war.

włókas
and 4
morga
. The owner was to pay 10 marks of rent per year for the plot of land (vłóka). The colonization were strenuous since in 1714 the town was only half built up and an application was made for exemption from the established fees for the next few years in order to completely develop the area.

In the
United Kingdom
, the
Violent and Sex Offender Register
(
ViSOR
) is a
database
of records of those required to register with the police under the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
(the 2003 Act), those jailed for more than 12 months for violent offences, and those thought to be at risk of offending. In response to a
Freedom of Information request
in 2009, for example, Greater Manchester Police reported that of 16 people in their area placed on ViSOR since 2007 on their initiative and not as a result of a relevant conviction, four (25%) had clean criminal records.
[1]
The Register can be accessed by the
police
,
National Probation Service
, and
HM Prison Service
personnel. Private companies running prisons are also granted access.
[2]
It used to be managed by the
National Policing Improvement Agency
of the
Home Office
, but this was replaced by the
National Crime Agency
on 7 October 2013, as a feature of the
Crime and Courts Act 2013
, which also formally abolished the NPIA.
In April 2021, amendments were proposed to the
Domestic Abuse bill
to add serial domestic abusers and stalkers to the register, to give family court judges training on dealing with sexual abuse and to provide greater protection for migrant domestic violence victims. Despite the government suggesting support following the
killing of Sarah Everard
, all but two Conservative MPs voted down these amendments to the bill.
[3]
Notification period
[
edit
]
Notification periods for offenders sentenced under the 2003 Act are as follows:
[4]
Imprisonment for a fixed period
of 30 months or more,
imprisonment for an indefinite period
,
imprisonment for public protection
(abolished in 2012), admission to
hospital
under restriction order, or subject to an
Order for Lifelong Restriction
: Indefinitely
Imprisonment for more than 6 months but less than 30 months: 10 years
Imprisonment for 6 months or less, or admission to hospital without restriction order: 7 years
Caution: 2 years
Conditional discharge
or (in Scotland) a
probation
order: Period of discharge or probation
Any other: 5 years
Finite notification periods are halved if the person is under 18 when convicted or cautioned.
In April 2010 the
United Kingdom Supreme Court
ruled that indefinite notification requirements contained in
of the 2003 Act were a breach of individual human rights as they were disproportionate.
[5]
[6]
As a result of this, appeals against indefinite inclusion within the register were introduced. Appeals can be made to the local police force by an offender after inclusion on the register for 15 years. If the local police force declines to remove the offender from the register, they may appeal to a
magistrates' court
.
[7]
Information held on ViSOR
[
edit
]
Upon initial registration, offenders must provide the police with the following information:
Full name
Home address
Date of birth
National Insurance number
Bank details
Passport details (if held)
Additionally, when visited by
MAPPA
officers, they will be invited to, but need not, provide:
Employer's name and address
ISP details
Car registration
Telephone number(s)
Offenders must inform the police within three days if there are any changes in their name, address, bank details, passport or other ID document.
Offenders must also inform the police at least seven days in advance of any foreign travel
[8]
(it used to be only if it was for a period of 3 days or more), and they must register any addresses in the UK at which they stay for more than a total of 7 days within any 365-day period.
They must provide:
Date of departure;
Destination country (or, if there is more than one, the first);
Point of arrival in each country to which he/she intends to travel;
Carrier(s) he/she intends to use;
Return date;
Point of arrival on return to UK;
Accommodation arrangements for the first night.
Offenders must confirm their registration annually.
[9]
That is, if they have not needed to inform the police of any changes above, they must attend a designated police station to register if they have not done so for a year. Failure to comply is an offence, subject to a penalty of five years
imprisonment
.
On 13 August 2012, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Notification Requirements) (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 came into force. Under the new regulations, a subject on the Sexual Offenders Register is now required to provide the police with details of all bank accounts, credit cards, passport details and any foreign travel regardless of its duration. They are also required to notify to the police weekly if they are not registered as regularly residing or staying at one place. They also have to notify the police where they are living in a household with a child under the age of 18.
[9]
Development
[
edit
]
Construction of the ViSOR application began in January 2003, with a first release of functionality to a pilot site November 2003. The system was subsequently rolled out to a further three pilot sites during early to mid-2004. National (UK) rollout began November 2004, and was completed April 2005.
ViSOR is now in use across all 45 geographic police forces in the UK. Roll out to the
Prison
and
Probation services
of England and Wales was scheduled for 2006/7, but was considerably delayed and not completed until the autumn of 2008.
European Sex Offender Database
[
edit
]
MEPs
have shown support for a
European
Sex Offender Database.
[10]
In 2007 a
NSPCC
report suggested the failure of EU countries to share criminal records properly and was in their opinion "leaving children at risk in the UK."
[11]
In 2008 the High Court ruled that
permanent
inclusion on the register was disproportionate and incompatible with the
European Convention of Human Rights
.
[12]
A number of European countries such as Spain, Germany and Italy that in the past have stated
[

]
that sex offenders' registration as in the UK is a breach of the European Convention of Human Rights. France has implemented a national judicial sex offender database that has been adjudged to be legal by the European Court of Human Rights in the
Gardel v. France
decision.

Hayato Sakamoto
(
坂本 勇人
,
Sakamoto Hayato
, born December 14, 1988)
is a
Japanese
professional
baseball
shortstop
with the
Yomiuri Giants
of
Nippon Professional Baseball
(NPB).
In
2008
, Sakamoto became the first player in Giants franchise history to start a
season
opener while under the age of 20 since
Hideki Matsui
.
Early life and high school career
[
edit
]
Sakamoto was born in
Itami, Hyōgo
, and began playing baseball while in the
first grade
at Koyanosato Elementary School for the Koyanosato Tigers (a Little League team) alongside former
New York Yankees
pitcher
Masahiro Tanaka
. Ironically, Sakamoto was the team's
ace pitcher
, and Tanaka his
batterymate
on the team. Both Sakamoto and Tanaka went on to attend Itami Municipal Matsuzaki Junior High School, but Sakamoto opted to join Itami Senior, while Tanaka chose to play for the
Takarazuka
Boys.
Upon graduating from
junior high
, Sakamoto attended Kosei Gakuin High School in northern
Aomori Prefecture
, a baseball powerhouse in the
Tōhoku region
. He became the team's starting shortstop by the fall of his first year (the equivalent of
tenth grade
in the United States) at Kosei Gakuin High. Sakamoto was hitting
cleanup
by the summer of his second year (
eleventh grade
), and led his team to
runners-up
in the Tohoku Regional Tournament that fall, earning a berth in the 78th
National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament
that would be held at
Koshien Stadium
the following spring. He attracted the attention of
scouts
when he hit .813 (13-for-16) with four
home runs
in the Tohoku Regional Tournament later that spring, and hit a total of 39 home runs during his high school career.
The Yomiuri Giants picked Sakamoto in the compensatory first round of the
2006
NPB high school player
draft
after losing to the
Chunichi Dragons
in the lottery that was held for fellow shortstop
Naomichi Donoue
, the most coveted high school
position player
, and presented Sakamoto the
uniform number
61
.
Professional career
[
edit
]
In 2007, Sakamoto spent most of his
rookie
season (
2007
) with the Giants'
nigun
team (Japanese for "
minor league
" or "
farm team
"). He played 77 games in the
Western League
, hitting .268 with five homers and 28
RBIs
.
[4]
Sakamoto saw his first call-up to the
ichigun
(major
league
) team in July and made his
professional
debut as a
pinch runner
on July 12. He recorded his first career
base hit
and RBI on September 6, knocking in the game-winning
run
in a game against the Dragons.
[5]
In 2008,
Manager
Tatsunori Hara
had high hopes for Sakamoto in the
2008
season, playing him in all 15
pre-season
(spring training) games at either shortstop or
second base
. Although
Tomohiro Nioka
, then the Giants' starting shortstop, returned from injury just before their season opener, Sakamoto's quick adjustment to second base, accompanied by
left-hander
Masanori Ishikawa's taking the mound for the opposing
Tokyo Yakult Swallows
, prompted Hara to start him in the season opener as the
No. 8 hitter
on March 28. Sakamoto became the first Giant to start a season opener while under the age of 20 since former
New York Yankees
outfielder Hideki Matsui did so in 1994.
[6]
Although Sakamoto was expected to
platoon
at second base with the likes of veteran
journeyman
Kimura Takuya
and
speedster
Ryota Wakiya
throughout the season, he returned to his natural position when Nioka
tore
his right
calf muscle
in that very game. Sakamoto started at shortstop from the second game onwards and never gave up the starting job.
[7]
His first career home run came against the
Hanshin Tigers
on April 6, a
grand slam
off
reliever
Kenta Abe
that made him the youngest player in
Central League
history (19 years, 114 days) to hit a grand slam in a regular season game.
[8]
He was also voted to the
All-Star
team that year,
[9]
getting his first hit in an All-Star game in Game 2 held at
Yokohama Stadium
on August 1.
Sakamoto finished the season with a .257
batting average
, eight home runs, 43 RBI and 10
stolen bases
, contributing to the Giants' league title that year.
[10]
He made his first appearance in the
Japan Series
against the
Saitama Seibu Lions
on November 1, hitting a home run off veteran right-hander
Fumiya Nishiguchi
in Game 7
[11]
and becoming the first NPB player in 22 years to hit a home run in the Japan Series while being under the age of 20 (
Kiyohara Kazuhiro
last accomplished the feat while he was with the then-
Seibu Lions
). The Giants lost Game 7 3-2, coming up short in their run for a
Japan Series
championship.
Sakamoto also started all 144 games, becoming just the third player (and first in the Central League) to start every game of the season in one's second year out of high school (along with
Futoshi Nakanishi
and Kiyohara). Perhaps even more impressive was that if one were to include pre-season, All-Star,
Climax Series
(
playoffs
) and Japan Series games, Sakamoto played a grand total of 172 total games that year. Although the Central League Most Valuable Rookie award was presented to teammate and left-handed reliever
Tetsuya Yamaguchi
, who
went
11-2 with a 2.32
ERA
in 67
appearances
, Sakamoto received a special award for his efforts. The Giants also rewarded him by giving him the uniform number
6
.
[12]
In 2009, Sakamoto got off to a good start to the
2009
season (his third in the pros and second at the major league level), hitting .376 with a league-leading 11
doubles
and
slugging
.541 for the month of April. He continued his torrid streak into May, hitting multiple home runs (the second a game-winning solo shot off
closer
Kyuji Fujikawa
) in a single game for the first time on May 2 against the Tigers
[13]
and passing Tigers
slugger
Tomoaki Kanemoto
to take the league lead in batting average that week. He hit the first
walk-off home run
of his career on May 6 off reliever Hiroki Sanada (who was a teammate of Sakamoto until he was traded midway through the 2008 season) in a game against the
Yokohama BayStars
.
[14]
In 2015, Sakamoto was named captain of the Giants. He finished the regular season with a .269 batting average and 12 home runs, and for the first time since 2007 was not selected as an all-star. Sakamoto would bounce back in 2016, hitting .344 with 23 home runs and a .988 OPS, and was once again named an all-star. However, the Giants would miss the postseason for the first time since 2006.
In 2018, he was selected to his 10th
All-Star Series
[15]
and finished the regular season with a career-high .345 batting average.
In 2019, Sakamoto won his first
MVP award
. He finished the regular season with a .312 batting average, 40 home runs and 94 RBI,
[16]
and helped the Giants reach the
2019 Japan Series
.　However, the Giants were swept by the
Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks
in four games. Sakamoto collected just one hit in 13 at-bats during the series.
[17]
On June 3, 2020, it was announced that Sakamoto and Giants teammate
Takumi Ohshiro
both tested positive for
COVID-19
.
[18]
However, he was cleared to return to the starting lineup for the Giants'
2020 season
opener against the Hanshin Tigers on June 19. On November 8, 2020, Sakamoto collected his 2,000th career hit.
[19]
On September 7, 2023, Sakamoto started at third base for the first time in his 17-year career. Previously, he had only started at second base or shortstop.
[20]
International career
[
edit
]
As a member of the
Japan national baseball team
Sakamoto has participated in the 2012 exhibition games against
Cuba
,
2013 World Baseball Classic
,
2014 MLB Japan All-Star Series
, 2015 exhibition games against Europe,
2015 WBSC Premier12
, 2016 exhibition games against
Mexico
and
Netherlands
,
2017 World Baseball Classic
and
2019 WBSC Premier12
.
In the 2013 World Baseball Classic, he was the starting shortstop. Like most of his teammates, he had problems at the batting plate, as he was unable to hit for consistency during the pool rounds, though he had a crucial RBI single equalizer against
Chinese Taipei
in the bottom of the 8th of that game. Sakamoto seemed to regain his batting sense alongside his teammates in the 16-4 mulling of the
Netherlands
that qualified Team Japan to the semi-finals, hitting 2-5 in the game including a grand slam in the top of the 7th that gave Japan a more than 10 run lead needed to end the game early via mercy rule, securing an early ticket to the semis. However, Team Japan lost their semi-final match against
Puerto Rico
3-1, thus finishing third and losing their two-time defending championship streak.
On October 1, 2019, he was selected to participate at the 2019 WBSC Premier12.
[21]
On November 16, 2018, Sakamoto was selected for the Yomiuri Giants roster at the
2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series
exhibition game against MLB All-Stars.
[22]
Playing style
[
edit
]
Hitting
[
edit
]
Listed at 6 ft 1 in and  176 lb,
[23]
Sakamoto has a relatively large
frame
for a Japanese
middle infielder
. He is a
spray hitter
whose swing is characterized by a pronounced leg kick. Though the majority of his
extra-base hits
tend to be
line drives
into the
alleys
(37 doubles in 653 career
at-bats
as of May 13, 2009), many predict that Sakamoto will develop home run power as his body fills out.

Fielding
[
edit
]
Sakamoto puts his superb athleticism (he was clocked at 6.0 seconds in the 50-meter dash and 110 meters in the long toss in high school) to good use in the field. Though he committed 15 errors in the field in his first season in the majors in 2008, he has very good range and has improved on his throwing tremendously since coming into the pros.

in 1942.  While in the Army Air Corps (the predecessor to the
Air Force
), he was chief of the
Office of Strategic Services
's mission with
Tito's
Yugoslav partisans
for almost a year.
[2]
In 1946, Blatnik was elected to Congress representing Minnesota's 8th District in the northeastern part of the state, running on the newly unified ticket of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was reelected 13 times without much difficulty.  He served in the

) during his last two terms in Congress. As chairman, he shepherded the

The
Australian Music Examinations Board
(
AMEB
) is a federated, privately funded corporation which provides a program of examinations for music, speech and drama in
Australia
.
The organisation had its beginnings at the Universities of Melbourne and Adelaide in 1887 and later became a national body in 1918. It now has six state offices as well as a Federal Office in Melbourne. The Federal Board consists of representatives of educational institutions that are signatories to the AMEB constitution. These are the Universities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia, the Minister for Education and Training, New South Wales, the Minister for Education, Training and Employment, Queensland and the Minister for Education and Skills, Tasmania through the University of Tasmania. The AMEB is used to determine admission into the
Defence Force School of Music
in
Victoria
.
[1]
The AMEB consists of a federation of branches in Victoria,
[2]
New South Wales,
[3]
Queensland,
[4]
Western Australia,
[5]
South Australia and the Northern Territory
[6]
and Tasmania.
[7]
In addition, there is a National office whose board consists of a representative from each state board.
[8]
AMEB examinations are based on syllabuses set by the Federal Board in conjunction with the music and speech and drama community. AMEB produces a range of publications which support students and teachers preparing for exams.
AMEB offers syllabuses and examinations in a broad range of subjects including:
Music Teaching
Music Theory (Theory of Music, Musicianship, Music Craft)
Keyboard (Piano, Piano for Leisure, P Plate Piano, Organ, Electronic Organ)
Strings (Violin, Viola, Cello, Double Bass, Classical Guitar, Harp)
Woodwind (Recorder, Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon, Saxophone, Saxophone for Leisure)
Brass (Horn, Trumpet, Trombone, Bass Trombone, Tuba, Euphonium)
Brass Band Instruments (Instruments in B flat, E flat and C)
Percussion
Voice (Singing, Singing for Leisure)
Contemporary Popular Music (Keyboard, Vocal, Drum Kit, Guitar, Bass)
Musical Ensembles (Brass, Mixed, Percussion, Strings, Woodwind)
Speech and Drama
AMEB examinations cover a large range of skill levels; from a "Preliminary" grade suitable for very young children through to
academic degree
-level diplomas, including the
Associate in Music
(AMusA), the
Licentiate in Music
(LMusA), and ultimately the
Fellowship in Music
(FMusA), a diploma that is often conferred on an honorary basis to musical luminaries.
AMEB has recently introduced online examinations for music theory and online courses for Theory of Music.
In addition to the standard syllabuses, AMEB has a series of "for leisure" syllabuses for the piano, saxophone and voice which contain a repertoire of modern music. AMEB also has a Contemporary Popular Music (CPM) offering for Keyboard, Drum Kit, Guitar, Bass and Voice.

artificial intelligence
,
[9]
online advertising
,
search engine
technology,
cloud computing
,
computer software
,
quantum computing
,
e-commerce
, and
consumer electronics
. It has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world"
[10]

Alongside
Amazon
,
Apple Inc.
,
Meta
, and
Microsoft
, Google's parent company
Alphabet Inc.
is one of the five
Big Tech
companies.
Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists
Larry Page
and
Sergey Brin
while they were
PhD
students at
Stanford University
in
California
. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through
super-voting stock
. The company went
public
via an
initial public offering
(IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a
holding company
for Alphabet's internet properties and interests.
Sundar Pichai
was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.
[14]
The company has since rapidly grown to offer
a multitude of products and services
beyond
Google Search
, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (
Gmail
), navigation (
Waze
&
Maps
), cloud computing (
Cloud
), web browsing (
Chrome
), video sharing (
YouTube
), productivity (
Workspace
), operating systems (
Android

), music streaming (
YouTube Music
), video on demand (

), and more.
Discontinued Google products
include gaming (

),
Glass
,
Google+
,
Reader
,
Play Music
,
Nexus
,
Hangouts
, and
Inbox by Gmail
.
[15]
[16]
Google's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (
Sycamore
), self-driving cars (
Waymo
, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (
Sidewalk Labs
), and transformer models (
Google Deepmind
).
[17]
Google and YouTube are the two
most visited websites
worldwide followed by
Facebook
and
X
. Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by
Forbes
[18]
and fourth by Interbrand.
[19]
It has
received significant criticism
involving issues such as
privacy concerns
,
tax avoidance
,
censorship
,
search neutrality
,
antitrust
and abuse of its
monopoly
position.

Larry Page
and
Sergey Brin
in 2003
Google began in January 1996 as a research project by
Larry Page
and
Sergey Brin
when they were both PhD students at
Stanford University
in
California
.
[20]
[21]
[22]
The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder",
Scott Hassan
, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original
Google Search
engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;
[23]
[24]
Hassan went on to pursue a career in
robotics
and founded the company
Willow Garage
in 2006.
[25]
[26]
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.
[27]
They called this algorithm
PageRank
; it determined a website's
relevance
by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.
[28]
[29]
Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.
[23]
Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "
BackRub
", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.
[20]
[30]
[31]
Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google.
Rajeev Motwani
and
Terry Winograd
later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998.
Héctor García-Molina
and
Jeff Ullman
were also cited as contributors to the project.
[32]
PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for
RankDex
, developed by
Robin Li
in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine
Baidu
.
[33]
[34]
Eventually, they changed the name to
Google
; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word
googol
,
[20]
[35]
[36]
a very
large number
written
10
100
(1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.
[37]
Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in
HTML
, the
markup language
used for designing web pages.
[38]
Google was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from
Andy Bechtolsheim
,
[20]
co-founder of
Sun Microsystems
. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds.
[39]
[40]
Page and Brin initially approached
David Cheriton
for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to
Cisco
for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.
[41]
[42]
Google received money from two other
angel investors
in 1998:
Amazon.com
founder
Jeff Bezos
, and entrepreneur
Ram Shriram
.
[43]
Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.
[44]
[45]
Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in
Menlo Park, California
.
[46]
Craig Silverstein
, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.
[22]
[47]
[48]
After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,
[43]
a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,
[49]
with major investors including the
venture capital
firms
Kleiner Perkins
and
Sequoia Capital
.
[40]
Both firms were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.
[50]
Growth
In March 1999, the company moved its offices to
Palo Alto, California
,
[51]
which is home to several prominent
Silicon Valley
technology start-ups.
[52]
The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.
[53]
[22]
To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.
[54]
In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for
Yahoo!
, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing
Inktomi
.
[55]
[56]
Google's first production server
[57]
In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from
Silicon Graphics
, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in
Mountain View, California
.
[58]
The complex became known as the
Googleplex
, a play on the word
googolplex
, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.
[59]
By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "
google
" to be added to the
Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary
and the
Oxford English Dictionary
, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".
[60]
[61]
The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
.
[62]
Additionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire
Eric Schmidt
as the chairman and CEO of Google.
[46]
Eric was proposed by
John Doerr
from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company.
Michael Moritz
from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at
Novell
where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.
[63]
Initial public offering
On August 19, 2004, Google became a
public company
via an
initial public offering
. At that time
Larry Page
,
Sergey Brin
, and
Eric Schmidt
agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.
[64]
The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.
[65]
[66]
Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by
Morgan Stanley
and
Credit Suisse
, underwriters for the deal.
[67]
[68]
The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a
market capitalization
of more than $23 billion.
[69]
Eric Schmidt
, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011
On November 13, 2006, Google acquired
YouTube
for $1.65 billion in Google stock,
[70]
[71]
[72]
[73]
On March 11, 2008, Google acquired
DoubleClick
for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.
[74]
[75]
By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11
data centers
around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.
[46]
In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.
[76]
[77]
In May 2012, Google acquired
Motorola Mobility
for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.
[78]
[79]
[80]
This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,
[81]
mainly
Apple
and
Microsoft
,
[82]
and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.
[83]
2012 onward
In June 2013, Google acquired
Waze
, a $966 million deal.
[84]
While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and
Google Maps
, Google's own mapping service.
[85]
Google announced the launch of a new company, called
Calico
, on September 19, 2013, to be led by
Apple Inc.
chairman
Arthur Levinson
. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being" company would focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".
[86]
Entrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London
On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire
DeepMind Technologies
, a privately held artificial intelligence company from
London
.
[87]
Technology news website
Recode
reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price.
[88]
[89]
The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.
[90]
/ In 2015, DeepMind's
AlphaGo
became the first computer program to
defeat a top human pro
at the game of Go.
According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind
Apple Inc.
) in 2013,
[91]
2014,
[92]
2015,
[93]
and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.
[94]
On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a
conglomerate
named
Alphabet Inc
. Google became Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the
umbrella company
for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring,
Sundar Pichai
became
CEO
of Google, replacing
Larry Page
, who became CEO of Alphabet.
[95]
[96]
[97]
Current Google CEO,
Sundar Pichai
, with
Prime Minister of India
,
Narendra Modi
On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and "
Google's Ideological Echo Chamber
" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.
[98]
Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by "advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace", and he was fired on the same day.
[99]
[100]
[101]
Between 2018 and 2019,
tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated
as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment,
Dragonfly
, a censored Chinese search engine, and
Project Maven
, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company.
[102]
[103]
On October 25, 2018,
The New York Times
published the
exposé
, "How Google Protected
Andy Rubin
, the 'Father of Android'". The company subsequently announced that "48 employees have been fired over the last two years" for sexual misconduct.
[104]
On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.
[105]
[106]
CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.
[107]
Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.
[103]
On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a
cloud gaming
platform called
Google Stadia
.
[108]
On June 3, 2019, the
United States Department of Justice
reported that it would investigate Google for
antitrust
violations.
[109]
This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the
search
and
search advertising
markets.
[110]
In December 2019, former
PayPal
chief operating officer
Bill Ready became Google's new commerce chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with
Google Pay
.
[111]
In April 2020, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel.
[112]
Most employees were also working from home due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home
[113]
The
2020 Google services outages
disrupted Google services: one in August that affected
Google Drive
among others, another in November affecting
YouTube
, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.
[114]
[115]
[116]
In 2021, the
Alphabet Workers Union
was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.
[117]
In January 2021, the
Australian Government
proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.
[118]
In March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for
Ubisoft
ports on
Google Stadia
.
[119]
Google spent "tens of millions of dollars" on getting major publishers such as
Ubisoft
and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.
[120]
In April 2021,
The Wall Street Journal
reported that Google ran a years-long program called "Project Bernanke" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.
[121]
In September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.
[122]
In 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is "broadly useful", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.
[123]
In May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.
[124]
[125]
In early 2023, following the success of
ChatGPT
and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a "code red" and a "directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months".
[126]
In early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company’s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.

In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from
Google Photos
.
[130]
[131]
Google launched its

service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.
[132]
Google also hosts
Google Books
, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.
[133]
Google expanded its search services to include
shopping
(launched originally as Froogle in 2002),
[134]
finance
(launched 2006),
[135]
and
flights
(launched 2011).
[136]
Advertising
Google on ad-tech London, 2010
Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely
AdMob
,
AdSense
(such as AdSense for Content,
AdSense
for Search, etc.) and
DoubleClick
AdExchange.
[137]
In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology its acquisition of
DoubleClick
, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.
[138]
[139]
In 2007, Google launched "
AdSense for Mobile
", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.
[140]
Google Analytics
allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.
[141]
Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program.
Google Ads
allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.
[142]
The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.
[143]
One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of
click fraud
, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.
[144]
Google Search Console
(rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows
webmasters
to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.

[182]
[183]
Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company,
Google Fiber
was moved to Alphabet's Access division.
[184]
[185]
In April 2015, Google announced

, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.
[186]
[187]
Financial services
As a more mature company, Google has made many moves into financial services.
In August 2023, it became the first major tech company to join the
OpenWallet Foundation
, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.
[188]
Corporate affairs
Stock price performance and quarterly earnings
Google's
initial public offering
(IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.
[65]
[66]
The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a
market capitalization
of more than $23 billion.
[69]
The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,
[189]
primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the
online advertising
market.
[190]
The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and
mutual funds
.
[190]
GOOG shares split into GOOG
class C shares
and GOOGL
class A shares
.
[191]
The company is listed on the
NASDAQ
stock exchange under the
ticker symbols
GOOGL and GOOG, and on the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange
under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.
[192]
In the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.
[193]
[194]
[195]
For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.
[196]
In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.
[197]
Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year - not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."
[198]
Google's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.
[199]
Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.
[200]
By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.

Further information:
Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes
, and
Google tax
Google uses various
tax avoidance
strategies. On the
list of largest technology companies by revenue
, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through
Ireland
and the
Netherlands
and then to
Bermuda
. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.
[202]
This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's
transfer pricing
practices in 2012.
[203]
In 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US.
[204]
Google Vice-president
Matt Brittin
testified to the
Public Accounts Committee
of the
UK House of Commons
that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.
[205]
In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.
[206]
In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.
[207]
In 2013, Google ranked 5th in
lobbying
spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.

Google's logo from 2013 to 2015
The name "Google" originated from a misspelling of "
googol
",
[209]
[210]
which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on
PageRank
:
[32]
"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10
100
[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines." Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb "google" was added to the
Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary
and the
Oxford English Dictionary
in 2006, meaning "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet."
[211]
[212]
Google's
mission statement
, from the outset, was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",
[213]
and its unofficial slogan is "
Don't be evil
".
[214]
In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do the right thing".
[215]
The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.
The original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.
[216]
Since 1998,
Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first
Google Doodle
was in honor of the
Burning Man Festival
of 1998.
[217]
[218]
The doodle was designed by
Larry Page
and
Sergey Brin
to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-
intern
Dennis Hwang
to design a logo for
Bastille Day
in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".
[219]
Google has a tradition of creating
April Fools' Day
jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was
Google MentalPlex
which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.
[220]
In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called
TiSP
, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a
fiber-optic
cable down their toilet.
[221]
Google's services contain
easter eggs
, such as the
Swedish Chef
's "Bork bork bork,"
Pig Latin
, "Hacker" or
leetspeak
,
Elmer Fudd
,
Pirate
, and
Klingon
as language selections for its search engine.
[222]
When searching for the word "
anagram
," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"
[223]
Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author
technical documentation
better.
[224]
Workplace culture
Google employees marching in the
Pride in London
parade in 2016
On
Fortune
magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,
[225]
[226]
[227]
and fourth in 2009 and 2010.
[228]
[229]
Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index.
[230]
Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as "you can make money without doing evil," "you can be serious without a suit," and "work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun."
[231]
As of September 30, 2020,
Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees,
[232]
of which more than 100,000 worked for Google.
[8]
Google's 2020
diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%).
[233]
Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women.
[234]
In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019
.
[8]
Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range "from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six."
[235]
As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as
Innovation Time Off
, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail,
Google News
,
Orkut
, and
AdSense
originated from these independent endeavors.
[236]
In a talk at Stanford University,
Marissa Mayer
, Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.
[237]
In 2005, articles in
The New York Times
[238]
and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.
[239]
[240]
[241]
In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.
[242]
Google has also faced allegations of
sexism
and
ageism
from former employees.
[243]
[244]
In 2013, a
class action against
several
Silicon Valley
companies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.
[245]
In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their "conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race".
[246]
On January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced.
[247]
The coalition is made up of "13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Switzerland."
[248]
The group is affiliated with
UNI Global Union
, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.
[248]
[249]
[246]
Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.
[250]
In 2021 court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020 Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to "convince them (employees) that unions suck".
[251]

[253]
In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.
[254]
[255]
In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby
Chelsea Market
building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.
[256]
[257]
[258]
[259]
In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.
[260]
The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m
2
) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's
Hudson Square
neighborhood.
[261]
[262]
Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.
[263]
By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in
Ann Arbor, Michigan
.
[264]
In November 2006, Google opened offices on

[271]
Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the
Camden Council
in June 2017.
[272]
[273]

Further information:
Google data centers
Google has data centers in
North
and
South America
,
Asia
, and
Europe
.
[277]
There is no official data on the number of
servers
in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm
Gartner
estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.
[278]
Traditionally, Google relied on
parallel computing
on commodity hardware like mainstream
x86
computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.
[279]
[280]
[281]
In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.
[281]
Google has built its own private
submarine communications cables
. The first cable, named Curie, connects
California
with
Chile
and was completed on November 15, 2019.
[282]
[283]
The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020.
[284]
Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect
Lisbon
,
Portugal
with
Lagos
,
Nigeria
and
Cape Town
,
South Africa
.
[285]
The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in
New York, US
,
Bude
,
UK
and
Bilbao
,
Spain
, and is expected to become operational in 2022.
[286]
Environment
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of
solar panels
to provide up to 1.6
Megawatt
of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.
[287]
[288]
The system is the largest
rooftop photovoltaic power station
constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.
[287]
Since 2007,
Google has aimed for
carbon neutrality
in regard to its operations.
[289]
Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a
nuclear power plant
. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.
[290]
In 2010,
Google Energy
made its first investment in a
renewable energy
project, putting $38.8 million into two
wind farms
in
North Dakota
. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.
[291]
In February 2010, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.
[292]
The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.
[293]
In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.
[294]
In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy".
[295]
[296]
[297]
In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach
100% renewable energy
. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.
[298]
In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.
[299]
In September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998.
[300]
It also committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.
[301]
In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a
UL
2799
Zero Waste to Landfill
certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.
[302]
Climate change denial and misinformation
Google donates to
climate change denial
political groups including the
State Policy Network
and the
Competitive Enterprise Institute
.
[303]
[304]
The company also actively funds and profits from climate
disinformation
by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.
[305]
Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.
[306]
Philanthropy
Main article:
Google.org
In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.
[307]
The mission of the organization is to create
awareness about climate change
, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable
plug-in hybrid
electric vehicle
that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired
Larry Brilliant
as the program's executive director in 2004
[308]
and Megan Smith has since
replaced him as director.
[309]
In March 2007, in partnership with the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute
(MSRI), Google hosted the first
Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival
at its headquarters in Mountain View.
[310]
In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros to
International Mathematical Olympiad
to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011-2015).
[311]
[312]
In July 2012, Google launched a "
Legalize Love
" campaign in support of
gay rights
.
[313]
In 2008, Google announced its "project 10
100
" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.
[314]
After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,
[315]
Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.
[316]
Responding to the humanitarian crisis after the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine
, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.
[317]
The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.
[318]
Also in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits
Year Up
,
Social Finance
, and Merit America.

for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text.
(
April 2019
)
San Francisco activists
protest privately owned shuttle buses
that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.
Google has had criticism over issues such as
aggressive tax avoidance
,
[320]
search neutrality
,
copyright
,
censorship
of search results and content,
[321]
and
privacy
.
[322]
[323]
Other criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people's
intellectual property
, concerns that its
compilation of data
may violate people's
privacy
, and the
energy consumption
of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as
monopoly
,
restraint of trade
,
anti-competitive practices
, and
patent infringement
.
Google formerly complied with
Internet censorship policies of the People's Republic of China
,
[324]
enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "The
Great Firewall of China
", but
no longer does so
. As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of
virtual private networks
,
proxy servers
, or other similar technologies.
2018
In July 2018,
Mozilla
program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on
Firefox
.
[325]
[326]
In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of
Google Chrome
.
[327]
In August 2018,
The Intercept
reported that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as
Dragonfly
) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".
[328]
[329]
However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.
[330]
[331]
2019
In 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the
Reddit
online
community
/r/degoogle.
[332]
The
DeGoogle
grassroots campaign
continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.
In November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services
began investigation into
Project Nightingale
, to assess whether the "mass collection of individuals' medical records" complied with
HIPAA
.
[333]
According to
The Wall Street Journal
, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with
St. Louis
-based
healthcare
company
Ascension
.
[334]
2022
In a 2022
National Labor Relations Board
ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—
Project Vivian
—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.
[335]
2023
On May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-
disinformation
Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630
, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of
R$
1 million (2023) (
US$
185,528.76
) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.
[336]
[337]
Racially-targeted surveillance
Google has aided controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, sharing with police and military the identities of those protesting racial injustice. In 2020, they shared with the
FBI
information collected from all Android users at a
Black Lives Matter
protest in Seattle,
[338]
including those who had
opted out
of
location data collection
.
[339]
[340]
Google is also part of
Project Nimbus
, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and
Amazon
will provide
Israel
and
its military
with
artificial intelligence
,
machine learning
, and other
cloud computing
services, including building local
cloud sites
that will "keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines."
[341]
[342]
[343]
The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as their employees over concerns that the project will lead to further abuses of
Palestinians'
human rights in the context of the ongoing
illegal occupation
and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict
.
[344]
[345]
Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google "systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear," reflecting her view that the ultimatum came in retaliation for her opposition to and organization against the project.

Anti-trust, privacy, and other litigation
Main article:
Google litigation
The European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019
Fines and lawsuits
European Union
On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of
€
2.42 billion from the
European Union
for "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."
[347]
On July 18, 2018,
[348]
the
European Commission
fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed
[349]
that it had appealed the fine to the
General Court of the European Union
.
[350]
On October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to "non-public"
Google+
account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.
[351]
[352]
[353]
On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to "compete and innovate fairly" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by "imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.
[354]
[355]
On September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal over €4.125bn (£3.5bn) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google changed its policy.
[356]
France
On January 21, 2019, French data regulator
CNIL
imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's
General Data Protection Regulation
. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was "deeply committed" to transparency and was "studying the decision" before determining its response.
[357]
On January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body
CNIL
fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of
Cookies
along with
Facebook
.
[358]
United States
After U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,
[359]
and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October
[360]
the
United States Department of Justice
filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.
[361]
[362]
The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion-$12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones.
[363]
Later that month, both
Facebook
and Alphabet agreed to "cooperate and assist one another" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.
[364]
[365]
Another suit was brought against Google in 2023
for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market.
[366]
Private browsing lawsuit
See also:
Private browsing
In early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that
Chrome
's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.
[367]
[368]
The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges.
[369]
[370]
Reuters
reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO
Sundar Pichai
sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.
[371]
Gender discrimination lawsuit
In 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees  working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.
[372]
[373]
[374]
U.S. government contracts
Following media reports about
PRISM
, the
NSA's
massive electronic
surveillance program
, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.
[375]
According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as
YouTube
in 2010.
[376]
Google has worked with the
United States Department of Defense
on drone software through the 2017
Project Maven
that could be used to improve the accuracy of
drone strikes
.
[377]
In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO
Sundar Pichai
to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon.
[378]
Google ultimately decided not to renew this
DoD
contract, which was set to expire in 2019.

History
[
edit
]
High school education for Dunlap was started in 1893, and was a two-year course.  A new school building was built in 1899; the high school occupied the top floor of the frame structure, and afterward it became a four-year school. In 1934, the high school got a larger building, with rooms for the sciences, home economics, and the arts. In 1957, the school expanded further to meet the needs of a growing enrollment.
The Dunlap Athletic Association was founded in 1915, under the direction of the school's principal. Monthly membership dues of 5 cents helped fund basketball, tennis, and track teams at the high school. Football was eventually added to the school's activities.
Dunlap was District 105 until 1945 and District 302 from 1945 to 1969; it has been
Dunlap Community Unit School District 323
since 1969.
A new high school was built in 1976, with large spaces for home economics, industrial arts, a computer lab, a business department, chemistry and biology labs, music rooms, foreign language and English classes, mathematics, and fine arts. Along with the new school came updated athletic facilities, including a football stadium, an all-weather track, and a heated indoor pool.
In 2000, the most of the old high school was demolished, with the remaining classrooms and gym becoming "Dunlap District #323 Activity Center." The rest of the old high school grounds were dedicated in 2001 as Alumni Park.
[21]
Expansion
[
edit
]
In 2005, Dunlap underwent an addition of 10 new freshman classrooms, a new auditorium, an auxiliary gym, and music/art classrooms, it was completed in time for the start of the 2005-2006 school year.
In 2010, DHS added ten classrooms, including two computer labs and a science lab.
In 2011, the athletics facilities at the school were renovated at a cost of $5,000,000, including an artificial turf football field, new soccer and tennis complexes, and added concession stands.
Phase II of the renovation process began in mid December 2013 and included a two-story addition with an additional 17 classrooms, additional locker rooms, additional student lockers, cafeteria and kitchen expansions, new science labs, and a robotics lab. It was completed in time for the start of the 2014-2015 school year.
[21]
In September 1997, the newly redesigned and expanded Library was unveiled.
2018  saw the opening of a new press box for the on-campus baseball stadium named after former student Nicholas J. Murphy. The Nicholas J. Murphy Memorial Press Box was built at a cost of approximately $25,000, coming from donations. It saw its first action on March 21 for a game between Dunlap and
Notre Dame
.

Namogoo's cloud-based service, built on proprietary,
Machine Learning
technology, detects and blocks invasive content spread across ecommerce sites. This learning technology monitors and analyzes millions of web sessions from the server all the way to customer browsers — and based on pattern analysis techniques — classifies web activity and prevents it from running. Namogoo's proactive core engine leverages thousands of data points related to deep content inspection, statistical analysis, and indicative behavioral patterns in order to reach decisions. By identifying and blocking Customer Journey Hijacking activities that divert earned traffic and hurt conversion rates, ecommerce businesses are able to preserve the intended online experience and improve business metrics.

Customer Journey Hijacking
[
edit
]
Customer Journey Hijacking
[14]
is a rapidly growing phenomenon where unauthorized ads are injected into consumer browsers. Various injected ads include competing product recommendation widgets, banners, pop-ups, and in-text redirects which are inserted into the visitor's web session.
[15]
Ads are driven by digital malware that is downloaded through bad connections, free software bundles, and unsecured WiFi networks. This disrupts the intended online experience, and diverts earned web traffic away from ecommerce websites, cutting directly into their conversions and revenue. The majority of these injected ads redirect customers to competitor websites and promotions. Unsavory content is also featured across the site and impacts brand equity. Ad injections run on the consumer's browser and bypass server-side visibility or control over this activity.

in
Vlorë
,
Albania
. It is currently used mostly for
football
matches and is the home ground of
KS Flamurtari Vlorë
. The stadium has a capacity of 8.200 people.
[1]
Before the construction of the stadium,
Flamurtari Vlorë
played their home games on a field known as Varri i Halimit, which translates to Halimi's Tomb. The field was located near Uji i Ftohtë, which is where the club's training ground is located. The stadium was built in 1961 with an initial capacity of 6,500, and was expanded to 11,000 in 1975 following a reconstruction. During the club's golden era the stadium would attract crowds of up to 15,000 spectators and in 1987 when the club faced
FC Barcelona
in the
UEFA Cup
there was a crowd of 18,500, making it the ground's record attendance. Between 2004 and 2012, the ground was under recurring development with the aid of the
Albanian Football Association
which saw the ground converted into an
all-seater stadium
with a capacity of 8,200. In addition to the construction of the stands and the installation of seats, a new parking lot was built and floodlights were installed for the first time.
In February 2013, the new pitch was laid which was funded equally by the club and the Albanian Football Association and by the end of 2014-2015 season the stadium will be fully reconstructed and covered.

Introduction
Odes Part-I
A blaze is raging near His Throne
If the stars are astray
Bright are Thy tresses, brighten them even more
A free spirit I have, and seek no praise for it
What avails love when life is so ephemeral?
If my scattered dust turns into a heart again
The world is tospy—turvy; the stars are wildly spinning
O Cup—bearer! Give me again that wine of love for Thee
My Lord has effaced the gulf between His world and mine
Consuming fire for thee
Dost Thou remember not my heart’s first rapture
When flowers deck themselves into ruby bloom
My power of making music
I had believed my arena was under the starry heavens
Reason is either luminous, or it seeks proofs
O Lord! This world of Thine has a winsome face
Odes Part-II
Selfhood can demolish the magic of this world
Who sings this poignant song, blithe in spirit
The secret divine my ecstasy has taught
O myriad-coloured earth
Thou art yet region—bound
The dervish, in his freedom
The flowers are once more in radiant bloom
Muslims are born with a gift to charm, to persuade
It is love that infuses warmth into the music of life
With a heart unknown to a flame
The tongue and the heart
These Western nymphs
An illumined heart is supernal
Selfhood is daring in power, but has no pride
The leader is unworthy
Winter winds pierced me like a sharp sword
This ancient world
The way to renounce is
Reason is not far
Selfhood is an ocean boundless, fathomless
The morning breeze has whispered to me a secret
Thy vision and thy hands are chained, earth—bound
The only treasure reason has, is knowledge
Alexander’s burnished throne
Thou art not for the earth
In bondage of space
Reason has bestowed on me the eye of the wise
My plaint at last evoked
The sun, the moon, the stars
Every object has the urge
Is it a miracle,
Why should I ask wise men about my origin?
When the love of God teaches self—awareness
Explore the mysteries of’ fate, as I have done
This onrush of yearning
Let thy reason be close to nature
Alas! These men of church and mosque are known
Reason has devised again the magic of ancient days
Beyond the stars there are
The West seeks to make life a perpetual feast
Selfhood is Gabriel’s power
Does freshness of thought
As captured in a mirror
Sufis lack the fire, the passion that consumes
Intuition in the West was clever in its power
Cut the Gordian knot
Neither the power of kings
New worlds will he conquered
Arise! The bugle calls! It is time to leave!
The crescent has surpassed
Do not get engrossed In the dawning day and night
The training grounds of valour
Salman
the mellifluous
Kings and crowns and armies
Stanza: The style may not he vivid and lively, still
Quatrains
All potent wine is emptied of Thy cask
Make our hearts the seats of mercy and love
Estranging are the ways in the holy precinct
O wave! Plunge headlong into the dark seas
Am I bound by space, or beyond space?
I was in the solitude of Selfhood lost
Confused is the nature of my love for Thee
Faith survives in fire, like
Abraham
Observe the strains of' lily song:
My nature is like the fresh breeze of morn
A restless heart throb, in every atom
Thy vision is not lofty, ethereal
Neither the Muslim nor his power survives
Selfhood in the world of men is prophethood
Distracted are thy eyes in myriad ways
The beauty of mystic love is shaped in song
Where is the moving spirit of my life?
I am not a pursuer, nor a traveller
Thy bosom has breath; it does not have a heart
Pure in nature thou art, thy nature is light
Muslims have lost the passion of love they had
Conquer the world with the power of Selfhood
Dew—drops glisten on flowers that bloom in the spring
Reason is but a wayside lamp that gives
Give the young, O Lord, my passionate love for Thee
Thine is the world of birds and beasts, O Lord!
Thank Thee, O Lord, I am not without talent born
He is the essence of the worlds of space and spirit
Love is sometimes a wanderer in the woods
Love seeks sometimes the solitude of hills
Grant me the absorption of souls of the past
It was
Abul Hassan
who stressed the truth
This reason of mine knows not good from evil
To be God is to do a million tasks
So man is the powerful lord of land and seas!
The mystic's soul is like the morning breeze
That blood of pristine vigour is no more
The movement of days and nights is eternal, fast
Selfhood's apostate is the life of reason
Thy body knows not the secrets of thy heart

Guy I de Chabot, seigneur de Jarnac
(1514-1584) was a French courtier, soldier and governor. Rising to prominence with the elevation of his family to great office during the reign of
François I
, Jarnac became entangled with the great factions of court, and a marriage between himself and
Louise de Pisseleu
, the sister of the king's mistress, secured his centrality at court. That brought him into conflict with those around the dauphin,
Henri II
, and led to his famous duel with La Châtaignerie at the advent of the new king's reign.
After his victory in the duel, his family fell into disfavour in an act of revenge by his political opponents. However, he remained in personal favour and succeeded to the governorship of
La Rochelle
in early 1559. He struggled greatly with his
Protestant
co-religionists in the town, who did not share his enthusiasm for the authority of the crown. As a result, after assisting a coup during the first War of Religion, he found himself forced into exile from the town out of fear of assassination. Returning during peacetime, he again sought to stamp his authority on the town, which encouraged the king to make his will felt there. The king, however, began to tire of Jarnac's inability to bring the town to order cheaply and so exiled Jarnac from the town a second time by royal order in 1566. Once more of utility to the court, Jarnac was called to offer his services again in 1568 and attempted bring La Rochelle into order. Jarnac died in 1584.
Early life and family
[
edit
]
Guy I de Chabot, seigneur de Jarnac, had Charles I de Chabot as his father, who was governor of
La Rochelle
and
Bourdeaux
and was also mayor of La Rochelle.
[1]
His uncle
Philippe
was a childhood friend of
François I
, who became
Admiral of France
, governor of
Burgundy
and was afforded a marriage to
Françoise de Longwy
, a relation of the king.
[2]
Jarnac married
Louise de Pisseleu
, the sister of
Anne de Pisseleu
, the king's mistress in 1541.
[3]
Reign of François I
[
edit
]
The relations between the dauphin Henri and François were tested by the latent feud between Jarnac and La Châtaigneraie, both of whom represented one of the court's key factions.
[4]
Jarnac was a partisan of
Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly
, whose sister he had married. He lived an opulent life at court with his stepmother,
Madeleine de Puyguyon
's financial backing. As a result, rumours were spread by those in Henri's faction that he was having an affair with Madeleine.
[5]
Seeking to end the rumours, Jarnac filed a suit in the
Parlement
of Bourdeaux on grounds of defamation and challenged the king's childhood friend La Châtaigneraie to a duel to settle the matter. The king vetoed any duel at the urging of Anne, who feared the death of her brother-in-law.
[6]
Reign of Henri II
[
edit
]
Feud
[
edit
]
In the early months of the new regime, the feud between the two nobles boiled over. Jarnac, still incensed at the accusations of his relationship with his own stepmother, again accused those who created the rumour of lying. The assertion that the accuser had lied was an assault on aristocratic honour and necessitated a duel. While Henri's circle had originated the rumour, he could not partake in a duel due to his rank. As such, La Châtaignerie, a close childhood friend of Henri, stepped forth to take credit for the rumour. He requested permission from the king to duel Jarnac to the death, which was promptly granted. Jarnac seconded the permission by writing his own letters to the king for permission. In May 1547, the crown agreed that a duel could go ahead and provided a date for the combat of 10 July 1547.
[5]
[7]
Duel
[
edit
]
Jarnac chose as a second Claude de Boisy, a friend of
Anne de Montmorency
, and La Châtaigneraie selected
the duc de Guise
. Guise and Montmorency represented the new leaders of the aristocratic factions in Henri's reign. Jarnac, who had been expected by his patron to lose any duel, struck quickly and disabled his opponent at the leg. Victory achieved, Jarnacturned to the king, who was present, and asked him to declare his honour restored and accept the life of his opponent, which by the rules of aristocratic duels was in Jarnac's hands with his victory.
[5]
The king was shocked, caught off guard by the sudden defeat of his friend, and for a while said nothing. Eventually, at the urgings of Montmorency and his sister, he recognised Jarnac as the victor of the duel and freed him from the obligation to kill La Châtaigneraie. He would not, however, grant Jarnac the traditional words of respect that accompanied a duel victory.
[8]
Revenge
[
edit
]
When the king had calmed down, he embraced Jarnac, praising him for having 'fought like Caesar', La Châtaigneraie meanwhile, who was being tended to by a physician, tore off his bandages and allowed himself to bleed out, preferring death to dishonour.
[8]
He could not revenge on Jarnac without appearing vindictive, but when the
échevins
of La Rochelle caught wind of the changing political climate, Henri was petitioned to abolish the perpetual mayoralty of the city that Charles enjoyed and to restore the town council, which he promptly did in 1548.
[9]
When the
Italian Wars
resumed in 1551, Jarnac would serve the king, fighting under
Gaspard II de Coligny
during the siege of
siege of Saint-Quentin
in 1557 commanding 50 lancers.
[8]
In January 1559, Jarnac was assigned as governor of the strategic
Atlantic
city of La Rochelle. Jarnac was subordinate to the governor
Antoine of Navarre
and his lieutenant general
Charles de Coucis
. Despite his Protestantism, he remained loyal to the crown, which was a cause for tension between him and the Protestants of the city.
[10]
Reign of François II
[
edit
]
Upon the accidental death of Henri II during a joust in 1559, Jarnac was among Navarre's close advisers who advised him to go to court to assert his rights in the uncertain political climate that accompanied the new regime.
[11]
Reign of Charles IX
[
edit
]
It was not until 1561 that Jarnac was granted entry into the town as governor by the suspicious town council, which wished to confirm that his Calvinism was genuine. He would chastise the town's Protestants for disobeying the king's edicts but allowed an expansion in public Protestant services.
[12]
First War of Religion
[
edit
]
In early 1562, after the
Massacre of Wassy
, La Rochelle elected its first Protestant mayor. Jarnac, conscious that the situation in the town was deteriorating, wrote to
Catherine de Medici
and assured that her the majority of the town remained loyal to the crown despite several destabilising elements. He recommended a continued religious liberalisation to cool tempers in the town. With Condé's rebellion in April, elements of the town wanted to support the movement.
François III La Rochefoucauld
, who was in correspondence with elements inside the town, plotted a coup to seize control of the strategic centre, but the plan was foiled. Jarnac drove those loyal to him from the town with cannons.
[13]
Despite his loyalty to the crown, he struggled to enforce the orders that he received from court and protested that 'enforcing changing policies is very difficult to do here.'
[14]
Louis, Duke of Montpensier
, who was in charge of securing
Guyenne
for the crown, made common cause with Jarnac in the wake of La Rochefoucauld's aborted coup and agreed with Jarnac that he would smuggle troops into the town and assert the supremacy of the crown over the troublesome town authorities. On 26 October, Montpensier struck, overwhelmed the militia and brought the town under his command.
[15]
Jarnac's involvement in the countercoup shattered his credibility in the town's elites, and with threats of his assassination in the air, he fled the town on 3 November.
[16]
As a result, he found himself forced into exile from his governorship in much the same manner as
Claude de Savoie
in
Provence
.
[17]
Long peace
[
edit
]
With peace declared, Jarnac was afforded a return to the town. He chose as his lieutenant Amateur Blandin, a staunch royalist from the
Présidaux
court. The choice further alienated the suspicious grandees from Jarnac.
[18]
When Charles embarked upon his royal tour of France to investigate deviations from the
Edict of Amboise
and to enforce his authority on the troubled kingdom, Jarnac urged him to conduct an inspection of La Rochelle. The king obliged Jarnac and entered the town in September 1565. Montmorency, who was at the head of the advance guard, promptly confiscated all of La Rochelle's artillery. Informed by Jarnac of Protestant troublemakers in the town, Charles quickly implemented a series of decrees, designed to suppress dissent in the town.
[19]
Jarnac was granted the prerogative to choose from among the leading candidates which would become mayor. He was further granted all of the cannons that Montmorency had seized.
[20]
Fall from favour
[
edit
]
After the king had departed, Protestant worship resumed in the town. Jarnac remained in the town for a time, the threats against his life having increased to the point that he rarely left his house without twenty bodyguards. He wrote desperately to the court and pleaded for no reduction in funding for the
gendarmerie
in the town.
[20]
In 1566, conscious of economic pressures, Charles ordered Jarnac to disband his bodyguard, the crown no longer willing to pay for the security of La Rochelle's unpopular governor. He furthered that with a request for Jarnac to vacate the town and to turn over the arsenal to the mayor.
[21]
Jarnac protested strongly by reminding the king of the seditious nature of the Protestants in La Rochelle. Only when the lieutenant-general of
Poitiers
came to the town and read the kings order's directly to him would Jarnac at last quit the town.
[22]
Second War of Religion
[
edit
]
Reduced to sulking in his château, Jarnac turned on his lieutenant, Blandin, by opposing Blandin when he ran for mayor in the town on the grounds it violated the king's edicts. Charles, increasingly tired of Jarnac, ignored his protestations and confirmed Blandin as mayor.
[23]
When civil war resumed in 1568, the Protestants of La Rochelle seized the town and declared for Condé. Jarnac was ordered by the king to raise troops to bring the troublesome town back into obedience. The town, now under a Protestant junta led by Pontard, refused Jarnac when he tried to bring his garrison into the town, and he was unable to enforce his will on the well-defended town.
[24]
Jarnac died in 1584.

Branch railway line in New Zealand
Map
The
Walton Park Branch
was located in
Otago
,
New Zealand
and operated from 1874 until 1957, except for the first section, which survived until 1980.  It was adjacent to the
Fernhill Branch
and was, in the words of David Leitch and Brian Scott, essentially "an industrial service
siding
rejoicing in the status of a
branch line
."
[1]
Construction
[
edit
]
The line was built to serve coal mines and ran east from the
Main South Line
, with the junction at
Green Island
.  Construction commenced on 17 February 1874, and on 2 July 1874, it was open some 3.22 kilometres to
Walton Park
.
[2]
Five years later, a brief extension of 0.77 km was opened to
Saddle Hill
on 24 September 1879. The only structure associated with the branch built along its entire length was a shelter shed at Walton Park.
[1]
Operation
[
edit
]
The Walton Park Branch's operations were of little significance. A review in 1895 said the line was in good order, and nothing of any note occurred until the section from Walton Park to Saddle Hill closed on 24 July 1944.  This event in itself was so unremarkable that the railways annual report failed to mention it. After this stage, the branch was shunted only when required and did not even appear on the public timetable by 1950.  Coal traffic ceased seven years later and official closure occurred on 1 May 1957, though the first 0.58 km to Geddes was retained and used as a spur until 1 January 1980, and had necessitated the construction of an expensive underpass tunnel when the long drawn out construction of the
Dunedin Southern Motorway
began in the 1970s.
[1]
Today
[
edit
]
Very little remains of the Walton Park Branch. In 2000 the Southern Motorway extension was built over the formation to Saddle Hill.  Commercial and residential development has obliterated the rest of the old formation, though some is still visible from
State Highway 1
, a significant relic being the motorway underpass tunnel at
Green Island
. The rather unremarkable line is just as unremarkable in death as it was in life.

Born This Way
is the second studio album by American singer
Lady Gaga
, released by
Interscope Records
on May 23, 2011. It was co-written and co-produced by Gaga with other producers, including
Fernando Garibay
and
RedOne
, who had previously worked with her. She also worked with artists such as
E Street Band
saxophonist
Clarence Clemons
and
Queen
guitarist
Brian May
. Gaga and Garibay are the album's
musical directors
.
The music of
Born This Way
stems from the
synth-pop
and
dance-pop
styles of her previous material while incorporating different forms of instrumentation from that on her previous releases, such as
electronic rock
and
techno
. It features a broader range of genres, such as
heavy metal
,
disco
,
house
, and
rock and roll
, while its lyrical topics include sexuality, religion, freedom, feminism, and individualism. Despite divided opinions among religious and conservative commentators, the album was well received by music critics, who praised the varying musical styles and Gaga's vocals. Several music publications included the album in their year-end best-of lists.
Born This Way
received three
Grammy Award
nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for
Album of the Year
. In 2020,
Rolling Stone
included it in their updated list of the
500 Greatest Albums of All Time
.
Born This Way
debuted atop in various major music chart worldwide, including the US
Billboard
200
, where the record sold 1.108 million copies in its first week—the highest
first-week album sales
in five years; an estimated 440,000 copies were sold on
Amazon
in two days of its first week at a price of 99 cents. It has since been certified
quadruple platinum
by the
Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA). Four of the album's singles—
the title track
, "
Judas
", "
The Edge of Glory
", and "
You and I
"—charted in the top ten of the
Billboard
Hot 100
in the US, where "Born This Way" stayed atop for six weeks. At the time of its release, the title track was the fastest-selling single in
iTunes
history. The fifth single, "
Marry the Night
", charted within the top 30 in the United States. After going viral on the video sharing service
TikTok
, "
Bloody Mary
" was released as the album's sixth single in 2022, eleven years after its release. According to the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
(IFPI),
Born This Way
was the third global best-selling album of 2011. As of 2021, it had more than 5.8 billion global streams, 5.2 million physical copies sold, and 31 million digital tracks sold.
Gaga performed songs from the album on different occasions, such as the
53rd Annual Grammy Awards
and the
2011 MTV Video Music Awards
, as well as on worldwide television and in other events, including her third headlining concert tour, the
Born This Way Ball
(2012-2013). In November 2011,
Born This Way
, and its
remix album
,
Born This Way: The Remix
, were packaged as a compilation album titled
Born This Way: The Collection
. On June 25, 2021, Gaga released

, a special anniversary version of the album featuring six renditions of Gaga's songs by artists who are members or allies of the
LGBT
community.
Background and recording
Lady Gaga
released her first studio album,
The Fame
, in August 2008.
[3]
It received generally favorable reviews from critics and topped the charts in several countries.
[4]
[5]
After its worldwide success, a
reissue
of the album, titled
The Fame Monster
, was released in November 2009, which was also met with critical acclaim.
[6]
Gaga described them as
yin and yang
because of their contrasting styles and concepts.
[7]
In March 2010, Gaga disclosed that she was working on a new album, saying that she had written most of the songs for this project.
[8]
Meanwhile, producer
RedOne
described it as Gaga's "freedom album"
[9]
as her then-manager,
Troy Carter
, felt her public image would begin to change after its release.
[9]
A few months after, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I feel very strongly that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day."
[10]
She first alluded to
Born This Way
during a
SHOWstudio
interview in the same year, answering what she would call the movie of her life.
[11]
In another interview, she declared the album "the anthem of [this] generation," as she continued, "It includes the greatest music I've ever written. I've already written the first single for the new album and I promise you, that this album is the greatest of my career."
[10]
[12]
Born This Way
was written and recorded while in the midst of
The Monster Ball Tour
(2009-2011).

At the
53rd Annual Grammy Awards
, while accepting the award for

for

(2009), Gaga thanked Houston, "I wanted to thank Whitney because when I wrote 'Born This Way', I imagined she was singing it because I wasn't secure enough in myself to imagine I was a superstar. So Whitney I imagined you were singing 'Born This Way' when I wrote it. Thank you."
[31]
In May 2021, during the 10th anniversary of the album, she revealed that it was inspired by
Carl Bean
and his song "
I Was Born This Way
", released in 1977. On her social media, Gaga wrote, "
Born This Way
, my song and album, were inspired by Carl Bean, a gay black religious activist who preached, sung and wrote about being Born This Way."
[32]
[13]
The album contains mainly moderate-tempo dance songs, described by
MTV
's James Dinh as "anthemic style melodies with really sledge-hammering dance beats."
[33]
In the months prior to the release of

, Gaga characterized her new music as "something so much deeper than a wig or lipstick or a fucking
meat dress
" and upon hearing it,

[18]
[21]
Other themes referenced in the album include

,
equality
, and
freedom
.
[36]
Music and lyrical content
It's like Whitney, but imagine if Bruce Springsteen had a baby with Whitney Houston - that's what it is. And that was it! We made a baby. Finally. After all that fornication, miserably long and tedious,
Fernando
and I finally conceived.
—Lady Gaga, on "Marry the Night"
[37]
The standard edition of
Born This Way
includes 14 tracks;

Video of the Year
award, she announced the title of the album and sang the chorus of its title track.
[72]
Described by the singer as "a Christmas gift for my fans",
[73]
Gaga announced the release dates of the album and its lead single at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2011, via Twitter,
[74]
supplementing it with a black-and-white photograph in which MTV detailed that Gaga is "nude from the waist down, with her hair blowing about, and sporting a jacket with the name of the album emblazoned in what looks like bedazzled jewels."
[74]
At a November 2010 show of The Monster Ball Tour in
Gdańsk, Poland
, Gaga announced that the album could have up to twenty tracks,
[75]
adding that production for the album was coming to a close.
[76]
In an interview with
Vogue
in February 2011, she confirmed that there would be a total of seventeen tracks on the album, of which fourteen would make the final cut to the standard edition.
[77]
The other three songs were initially to be released on an exclusive deluxe edition of the album at

Minnesota Forward
.

Metro
.
[79]
Several non-singles songs were previewed as part of promoting

[83]
On April 17, 2011, Gaga tweeted her selection for the

, which featured the singer fused into a motorcycle. Gaga's name does not appear on the album cover - the only text is the chrome writing across the top reading the album's name.
[84]
She explained, "The cover with me half-female, half-motorcycle is meant to be or symbolic of the fact that I'm endlessly always changing in so transformative, many ways."
[85]
It was shot and had the artistic direction by photographer
Nick Night

The cover received a negative response from critics and fans. Sean Michaels of
The Guardian
expressed that the cover "[looked] more like a cheap
Photoshop
job than the most anticipated album of the year." He then commented, "Gone are the futurist sunglasses, the asymmetrical haircuts, even Gaga's newly touted magic horns; instead, a mutant motorbike with Gaga's arms and head, plus a cheesy chrome typeface." He also referenced several messages from fans on Gaga's official forum expressing their dislike for the cover.
[87]
The special edition cover was released on the same day: it features just Gaga's head from the standard edition cover but the words "Lady Gaga" and "Born This Way" appear in the top left corner of the cover. They are typed in

score of 71, based on 34 reviews.

said that "it's a damn good thing" that Gaga "doesn't know when to hold back" and complimented her for pushing musical boundaries to its "ultimate degree."
[17]
Sal Cinquemani from
Slant Magazine
opined, "There's nothing small about this album, and Gaga sings the shit out of every single track."
[225]
Cinquemani compared the album to
The Killers
' album
Sam's Town
(2006), calling it "bloated, self-important, proudly American, an exercise in extraordinary excess."
[225]
Rolling Stone
'
s
Rob Sheffield
felt that "the more excessive Gaga gets, the more honest she sounds."
[45]
Caryn Ganz of
Spin
felt that "excess is Gaga's riskiest musical gamble, but it's also her greatest weapon, and
Born This Way
relentlessly bludgeons listeners' pleasure centres".
[41]
Adam Markovitz of
Entertainment Weekly
said it is "rewarding but wildly uneven", although "the album's sprawl still shows off the breadth of her talent."
[221]
Despite criticizing her for "letting her skills as a songwriter slide ever so slightly,"
AllMusic
editor
Stephen Thomas Erlewine
complimented Gaga's composing "sensibility" and "considerable dexterity at delivering the basics."
[51]
In
MSN Music
,
Robert Christgau
viewed the album to not be on-par with
The Fame
(2008) or
The Fame Monster

[224]

Greg Kot
of the
Chicago Tribune
felt it was rushed and sounded like "a major artist sprinting to please everyone all the time."

called it "her weakest album to date" and wrote that it combines "some daring songwriting with some remarkably repetitive themes and beats."
[226]

[227]
Randall Roberts of the
Los Angeles Times
opined that Gaga lacks musical adventurousness and that "She's unsubtle in her message, unsubtle in her dress, and, most important, unsubtle aesthetically ... If Gaga had only spent as much time on pushing musical boundaries as she has social ones,
Born This Way
would have been a lot more successful."
[47]
Andy Gill of
The Independent
critiqued that "the broader [Gaga] spreads her net musically, the less distinctive her art becomes."
[223]
The Boston Globe
said that the songwriting "feels thin" and called the album "the most deflated moment in pop music this year".
[228]
The Village Voice
'
s Rich Juzwiak commented that Gaga's "we-shall-overcome sentiment" is expressed more effectively through the album's "egalitarian use of house beats" than through her "sloganeering", which he found "trite" and "[un]insightful."
[229]

the 11th greatest album of all time by a female artist.
[278]
The same publication later included it in their 2020 update of the
500 Greatest Albums of All Time
, on the 484th spot.
[279]
The album was ranked number 1 on
NME
'
s list of The 10 Most Pretentious Albums Ever.
[280]
Impact
Born This Way
'
s themes of acceptance, sexual orientation, gender identity and intersectional feminism have been of discussion for the past decade (2010s). Nicole Froio from
Harper's Bazaar
stated that "
Born This Way
marked a new era of
queer
music and performance." She argued that the album is "a pop record, but also a manifestation [...] of queer self-discovery," where Gaga explores her life events "through queer lens", opting for a "transcendent rather than static version of the truth". She also marked the album's "musical transgressions" —pop, opera, heavy metal, disco, house, and rock and roll— as "attractive to a queer audience," further explaining that "this kind of pop music is an artistic expression of certain aspects of queerness, a kind of expression that says, 'We can go beyond these tired boundaries we were taught are right'."
[281]
James Rettig from
Stereogum
said that Gaga "wanted [her legacy] to be one of acceptance, specifically for the
LGBT
Q community" and described the album as "a beacon of hope for so many".
[282]
R.S. from
Vulture
opined that "with
Born This Way
, Gaga chose to recast pop as a safe space for vulnerable, misfit, queer kids to find their individuality and reinvent the world in their image."
[71]
People holding signs written "Born This Way" during
pride parades
around the world
In an interview with
Billboard
, Gaga said "I want to write my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors," in regards to the literal, straightforward style of the album's lyricism. "I want it to be an attack, an assault on the issue, because I think, especially in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play."
[283]
Spencer Kornhaber from
The Atlantic
agreed with Gaga's claims and argued that "queerness became more visible than ever". He described "
Barack Obama
's first years in office" as a "renewed period of forthright political engagement," while linking the release of
Born This Way
with the creation of the
MTV Video Music Award for Best Video with a Message
in 2011, of which "Born This Way" was its first winner.
[284]
[285]
Christopher Rosa from
Glamour
compared the title track to
gay anthems
such as
Christina Aguilera
's "
Beautiful
" and
Katy Perry
's "
Firework
", arguing that "they weren't lyrically explicit" and that anyone could relate to them regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, unlike "Born This Way", "a song specifically for LGBTQ people [...] that came at a time when discussions about gay teen suicide were reaching all-time highs."
[286]
Writing a retrospective of events after the album's release after five years, Jake Hall form
Dazed
called
Born This Way
a "misunderstood masterpiece", complimenting its "deliberately literal lyrics" in songs such as "Heavy Metal Lover", "Hair" and "Scheiße". Noticing that it "represents the point in Gaga's career when she deliberately stopped studying her own fame and tried to use it to further her own message", he claimed
Born This Way
as her "most ambitious musical project to date."
[287]
Marni Zipper from
Audacy
stated that the album "cemented the singer as a cultural, musical and fashion icon," while also claiming that its campaign, specifically the music video for "Judas", "[distorted] how Popstars ultimately used fashion to express 'eras' in music."
[288]
Born This Way
has also been noted for bringing
electronic dance music
into the mainstream.
[289]
[290]
In May 2021, the
City of West Hollywood
declared May 23 as the
Born This Way
Day in recognition of the album's cultural impact.
[291]
A street painting of the album's title and
Daniel Quasar
's re-designed version of the
gay flag
(which includes trans and queer people of color) has been made on
Robertson Boulevard
, while the
key of the city
was awarded to Gaga.
Mayor
Lindsey P. Horvath
said Gaga "has become a cultural icon for our generation [...] through her music and activism," and also thanked her for "encouraging us to love ourselves and be proud." Gaga attended the ceremony wearing a
Born This Way
t-shirt from her own collection and thanked the LGBT community for "[being] the motherfucking key to my heart for a long time [...] I'll honor this and I'll cherish this, and I promise that I'll always be here for this day to celebrate with you."
[292]
[293]
In September 2021, during a marketing campaign, Spotify sponsored nine highways across the United States and named them after iconic songs with billboards, in which they included "Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)" in New York City.
[294]
On December 13, 2022, after
Joe Biden
, the president of the United States, signed the
Respect for Marriage Act
into law at the
White House
, "Born This Way" started playing immediately as planned.
[295]
Religious criticism controversy
Several religious groups have condemned the album for its incorporation of several religious icons of Christianity and its stance on sexuality. In
Lebanon
,
Born This Way
was temporarily banned by the General Secretary Department, who deemed the album to be in bad taste and mocking of Christianity.
[296]
Abdo Abu Kassm, director of the Catholic Information Center of Lebanon, highly criticized the themes of the album, expressing that "if they are going to offend us we are going to cancel the album."
[297]
He continued, "We will not accept that anyone insult the
Virgin Mary
or Jesus or Christianity [...]. Call us traditional, call us backward, call us whatever you want. We will not accept it."
[297]
This ban lasted up until June 9.
[296]
The music video of "Judas" was criticized by
William Anthony Donohue
, the president of the
Catholic League
, notably for Gaga's portrayal of Mary Magdalene. In an interview with HollywoodLife.com, Donohue expressed discontent towards Gaga's focus on Judas and Mary Magdalene, calling her "increasingly irrelevant" compared to people with "real talent", and attacked her for seemingly purposefully debuting the song and video close to
Holy Week
and
Easter
.
[298]
Shortly after its release, "Judas" was banned in Lebanon.
[299]
In
Malaysia
, where homosexuality is considered a criminal offense, the government criticized the album for its stance on sexuality and feminism.
[300]
Shortly after the release of the title track, radio stations across the country edited out several lyrics of the song as ordered by the Malaysian government.
[301]
Rosnah Ismail, the vice-chancellor of
Universiti Malaysia Sabah
, condemned the song, opining, "Islam forbids this. We have to abide by the country's laws."

Lady Gaga
's second studio album
Born This Way
(2011). Released on June 25, 2021, by
Interscope
, it features "six reimaginings of the album's songs by artists representing and advocating for the
LGBTQIA+
community."
[408]
Background and release
On May 28, 2021, five days after the album's tenth anniversary, Gaga announced
Born This Way The Tenth Anniversary
. She originally announced that the reissue would be released on June 18, however, it was delayed by a week due to unknown reasons.
[409]
The album was officially released on June 25, 2021 through streaming and digital download, while on CD and
cassette
on September 3, 2021. Its LP version became available on December 10, 2021.
[410]
The
Tenth Anniversary
version includes the album's original 14 tracks and an additional disc with six covers by artists representative of the LGBT community. A rendition of "Judas" by American rapper
Big Freedia
was released as the first single on May 28, 2021. Exclusive merchandise celebrating the album's tenth anniversary was also announced.
[411]
Three more singles were released prior the album's debut, "Born This Way" (The Country Road Version) by
Orville Peck
on June 4,
[412]
"Marry the Night" by
Kylie Minogue
on June 11,
[409]
and "The Edge of Glory" by
Years & Years
on June 22.
[413]
On June 8, Gaga's beauty brand,
Haus Labs
, launched the Bad Kid Vault, a limited-edition makeup box set including 16 products.
[414]
Critical reception
Writing for
Pitchfork
, Owen Myers praised the album with a rating of 7.9 out of 10. He called it "an enormous, bravura flex of electronic pop", while stating that "on her best front-to-back album, Gaga belts each crushing hook with every fiber of her chest, with personal pain turned into placard-ready manifestos. She sings like she's making a blood pact."
[415]
Mike Wass of
Variety
thought
The Tenth Anniversary
's
bonus disc "sounds a little scattershot", and opined that it was a missed opportunity to include new versions of album tracks "Bad Kids" and "Government Hooker". He added that "where the reissue really succeeds is in reminding us that great pop music challenges the status quo and shines a light on broader issues."
[416]

Background
[
edit
]
文明在進化 然而我們始終帶著原始的獸性
平地上  人們築起萬丈高樓
不過是一座座  摩天動物園
City Zoo
is an album that fully realizes G.E.M.'s vision from the concept of the album from song to song creation, music production, visual creativity, and event planning and promotion. The album starts from the human nature she has experienced in the past, turning her observation and care into lyrics. Each song uses metaphorical methods to convey the status of interpersonal relationships or
social phenomena
through an animal image.
[3]
Music and lyrics
[
edit
]
The album begins with the album title track, which incorporates a large number of hip-hop arrangements,
[4]
Describe the living postures of various animals, and reflect social phenomena, and sneer at the dark side that everyone may appear at some moment and hope that everyone can clear the temptation of false lies with the clearest vision and make the best choice.
The second track "Fly Away" is a very melancholy song, and the symbolic animal is
owl
. Through this song, G.E.M. hopes to express her inner struggle and desire to share the mood with others, not to hear from others consolation, the producer used a very complicated rhythm set with G.E.M. whispering and multi-segmentation, and some echo effects, successfully creating the effect of empty echoes in the forest.
[5]
The third song "Selfless" symbolizes the animal as a
chameleon
. The song describes the state of being too fond of the other party and fascinates itself with the pulling state. When it is completely for the other party that it wants to sacrifice itself, in the end, it will only endure all the pain alone.
[6]
The fourth track, "Long After" is symbolize the animals as
cats
. On December 18, the listening session shared the sound source of the song. The song describes that if it is injured, it can only hide in the corner and lick the wound, but it must be strong in front of people.
[7]
[8]
The fifth track, "Walk on Water" is a very self-confident song. The representative animal of this song is the
Jesus Lizard
. When they are in danger, they can walk on the water to escape. This is exactly the meaning of the song: In times of difficulties and wind and waves, refuse to lose, don't retreat, and breakthrough with confidence.
[9]
The sixth track, "Mama" is a song that G.E.M. written to her mother. The representative animal of this song is
fireflies
. This song describes about mother's love.
[4]
The seventh track, "Grey Wolf" does not want to show the slyness of the
wolf
, but G.E.M. hopes to let everyone reflect on the facts we see through the wolf. The overall arrangement is very modern, and a lot of effort has been put into vocal processing. The echo of the sound, more reveals the lingering blur and the sly hidden features of the wolf that the music wants to show.
[5]
The eighth track, "Miss Similar" symbolizes the animal as a
peacock
, and describes this generation of imitation, giving birth to all kinds of strange ecology and humans. It is the only
rap song
in the album.
The ninth track, "Missing You" is a pure
guitar
's ballad song. It rumors is a love song that written for G.E.M.'s current couple, Mark Ngai. The song is not symbolized or representative any animal.
The tenth track, "Don't Force It" is a
duet
song featuring
Eric Chou
, representing the animal as a
hedgehog
. The "hedgehog's hug" is used to compare the state of a relationship. The two voices overlap to perfectly explain the heartbreak in love.
[10]
The eleventh track, "Unreachable" is using a very strong synthesizer sounds, symbolizing as a
butterfly
. The song describes precious things that are often not caught, and thank you for helping you along the way.
[4]
The twelfth track, "Full Stop". The representative animal of this song is the
hummingbird
. With G.E.M. song reviewing the 12 years of her artistic career, she once learned a blank piece of paper. Some things that cannot be conceded, tolerant of others are cruel to herself. She also hopes to use songs to encourage all those who stand at the crossroads of life and are confused about the future. Those who are in the middle of the authorities are confused and look up at the vast sky. No matter how hard the front is, it is right to face the challenge. It is not so difficult to draw a "full stop".
[11]
The last track of the album, "Still That Girl", which was also added later. G.E.M. wrote down the limitations and pains of life and showed her determination not to be defeated by reality.

The album
City Zoo
was generally well received after its release. Positive evaluations indicate that each song in the album has distinctive features, and in addition, the arrangement has also been well received.
[22]
Some commented that this was a new peak of Chinese music,
[23]
pointing out that G.E.M.'s used very spoken but profound music to show her struggling during this period of time and her 12 years of debut. The entire album arranges climaxes, and the rhythm is properly controlled. Adding experimental human voice effects in many places makes people appreciate the arrangement and lyrics of the arranger, and the symbol of animals, making the album more complete and interesting. Many music critics have pointed out that although there have been significant improvements in lyric writing, individual songs are still weak, and the album's idea integrity is slightly inferior.

, to Eva (Hubiak) and John Kravitz, Danny Kravitz was a reserve catcher for the Pirates from 1956 through 1959, and he also began the 1960 season with the Bucs, but was traded to the Athletics on June 1, 1960, for

home runs

His first major league home run occurred on May 11, 1956, in the bottom of the ninth inning with the bases loaded and the Pirates trailing the
Philadelphia Phillies
5-2. Kravitz' walk-off grand slam gave the Pirates a 6-5 win.
[2]
His MLB totals included 130
hits
, with 22
doubles
, seven
triples
, ten home runs and 54
runs batted in

"To Reign in Hell" by

[3]
Reception
[
edit
]
Reviewer Chuq von Rospach declared "The concept is silly," going on to say that "the plots are for the most part banal, and the characters are unsympathetic.  The writing is simplistic and the continuity is questionable.  In other words, they borrowed all of the worst parts of
Thieves' World
and forgot to include what makes it worthwhile."
[6]
The Encyclopedia of Hell
states "Author
Janet Morris
created a unique underworld saga in her 1984 book,
Heroes in Hell
, a witty novel that declares 'Nobody who is anybody went to heaven.'...[it] weaves myth, legend, fact, and fantasy into a fascinating tapestry of underworld lore."

Geography
[
edit
]
The Komunarskyi District is named after the former
Komunar
factory (currently, the
Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant
) which is located within the district's boundaries. The district is located in the southeastern portion of the city, on the left-bank of the

The
National Wildlife Health Center
(NWHC) is a science center of the
United States Geological Survey
. NWHC is located in
Madison, Wisconsin
, on a 24-acre plot of land that includes a main building and tight isolation building (TIB). The facility houses
Bio-safety Level 3
(BSL-3) and
Bio-safety Level 2
(BSL-2) laboratories on site.
The center studies several diseases that affect American
wildlife
including
bat
white nose syndrome
,
chronic wasting disease
(CWD),
avian influenza
, and
sylvatic plague
, among others.
[1]
In addition to the study of disease, NWHC has the capability to diagnose the causes of mass wildlife die-offs.  This is done via
necropsy
and the work of several
pathologists
,
biologists
, and other scientists.  The scientists are able to run
toxicology
,
heavy metal
and
tissue
analyses to determine cause of death.  A notable instance of this capability in use was during the mass die-off of birds, primarily
red-winged blackbirds
, in
Beebe, Arkansas
, on December 31, 2010. The NWHC determined the die-off to be the result of blunt trauma, most likely caused when the birds were frightened out of their nests at night by fireworks.
[2]
Honolulu Field Station
[
edit
]
In addition to the main facility in Madison, Wisconsin, the NWHC maintains a field station in
Honolulu, Hawaii
.  The Honolulu field station is responsible for researching diseases that effect Pacific Ocean wildlife, including birds,
sea turtles
, and
coral reefs
.
[3]
Generally staff for the NWHC Honolulu field station numbers around four staff, either federal employees or contractors.

Eşref Bitlis
(
Malatya
1933 -
Ankara
17 February 1993) was a general in the
Turkish Gendarmerie
, who died in a controversial plane crash.
Background
[
edit
]
He was born 1933 in the
eastern Anatolian
city of
Malatya
,
Turkey
. He attended the
Turkish Military Academy
, finishing it in 1952 with the rank of
lieutenant
. In 1966, he graduated from the
War Academy of the Army
(
Turkish
:
Kara Harp Akademisi
).
[1]
After completing a language course in
Germany
, Bitlis studied further at the Academy of the Turkish Armed Forces (
Turkish
:
Silahlı Kuvvetler Akademisi
), graduating in 1969. Later, he was educated at the
Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr
, the highest military academy of the
German armed forces
. He graduated in Germany in 1973.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
Following his graduation in Germany in 1973, Bitlis returned home and served one year as
head teacher
at the War Academy of the Army.
[1]
In 1978, Eşref Bitlis was promoted to
brigadier general
and appointed commander of the
2nd Commando Brigade in Bolu
, a
mountain warfare
specialized unit. After becoming a
major general
in 1978, he assumed the command of the 28th Infantry Division, headquartered in the Paşaköy village of
Nicosia
,
Cyprus
. In 1986, he advanced to the rank of a
lieutenant general
. Bitlis was appointed commander of the
Cyprus Turkish Peace Forces
. Two years later in 1990, he became an
army general
and General Commander of the
Turkish Gendarmerie
.
[1]
General Commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie (1990-1993)
[
edit
]
As General Commander of the
Turkish Gendarmerie
, Bitlis supported the plans of President
Turgut Özal
to resolve the
Kurdish-Turkish conflict
by peaceful means. A week before he died, Bitlis met the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran and Iraq to discuss Özal's peace plans. He was also investigating an issue which journalist
Uğur Mumcu
, assassinated in January 1993, had been, namely the funnelling of 100,000 rifles from Turkey to Kurdish armed forces in Iraq.
[2]
The
Turkish Daily News
later interviewed an army general who said that the commander of the
Joint United States Military Mission for Aid to Turkey
(JUSMMAT) had complained about Bitlis to the chief of staff for collecting information about illegal activities pertaining to
Operation Provide Comfort
(OPC).
[3]
Other OPC officers also complained to
Washington
. Bitlis aggressively opposed American designs; he had allegedly dismissed Americans supporting the Turkish Gendarmerie as well as
CIA
agents operating from humanitarian organizations active in the region. The interviewed general said that Bitlis had discovered arms intended for
Jalal Talabani
and
Massoud Barzani
concealed in crates purportedly containing food. According to another source, Bitlis was given photographs taken by
JITEM
operatives depicting three OPC helicopters distributing material to the
PKK
on 10 December 1992.
[4]
Such acts led Bitlis to conclude that America was intent on establishing a Kurdish state encompassing Turkey. Bitlis proposed to solve the PKK conflict by severing its logistical support. To this end, he suggested establishing relations with neighboring countries.
[5]
Death
[
edit
]
On February 17, 1993, a snowy day, Bitlis was on an official trip by plane from the
Güvercinlik Army Air Base
in
Ankara
. He switched airplanes when the pilot realized the cockpit was out of order.
[3]
His
Beechcraft Super King Air
B-200 crashed minutes after taking off from the air base. Bitlis, his
aide-de-camp
Fahir Işık, technician Emir Öner and the pilots, who had VIP green card certification for excellence in flying, died in the crash. The
chief of staff
, Gen.
Doğan Güreş
, said the accident was due to
atmospheric icing
[6]
but this has been denied by the manufacturer and experts from
Istanbul Technical University
and
Middle East Technical University
.
[7]
According to the
Etimesgut Air Base
Weather Department's weather report for that day, there was no ice accumulation: "Calm, windy, 1,500 meters visibility, snowy, low clouds affected. Cloud level 800 feet, peak 8,000 feet. The weather is completely overcast. The temperature is -4 degrees and the pressure is 1,018 milibars."
[3]
The military prosecutor who initially investigated the incident, Col. Hasan Tüysüzoğlu, remained convinced twenty years later that the crash was due to sabotage,
[8]
and said that the dossier was taken from him, and no further investigation deemed necessary.
[9]
Gendarmerie commander
Cem Ersever
, who had been in charge of the
JİTEM
group's southeastern operations, left the army in mid-1993. He was allegedly in contact with the PKK through the Syrian intelligence service and the American special forces.
[3]
Bitlis was fighting the PKK, and therefore on bad terms with Ersever. For this reason, some speculate that Ersever may have been responsible for Bitlis' death.
[3]
Ersever himself was killed on 4 November 1993, along with his girlfriend
Nevval Boz
and right-hand man
Mustafa Deniz
, some suggest to cover up Bitlis' death.
[3]
JITEM fugitive
Abdülkadir Aygan
suspects
Veli Küçük
, who is currently detained in the Ergenekon investigation, of having ordered Ersever's death. Ersever was resentful towards Küçük of being shunted to Ankara after the scandal surrounding Bitlis' death, perceiving Küçük as taking the credit for his achievements.
[10]
According to
Arif Doğan
, the plane crash was engineered by Ersever together with
Mahmut Yıldırım
(
Yeşil
).
[8]
Journalist Metin Kaplan offers a polar opposite account. Kaplan says that Ersever and Bitlis were in fact close friends, who were killed by American agents, and that Mustafa Deniz is still alive.
[4]
Kaplan thinks it unlikely that Ersever killed Bitlis considering their alleged closeness, and the fact that Ersever was poor; he allegedly received pocket money from his publisher. Kaplan says that a person tasked with carrying out an assassination for a foreign government would be well funded. Kaplan also says that the air base Bitlis departed from quartered two JUSMMAT planes, and two American technicians, who likely had access to Bitlis' plane. Ultimately, Kaplan concludes that the Turkish military was aware that the Americans did it, but covered it up to maintain good relations.
[4]
Recently uncovered evidence suggests that his death and that of  Mumcu may be related to the shadowy
Ergenekon network

Both Bitlis and Mumcu were investigating how Jalal Talabani, one of the Kurdish leaders of northern Iraq, came into possession of 100,000 firearms belonging to the
Turkish Armed Forces
.
[12]
However, the Ergenekon case is still in progress, and alternative explanations have been proffered to explain Mumcu's death (such as that Ersever did do it).
[13]
He was survived by his spouse Şükran and son Tarık.
My father was always a symbol of peace, so he was murdered. I believe that taking revenge is a sign of primitiveness and I will go on with my investigation into the accident.
- His son, Tarik.

Reopening of the death case
[
edit
]
On September 30, 2010, the office of the chief public prosecutor in Ankara reopened the case relating to the death of Bitlis on the basis of some news recently published in the Turkish media.
[1]
[15]
Prosecutor Hüseyin Görüşen was tasked with the investigation to find out the cause of the 1993 plane crash. The military prosecutor at the Turkish General Staff, who was responsible for the crash investigation, had closed the file with the finding that Bitlis' airplane crash was an accident without any human involvement.
[15]
However, serious allegations were made by suspects in the ongoing
Ergenekon
trial that the crash was an assassination.
[16]
The case was due to be closed in February 2013 due to the 20-year
statute of limitations
,
[17]
but in line with rulings from the
European Court of Human Rights
against statutes of limitations for murder, prosecutors said they would keep the case open.
[18]
In September prosecutors issued a "permanent investigation" order.

Stolobny Island
is an island on
Lake Seliger
in the
Tver Oblast
of
Russia
, about 10 km (6.2 mi) north of the town of
Ostashkov
.
Nilov Monastery
[
edit
]
The island is the home of
Nilov Monastery
, which was founded by Saint Nilus in 1594, and previously welcomed up to 40,000
pilgrims
each year.  Most of the buildings of the monastery were built in the 18th and 19th Centuries in a neoclassical style. Today the monastery complex remains one of the most impressive ensembles of
Neoclassical
architecture in Eastern Europe. Some of its churches date back to the 17th century. A graceful embankment was completed by 1812, and a large cathedral was built in 1821-25. The construction of the causeway to the island was completed in 1812. The Nilov Monastery was one of the largest and wealthiest monasteries in the Russian Empire.

Origin of name
[
edit
]
Nil Stolobensky
icon
, 1771
Regarding the name of the island - "Stolobny" - there are two versions. At first, it got its name because of its shape, like a pole, and the second, is that there was an ancient pagan temple that included a sacrificial post. In 1515 the Rev. Nil (Neil in English) Krypetsky worked as a lumberjack. He lived alone, ate grass and acorns, all the time spent in prayer. According to legend, one day robbers went to Rev. Nil, and decided to kill him. However, he prayed silently, went out to them with an icon of the Blessed Virgin. The robbers, dreaming that the Rev. was defended by many armed men, fell at his feet, repented and begged forgiveness.
Gradually the fame of the hermit spread through the local villages. People began coming to him, asking prayers and teachings. In 1528, tired of all the attention, he moved to a new location - the island of Stolobny at Lake Seliger, near Ostashkov. The first year he lived in a dugout, then built a hut and a chapel for prayers. According to legend, the devil repeatedly sent different calamities against the hermit - fires, even robbers tried to throw his cell in the lake. However, Rev. Nil was adamant, overcoming all attacks by prayer and faith.
Rev. Nil lived on the island a total of 27 years before his death, and he bequeathed to build a monastery on this site, which was later made. Nil died in 1555 and was buried on Stolobny. In 1594, with the permission of the Patriarch Job, a monastic cloister opened on the island. Thus began the history of monastery Nilo - Stolobensky. The founder of the monastery was a monk Herman.
History
[
edit
]
In 1919, after the
October Revolution
, the monastery was confiscated. It was closed in 1927 by the Soviet government and subsequently used for various purposes. From 1927 to 1939 there was a
work camp
for underage criminals.
[
citation needed
]
In the period 1939 to 1941, during the first years of
World War II
, the monastery was a
prisoner of war camp
of the Russian secret service
NKVD
, which held approximately 7,000 Polish
prisoners of war
who had been taken captive by the
Soviet Union
following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. Almost all of the prisoners were subsequently executed in April 1940 in Kalinin (now
Tver
) and then buried in mass graves in
Mednoye
, an act which became known as the
Katyn Massacre
. Amongst those killed were Polish officers, lawyers, policemen, teachers, doctors, and other members of the
intelligentsia
.
[
citation needed
]
From 1941 to 1945 there was a hospital in the building complex, and again from 1945 to 1960, a camp for minors and orphans. From 1960 to 1971 the monastery was used as a
retirement home
, and from 1971 to 1990 a
hostel
for tourists.

All statistics correct as of 9 July 2020.
The
2019-20
Ukrainian Cup
was the 29th annual season of
Ukraine
's
football
knockout competition. The competition started on 20 August 2019 and concluded on 8 July 2020 with the
final
at the
OSC Metalist
in
Kharkiv
.
All competition rounds consisted of a single game with a home field advantage granted to a team from lower league.
[2]
Qualification for the competition is granted to all professional clubs and finalists of the
Ukrainian Amateur Cup
as long as those clubs are able to pass the season's attestation (licensing).
Shakhtar Donetsk
was the defending winner for the last two seasons, but was eliminated by
Dynamo Kyiv
in the round of 16. The Donetsk club has reached the competition finals in the last nine years winning seven of them.
[2]
Dynamo Kyiv
won their 12th Ukrainian Cup title after beating
Vorskla Poltava
8-7 on penalties in the final with the game ending in the 1-1 draw. They therefore qualified to the group stage of the
2020-21 UEFA Europa League
, however they can still qualify for the
Champions League
through league season.
Some changes were introduced. Unlike the last season starting with the third round of the competition there was a seeded draw, while for the first two rounds the draw remained blind.
[3]
This was the first Ukrainian Cup season to implement the
Video assistant referee
(VAR) system on some matches, the first game to use VAR was the quarter-final match between
Dynamo Kyiv
and
Oleksandriya
.
[4]
On 17 March 2020, the
Ukrainian Association of Football
made a decision to pause all football competitions in the country on 18 March 2020 for an unspecified period of time (until the decision to resume competitions) due to the
COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine
, which caused a postponement of the semi-final and final matches to another date.
[5]
[1]

Hans Moldenhauer
(10 April 1901 - 29 December 1929) was
Germany
's first major international
tennis
player, competing in Wimbledon, the Davis Cup, and the French Open, and repeatedly winning the German national Championships both as a single player and in mixed doubles.
[1]
He died at the age of just 28, when his motor car was hit by a tram in
Berlin
. He is buried at the
Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery
.

Daniel Prenn
(left) and Moldenhauer
Moldenhauer won back-to-back
German National Championships
in 1926 and 1927, and made his third successive final in 1928 where he lost to
Daniel Prenn
.
[3]
He also won the Danish Championship Men's Singles in 1929.
Moldenhauer played 22 times for Germany in the Davis Cup in 1927, 1928, and 1929.
In the
1929 French Championships
, entering the tournament as the 16th seed, Moldenhauer was the only German to make the fourth round. His defeat in the fourth round was to the top seed,
Henri Cochet
.
He competed in the
1929 Wimbledon Championships
and reached the second round, where he lost in five sets to fifth seed
Umberto De Morpurgo
, an Italian whom he had beaten just weeks earlier in an
International Lawn Tennis Challenge
rubber. That match also went to five sets.
[4]
The German team led by Moldenhauer would win that tie against the
Italy
and also defeated
Czechoslovakia
in
Prague
, where Moldenhauer won two rubbers, including the doubles, partnering Prenn.
[4]
This put Germany into the 1929 European Zone final against
Great Britain
, which they won 3-2, with Moldenhauer winning a singles rubber over
Bunny Austin
.
[4]
They were then
whitewashed
in the Inter-Zone final by the
United States
.
[4]
Moldenhauer lost all three of his rubbers, one of which was against
Bill Tilden
.
[4]
It was Moldenhauer's final International Lawn Tennis Challenge appearance, meaning he finished with 14 career wins, from 22 matches.
[4]
Mixed doubles with Cilly Aussem
[
edit
]
In 1925, Moldenhauer became German Champion in mixed doubles together with his partner Cilly Aussem, and the pair competed successfully together until December 1929 when Moldenhauer was killed in a car crash. After this incident, Aussem travelled to France together with her mother to recover.

Plot
[
edit
]
When Elizabeth arrives home from visiting Paige, Philip tells a furious Elizabeth that he has been reporting on her activities as requested by someone from "back home" (Oleg), who claimed that she has been working for a cabal that is trying to overthrow Gorbachev and the Soviet government. Elizabeth becomes especially angry when Philip tells her that she needs to think about what she is doing. The FBI believes that the Russian Orthodox priest Father Victor may be a spy and calls him in for a meeting. However, the witnesses' descriptions of the Chicago illegals do not match the drawings that the FBI has from its previous illegals incidents. Gorbachev arrives in the USA. Elizabeth tells Claudia that Nesterenko has a solo meeting set up with the US negotiators.
After Glenn's attempt to kill a suffering Erica by overdose failed, "Stephanie" kills her by suffocation. Glenn tells "Stephanie" that he left the negotiating team over Erica's illness and offers her one of Erica's pictures, which she takes and burns. Renee gets a job interview at the FBI; Stan says they would want to know if she is a loyal American and can keep secrets. To tape Nesterenko's meeting without Glenn there, Elizabeth (as "Wendy") seduces Jackson, the congressional intern, and has him unwittingly plant a box of documents containing a recording device in the room. Stan takes a picture of Elizabeth to Curtis,
one of Gregory's people
, who doesn't recognize her but remembers that the woman smoked constantly.
When "Wendy" has Jackson bring her the planted box, he challenges her story and reveals that he found the planted recording device. Elizabeth allows him to leave her car without harm, even though he claims not to understand her instructions. On the tape, Elizabeth hears Nesterenko discuss Gorbachev's vision of a nuclear-free world, without saying anything against the interests of the USSR. Philip goes to Stavos's apartment to apologize; Stavos says that he always suspected something irregular was going on with the travel agency, even though he never called the police.
Claudia orders Elizabeth to kill Nesterenko immediately with a cyanide gun, but she does not, although she has a chance. Instead, Elizabeth returns and demands an explanation from Claudia, who admits to being part of a Center plot to overthrow Gorbachev, which would then be advanced by falsifying Elizabeth's reports on Nesterenko. Elizabeth refuses to continue as a part of it. Philip rents and watches a Russian movie. Returning home, Elizabeth tells Philip to contact Oleg to confirm the anti-Gorbachev plot and also asks Philip to take a meeting with Father Andrei tomorrow while she watches over Nesterenko.

Location of fire within Utah.
The
Machine Gun Fire
or
Camp Williams Fire
was a
wildfire
in
Herriman
,
Utah
in 2010 that burned
several
dwellings
.  It was started by a mistake at a firing range by
National Guard troops
on a training exercise. 4,351 acres burned,
approximately
1600 homes were evacuated, and 3 homes were destroyed.
[1]
Origin
[
edit
]
Live fire
50 caliber machine gun
training had been scheduled at
Camp Williams
for the afternoon of Sunday, 19 September 2010.  As is common in the area during the late summer, the east winds off of the
Wasatch Mountains
picked up in the afternoon. On the previous Thursday afternoon, the
National Weather Service
issued a
Fire Weather Watch
for Saturday and Sunday. On Friday afternoon, it upgraded the alert to a
Red Flag Warning
for the entire weekend.
[2]
Despite the dry conditions and base protocols that interdicted live-fire training during Red Flag conditions, a unit of the
Utah National Guard
commenced the live-fire exercise, although no highly flammable tracer rounds were used.
[3]
Shrapnel ignited the brush.
[4]
The
Utah National Guard
admitted full responsibility.
[5]
Suppression
[
edit
]
After the fire was noted on the
Camp Williams
Machine Gun Firing Range, on Sunday afternoon,
fire crews
from the camp with the assistance of two
Black Hawk helicopters
attempted to put out the blaze, but were unsuccessful, and the fire, whipped by dry winds, burned northwestward across Oak Springs Hollow.
Camp Williams
firefighters notified the
Utah Unified Fire Authority
[6]
who mobilized local fire agencies.  However the fire crossed Shep's Ridge, and continued on to burn some houses on the edge of Herriman.  The fire had burned over 4,351 acres and was fully contained by 24 September 2010.
[5]
The
Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) authorized the use of federal funds in paying the costs of fighting the fire. FEMA approved the Fire Management Assistance Grant under a statute which provides reimbursement of up to 75 percent of the state's qualifying fire fighting costs.
[7]
Evacuations continued into Tuesday September 21, 2010, although the number of homes under evacuation orders lessened to 450 homes. The same day, it was announced that the fire was 50 percent contained. Several residents were allowed back to their homes.

NGC 1439
is an
elliptical galaxy
located in constellation of
Eridanus
. Situated about 77 million light years away, it is a member of the
Eridanus cluster
of galaxies, a cluster of about 200 galaxies. It was discovered by
William Herschel
on 9 December 1784.
NGC 1439 has a
Hubble classification
of E1, which indicates it is an elliptical galaxy with no extensions. It is moving away from the
Milky Way
at a rate of 1,668 km/s. Its size on the night sky is 2.4' x 2.2' which is proportional to its real size of 54 000 ly.
NGC 1439 is an early-type galaxy. Despite their name, early-type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies, and mostly comprise old, red-colored stars. Very little star formation occurs in these galaxies; the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward.
[3]
Most of the galaxies like NGC 1439 are dust poor. However, NGC 1439 contains more dust than usual.

Scioptic balls
.
The
scioptic ball
is a
universal joint
allowing an optical instrument mounted on a ball to be swiveled to point anywhere in a wide arc. It was inspired by studies of the human eye. It has a number of applications. The scioptic ball may provide a firm anchor for a
microscope
,
camera
or
telescope
allowing it to be swiveled in all directions, for example to follow the course of an
eclipse
or for drawing
panoramic views
. Scioptic balls have been used as
camera obscuras
, projecting images from the outside on walls in darkened rooms. Scioptic balls have been used simply as light sources. It was an early example of a type of
wide-angle lens
.
History
[
edit
]
Daniel Schwenter
(1585-1636), professor of mathematics and oriental languages, developed the scioptic ball in 1636. In 1685,
Johann Zahn
illustrated a large workshop
camera obscura
for
solar
observations using the telescope and scioptic ball.

Cathedral Preparatory School and Seminary
is a
Roman Catholic
high school and
seminary
in
Elmhurst, Queens
in New York City.  It is operated by the
Diocese of Brooklyn
.  It is the last full-time high school seminary day school in operation in the United States.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Cathedral College
[
edit
]
In early 1914,
Charles E. McDonnell
, bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn, decided that the diocese needed a
minor seminary
(high school seminary) to ensure a supply of priests. He appointed then Monsignor George Mundelein as the first rector of
Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception
.  In September 1914, 110 students started classes in Cathedral College's temporary quarters at
Saint John’s Chapel
in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.
[3]
In December 1914, the diocese broke ground for the new campus in the
Clinton Hill
neighborhood in Brooklyn.
Cathedral College started operation as a six-year minor seminary, with a four-year high school track and a two-year college track. Upon completion of the six-year program, students continuing on to priesthood would be assigned to a
major seminary
.  Many other students went on to become members of religious orders, lawyers, doctors and teachers.
[3]
Cathedral Preparatory Seminary
[
edit
]
In 1963, Cathedral College opened a second location in Elmhurst;  it was called Cathedral Preparatory Seminary.  There were now two minor seminaries in the Diocese of Brooklyn.  In 1967, Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception converted to a four-year college seminary and moved to
Douglaston, New York
. The Queens and Brooklyn campuses of Cathedral Preparatory Seminary were separated from the college.  Both campuses continued as four-year high school programs, operated by the Diocese of Brooklyn.
[4]
The diocese closed the Brooklyn campus in 1985, leaving the Queens campus as the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary.
[5]
In 2002, the rector of Cathedral Prep, Monsignor Charles M. Kavanagh, was accused of
sexual abuse
by a former seminarian at the school.  The accuser, Daniel Donahue of
Portland, Oregon
claimed Kavanagh had made unwanted advances and touched him inappropriately in the 1980s, starting as an eighth grader at the seminary and continuing at Cathedral College.
[6]
Donahue complained to the police and the diocese in 2002. Kavanagh denied all the charges. A
review board
from the
Archdiocese of New York
found him guilty in 2003.  Kavanagh appealed the decision, but a
tribunal
from another diocese affirmed the decision. After another appeal, a second tribunal said Kavanagh was guilty and should be
defrocked
.
[7]
Cathedral Preparatory School and Seminary
[
edit
]
Currently, students from both the Diocese of Brooklyn and the Diocese of Rockville Centre attend the school, as well as one student from the Archdiocese of New York. Since 1968, each summer Cathedral has hosted the Father Edward W. Troike Leadership Program for young men of 6th and 7th grades, as well as incoming freshmen.
[5]
Since 1914 nearly 4,500 students have received high school diplomas from Cathedral Prep. The school alumni include cardinals, bishops, priests, religious and laity.

King of Matabeleland (reigned 1868-1894)
Lobengula Khumalo
(c. 1845 - c. 1894) was the second and last official king of the
Northern Ndebele people
(historically called Matabele in English). Both names in the
Ndebele language
mean "the men of the long shields", a reference to the Ndebele warriors' use of the
Nguni shield
.
Background
[
edit
]
The Matabele were descendants of a faction of the
Zulu people
who fled north during the reign of
Shaka
following the
mfecane
("the crushing") or
difaqane
("the scattering"). Shaka's general,
Mzilikazi
led his followers away from Zulu territory after a falling-out. In the late 1830s, they settled in what is now called Matabeleland in western
Zimbabwe
, but they claimed sovereignty over a much wider area.
Members of the tribe had a privileged position against outsiders whose lives were subject to the will of the king. In return for their privileges, however, the Ndebele people both men and women had to submit to a strict discipline and status within the hierarchy. That set out their duties and responsibilities to the rest of society. Infringements of any social responsibility were punished with death, subject to the king's seldom-awarded reprieve. This tight discipline and loyalty were the secret of the Ndebele's success in dominating their neighbours.
[2]
Birthright
[
edit
]
After the death of Mzilikazi, the first king of the Ndebele nation, in 1868, the
izinduna
, or chiefs, offered the crown to Lobengula, one of Mzilikazi's sons from an inferior wife. Several
impis
(regiments) led by Chief Mbiko Masuku disputed Lobengula's ascent, and the question was ultimately decided by the arbitration of the
assegai
, with Lobengula and his impis crushing the rebels. Lobengula's courage in the battle led to his unanimous selection as king.
[
who?
]
Coronation
[
edit
]
The coronation of Lobengula took place at Mhlahlandlela, one of the principal military towns. The Ndebele nation assembled in the form of a large semicircle, performed a war dance, and declared their willingness to fight and die for Lobengula. A great number of cattle were slaughtered, and the choicest meats were offered to Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual leader, and to the dead Mzilikazi. Great quantities of
millet
beer were also consumed.
About 10,000 Matabele warriors in full war costume attended the crowning of Lobengula. Their costumes consisted of a headdress and short cape made of black ostrich feathers, a kilt made of leopard or other skins and ornamented with the tails of white cattle. Around their arms they wore similar tails and around their ankles they wore rings of brass and other metals. Their weapons consisted of one or more long spears for throwing and a short stabbing-spear or assegai (also the principal weapon of the
Zulu people
). For defence, they carried large oval shields of ox-hide, either black, white, red, or speckled according to the impi (regiment) they belonged to.
The Ndebele maintained their position due to the greater size and tight discipline in the army, to which every able-bodied man in the tribe owed service. "The Ndebele army, consisting of 15,000 men in 40 regiments [was] based around Lobengula's capital of
Bulawayo
."
[3]
The chameleon and the fly:
"Did you ever see a
chameleon
catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then the other. At last, when well within reach, he darts his tongue and the fly disappears.
England
is the chameleon and I am that fly."
—
Lobengula
[4]
Rule
[
edit
]
In 1870 Lobengula granted Sir
John Swinburne
's London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the
Tati River
between the
Shashe
and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the
Tati Concession
.
[5]
[6]
However, it was not until about 1890 that any significant mining in the area commenced.
[

Lobengula had been tolerant of the white hunters who came to
Matabeleland
; he would even go so far as to punish those of his tribe who threatened the whites. However, when a British team (Francis Thompson,
Charles Rudd
and
Rochfort Maguire
) came in 1888 to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory, he was wary about entering into negotiations. Lobengula gave his agreement only when his friend,
Leander Starr Jameson
, a qualified medical doctor who had once treated Lobengula for gout, proposed to secure money and weaponry for the Matabele in addition to a pledge that any people who came to dig would be considered as living in his kingdom. As part of this agreement, and at the insistence of the British, neither the
Boers
nor the Portuguese would be permitted to settle or gain concessions in Matabeleland. Although, Lobengula was illiterate and was not aware of how damaging this contract was to his country, only found out the real terms of the contract he signed as his subjects found out. After going to friendly English missionaries to confirm this rumor, Lobengula sent two emissaries to the British queen,
Victoria
, but this proved futile. They were delayed by
Alfred Beit
's associates at the port. As a last resort, Lobengula formally protested the contract to the queen on 23 April 1889. As a response from the queen's advisor, Lobengula was told it was "impossible for them to exclude white men". Lobengula informed Queen Victoria he and his Indunas would recognize the contract as they believe he was tricked. The 25-year
Rudd Concession
was signed by Lobengula on 30 October 1888.

Matabele War
[
edit
]
The
First Matabele War
began in October 1893, and the
British South Africa Company
's overwhelming military force led to devastating losses for the Ndebele warriors, notably at the
Battle of the Shangani
. As early as December 1893, it was reported that Lobengula had been very sick, but his death sometime in early 1894 was kept a secret for many months, and the cause of his death remains uncertain.

, Governor of the defunct
Bendel State
. Subsequently, he was appointed Chairman of the
Nigerian Railway Corporation
. In 1999, he was also a political adviser to Governor

[11]
[12]
[13]
In 2015, he was elected into office as a Senator representing Delta North senatorial district in the
National Assembly
.
[14]
[15]
He was subsequently appointed Chairman Senate committee on Niger Delta.
[16]
In 2019, he was re-elected into the senate under the
People's Democratic Party
.
[17]
[18]
On June 23, 2021, the Delta State PDP suspended Nwaoboshi for "anti-party activities after a public spat between Nwaoboshi and
Governor
Ifeanyi Okowa
.
[19]
Nwaoboshi called the suspension "laughable" and "illegal" before leaving the PDP two days later and joining the APC at a meeting with President Buhari and
Delta Central
Senator
Ovie Omo-Agege
.
[20]
[21]
The Punch
reported that Nwaoboshi's switch was in preparation for a run for Deputy Governor of Delta State.
[22]
Election dispute
[
edit
]
On 3 April 2019 a Federal High Court in Abuja sacked Nwaoboshi as Senator-elect for Delta North senatorial district on grounds that he was not validly nominated in the party primaries held by the
People's Democratic Party
in
Delta State
.
[23]
He was also ordered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed to stop parading himself as senator-elect. According to the summons filed against him by his opponent in the party primaries Prince Nwoko stated that the
People's Democratic party
had unlawfully announced him the winner after he was defeated in the primaries, it was also alleged that Nwoboshi hired thugs to cause a mass scare and stampede when he learnt of his brewing defeat.
[24]
[25]
On 4 April 2019, Nwaoboshi appealed to the judgement sacking him as senator-elect.
[26]
[27]
On 17 April 2019, a Federal High Court in Abuja denied Nwaoboshi's appeal to issue a restraining order to
Independent National Electoral Commission
stating that it was out of its jurisdiction as an Appeal court had already ruled on the case, consequently the Justice
Mahmud Mohammed
ordered that Independent National Electorate Commission should withdraw the certificate of return issued to Nwaoboshi and reissue a new certificate to Prince Ned Nwoko.Although he is now the Delta North Senator
[28]
[29]
On 11 May 2019, the Independent National Electoral Commission withdrew the certificate of return issued to Nwaoboshi.
[30]
[31]
[32]
The certificate was returned when the court decision was overturned.
Bills sponsored
[
edit
]
In 2016, Peter Nwaoboshi sponsored a bill "
The Code of Conduct Act Cap C15 LFN 2004 (Amendment) Bill, 2016 (SB 248)
". The bill passed its first reading but was never signed or implemented into law.
[33]
[34]
Corruption allegations
[
edit
]
₦322 million fraud and money laundering trial
[
edit
]
In April 2018, the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
arraigned Nwaoboshi on charges of fraud and money laundering. The prosecution claimed Nwaoboshi's companies bought a
Lagos
building for ₦805 million in 2014 with the knowledge that ₦322 million of the payment would be used illegally; Nwaoboshi denied the claims and entered a not guilty plea.
[35]
In June 2021, Nwaoboshi was cleared of the fraud and money laundering charges after presiding Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke said the EFCC failed to prove the charges and relied on hearsay. The EFCC said that they would appeal the decision.
[36]
[22]
False Asset Declaration
[
edit
]
In April 2016, a
Sahara Reporters
article accused Nwaoboshi of acquiring under suspicious circumstances and then failing to disclose a Lagos property he owns. The home was owned by the Delta State Government before being sold to Nwaoboshi for a suspiciously low price and Nwaoboshi had not declared his ownership as legally required. The report came in the wake of Nwaoboshi sponsoring an amendment intended to weaken anti-corruption laws, and the article claimed that his support may have been in an attempt to stop the Code of Conduct Bureau from trying him.
[37]
In June 2019, charges were filed against Nwaoboshi for failing to declare his true assets after an investigation by the Special Presidential Investigation Panel on the Recovery of Public Property (SPIP) which accused Nwaoboshi of failing to disclose his ownership of three
Sterling Bank
accounts.
[38]
In July 2018, SPIP temporarily sealed several more of Nwaoboshi's assets including up to 14 properties and 22 bank accounts.
[39]
NDDC contract scandal
[
edit
]
In June 2020, the
Niger Delta Development Commission
accused Nwaoboshi of using 11 front companies to defraud the Commission out of ₦3.6 billion worth of contracts in September 2016. The accusation came not long after Nwaoboshi accused
Niger Delta Minister
Godswill Akpabio
of improperly securing project funds when Akpabio was Senate Minority Leader.
[40]
While the accusations were a part of a wider spat between Akpabio and the
National Assembly
, the accusation against Nwaoboshi was termed "biggest single case of looting of the commission’s resources" by NDDC spokesperson Charles Odili.
[41]
Conviction
[
edit
]
The Court of Appeal on July 1, 2022, found Nwaoboshi guilty of money laundering and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment alongside two of his companies Golden Touch Construction Project Ltd and Suiming Electrical Ltd. The conviction followed an appeal of the previous judgment by a Federal High Court dismissing the submission of the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
.
The Appeal Court ruled that there was merit in the application of the EFCC and that Nwaoboshi failed to convince the court that he didn't commit the crime.

Sulaikha Manzil
is the final film to feature veteran actor
Mamukkoya
, who died on 26 April 2023.
[5]
Plot
[
edit
]
The movie begins with a music video shot in a
spoof
-like manner, which can be related to the visual grammar of popular Malayalam music albums of the 2000s (a music single by singer Saleem Kodathur is used as the backing track, which can be traced back to the era). It can be seen that the lead actors of the movie (except
Lukman Avaran
) are acting in the song, where Haala is in love with a guy named Ashiq against her family's will, and eventually Ashiq dies in a road accident.
Sameer, an NRI who works in the
UAE
, has been in search of a groom for his sister Haala for many years. Haala and Sameer are not on good terms for undisclosed reasons, and she rejects every proposal brought by Sameer. She finally agrees to marry Ameen, who also works in the UAE. Sameer and Ameen meet each other in the UAE and arrange the marriage on very short notice. Ameen is visibly confused about the short notice but agrees anyway.
Ameen wants to get acquainted with Haala before marriage, but she does not seem to care. Ameen calls her the day before marriage and discovers she hasn't even saved his contact information on her phone and he discusses the matter with his friend Anwar. Meanwhile, Haala discusses with her cousin Amina that she just lacks the "excitement" but is okay with the marriage. Ameen called Haala again, but she couldn't answer the phone. When she returned the call, Ameen said he wanted to meet her, and Haala agrees. But she couldn't make it as she was trapped with her relatives. Angered, Ameen calls Haala and scolds her while she is on speakerphone, and Amina and Bathool get involved. Amina asks Haala whether she wants to call off the wedding. Bathool, Haala's sister-in-law, however, suggests waiting sometime, and if Ameen calls back and says sorry, Haala should hear him. Haala agreed to this, and Ameen called back and expressed his regret. Now that both are happy, Ameen asked her again, and she said to come to her house secretly in the evening.
Ameen couldn't escape from his house but managed to get in a car with his friends and drive to Haala's house. He met Haala in her backyard and discussed his concerns. Haala said she can't get close with someone on such short notice, but she is trying. Ameen agrees initially but eventually starts a fight. Ameen decided to call off the wedding, and Haala is seen confused. Ameen and friends got in the car, but got stuck as it partially fell into a drainage canal. Guests and relatives from Haala's house came to the rescue and learned it was Ameen. They invited him to the house, and Ameen couldn't resist.
At Haala's house, celebrations have begun as Ameen came to the house unexpectedly and surprisingly. They asked Ameen to perform on stage, but a depressed Ameen stood still. Ameen decides to announce his decision but suddenly learns that everyone is so happy and he doesn't want to spoil the mood. He abandons his decision to call off the wedding at the moment and meets Haala. Haala asks why he changed his mind, and Ameen replies that he doesn't want to ruin people's happiness and will disclose the matter to Haala's family once he gets home. Haala clears Ameen's mind and says Ameen's decision to not ruin others' happiness is the best quality that she imagined in her life partner, and they both return happily.
The next day, at Haala's house, the
Nikkah
ceremony is about to begin. The priest asks Sameer whether he had his sister's permission for the wedding. Sameer remained silent, and the priest insisted that he do it formally in front of everyone. Sameer, overwhelmed with feelings, walks towards Haala and hugs her, and breaks the ice between them.

Website
Seefeel
are a British
electronic
and
post-rock
band formed in the early 1990s by
Mark Clifford
(guitar, programming), Daren Seymour (bass), Justin Fletcher (drums, programming), and Sarah Peacock (vocals, guitar). Their work became known for fusing guitar-based
shoegaze
with the production techniques of
ambient techno
and
electronica
.
[3]
[5]
Initially forming as a more conventional
rock
band, Seefeel soon embraced
electronic
production and gained recognition for their 1993 debut EP
More Like Space
and first album
Quique
(1993), both on the British independent label
Too Pure
.
[6]
The band subsequently released music on electronic labels
Warp Records
and
Rephlex
, and then went on an extended hiatus in 1997, with members pursuing the side-projects
Scala
and Disjecta.
Following the reissue of
Quique
in 2007, Clifford and Peacock relaunched Seefeel and were joined by Shigeru Ishihara (
DJ Scotch Egg
) on bass, and former
Boredoms
drummer Iida Kazuhisa (E-Da). In 2010 they released the
Faults
EP (their first new recording in 14 years)
[8]
followed shortly after by an
eponymous LP
in 2011, both on Warp.
History
[
edit
]
Early years
[
edit
]
Clifford originally began writing tracks for what became Seefeel in late 1991. He placed an advert at
Goldsmiths College
, London where he was a student, and it was answered by Fletcher who joined him on drums.
[9]
Peacock became part of the group after Clifford answered an advert she had placed in the
NME
.
[9]
Soon Darren Seymour joined them on bass. Early recordings were made at home, and other London studios. A demo tape was sent to three record companies and to
John Peel
at
BBC Radio 1
. John Peel rang Peacock to say how much he liked the tracks and the band would later perform a session for his Radio 1 show. Soon after, one of the labels that had been sent a demo, Too Pure, approached the band.
[9]
First releases on Too Pure
[
edit
]
The band's first release was the self-produced
More Like Space
EP, released in Autumn 1993.
[9]
It was largely compiled from four-track home recordings,
[10]
but enhanced in the studio. Subsequently, the
Plainsong
EP was released along with an EP of remixes including two remixes of 'Time to Find Me' by
Aphex Twin
.
[9]
Notorious for tearing tracks apart when remixing them, Aphex Twin notably left the track much as it was released, asserting in an interview for
Lime Lizard
magazine, prior to remixing the track  "I think it's gonna be a weird kind of a mix because I really, really like their stuff as it is, and what I'm going to do is just add a groove to it. But I'm definitely gonna make it slow. The main reason I like it is that as soon as you turn it off it leaves this big gap, this really big void. Fucking hell, that's well intense, I love it!"
[11]
These first two EPs, along with the remix EP, were later released in the US as a single CD
Polyfusia
, by Astralwerks.
The band's first album,
Quique
, was released in October 1993.
[9]
Initial recordings for the album were made at home before the band transferred to Falconer Studios in North London, where the recordings were finished and the album mixed. It was mixed and produced by Mark Clifford. On its release,
Quique
was critically acclaimed, and was one of
Melody Maker
'
s 'Albums of the Year'.
[12]
In his review for the
Melody Maker
,
Simon Reynolds
called the album "consummate, a blanched canvas for the imagination".
[13]
Spin
magazine's review stated "Seefeel, have struck a sublime groove midway between
MBV
's sensual tumult and Aphex Twin's ambient serenity" going on to add "you try to squint your ear in order to bring the music into focus, then give up, and just bask in the gorgeous, amorphous glow".
[14]
Quique
was re-released in 2007 in redux form, containing alternate versions and material not released at the time. Reviewing this re-issue Pitchfork stated that "Seefeel's music continues to sparkle 14 years later, an entire generation having built an ambient-motorik noise-pop aesthetic around
Quique
songs like 'Plainsong'" and adding "
Quique
still sounds timeless".
[15]
The band also became a notable live act, receiving many positive reviews in the
NME
and
Melody Maker
. In his review in
Melody Maker
of their show at the Garage, London, just prior to the release of
Quique
, Simon Reynolds noted their performance was "like an orgasm turned into an environment, a honeycomb space of luminous, globular goo. You feel like you're actually inside the drugged or orgasmic body, a grotto of rushes, tingles, shivers, pangs, spasms" further adding that the band was "a pipe-dream come true, and the best new band of '93".
[13]
The band toured in Europe with the
Cocteau Twins
soon after the release of
Quique
,
[9]
and Mark Clifford later undertook remix work for the band.
Signing to Warp Records
[
edit
]
Following the success of
Quique
, Seefeel were approached by Warp Records in early 1994.
[9]
They subsequently signed to the label and became the first band signed to Warp who used guitars. Steve Beckett, the label's owner said in an interview "Seefeel were the first band that Warp signed who had guitars...they were brave to sign to us because they became the 'older siblings' in the family and took all the flak by breaking the unwritten rules of an (up until then) purely dance label".
[16]
The band's first release on the label was the 1994
Starethrough
EP.
[9]
The four tracks emphasised the electronic side of the band more than previous recordings. The EP included the track "Spangle", which was featured on Warp's
Artificial Intelligence II
compilation and, in 2009, on the Warp20 compilation
Chosen
, being voted in the all-time Top 20 Warp tracks by the label's fans and being one of the choices of Warp founder Steve Beckett. The single "Fracture" was released soon after, along with a video made by Peacock, the band's first. The video appeared on the DVD
WarpVision
. Seefeel's first album for Warp,
Succour
, was released in 1995.
[9]
Succour
incorporated a darker, more abstracted sound than their first album, and while commercially a more difficult record, was nevertheless again well received. Writing in the
NME
, Sharon O'Connell stated "
Succour
provides both everything and nothing and is just as much a minefield as a treasure trove. It's beautiful. Be careful".
[17]
The band played several dates of their own as well as touring alongside
Spiritualized
. They also recorded a four track session at
Maida Vale Studios
in London for the John Peel Show on BBC Radio 1.
[18]
Touring, however, took its strain on the band and they embarked on a self-imposed hiatus which, although designed initially as a break, turned into a long absence.
[19]
In 1996, Seefeel released
(CH-VOX)
on Rephlex. After remixing "Time to Find Me", Richard James and Mark Clifford had become friends. James had asked Clifford and Seefeel to do a record for his Rephlex label and they had agreed. When signing to Warp Records, their contract recognised the promise made to James and following the release of
Succour
, Rephlex were given tracks recorded during these sessions and after but unreleased. Although intended as an EP, the record is considered by many to be the band's 'third' album.
(CH-Vox)
reduced percussion to a bare minimum and brought aural tapestries of processed guitar and fragmented sounds to the forefront.
Relaunch - 2009 to the present
[
edit
]
Following the re-issue of their first album
Quique
in 2007, Clifford and Peacock discussed writing new material. Clifford recalls, "Sarah and I got together to do some interviews and we just talked and decided to exchange a few ideas to see if Seefeel was worth pursuing again".
[19]
In an interview for
Bleep.com
, Clifford further explained "I was forced to listen to (
Quique
) again and also to dig out unreleased recordings and for the first time in a long time I realised that actually we were good. We had something special".
[20]
Daren Seymour and Justin Fletcher were not able to be a part of the rejuvenated band due to prior commitments and living outside the UK, so Clifford recruited Kazuhisa Iida (ex-
Boredoms
) and Shigeru Ishihara (
DJ Scotch Egg
) on drums and bass respectively. They were asked by Warp to play at the label's 20th anniversary show in Paris in 2009 and  Steve Beckett was so taken with their performance, he encouraged them to re-sign to Warp and to record new material. They began writing new tracks and eventually decamped to Church Road Studios in Brighton, though material was eventually mixed at home. The first fruits of their sessions was the 2010
Faults
EP,
[8]
followed in 2011 by the self-titled album
Seefeel
. The recordings showed a grittier side to the band.
The Guardian
newspaper observed "instruments glitched and phased into near-oblivion, their riffs reborn as weird digital signatures", going on to call the album "A hugely impressive rebirth".
[21]
Boomkat noted "Seefeel have moved with the times, adjusting their trademark sound with characteristically fractal noise textures from Shigeru and more organic, pounding drums from Boredoms' E-da. There's still a sunkissed bliss running throughout the album, but it's of a more sullied, toxic variety".
[22]
Related projects
[
edit
]
Mark Clifford has released music under the name Disjecta.
[23]
[24]
Disjecta was named after a collection of essays by
Samuel Beckett
and was described as an outlet for his abstract constructivist
electronica
.
[24]
Disjecta's music albums include
Looking For Snags
(1995),
Clean Pit and Lid
(1996) and
True_Love By Normal
(2003).
[24]
Clifford also released music under the name Woodenspoon.
[25]
Clifford also formed other collaborative music projects. On meeting vocalist Sophie Hinkley at London's Milk Bar, the two formed the group Sneakster who released the album
Pseudo-Nouveau
in 1999.
[25]
[26]
Clifford also collaborated with
Mira Calix
recording material between 1999 and 2004.
[27]
Their recordings were released as
Lost Foundling
in 2010.
[27]
He is currently collaborates with Scott Gordon (Loops Haunt) under the name Oto Hiax and their first self-titled album was released by Editions Mego in 2016.
Drummer Iida Kazuhisa (E-Da) went on to form audio-visual project
Adrena Adrena
with visual artist Daisy Dickinson in late 2016.
[28]
The remaining members of Seefeel, Sarah Peacock, Justin Fletcher, and Daren Seymour collaborated with former Seefeel member Mark van Hoen in their group
Scala
.
[29]
Scala's sound was described by
AllMusic
as "More indebted to noise and
trip-hop
than the looped sound-wash Seefeel had been known for, the quartet also focused on a somewhat tighter song structure and emphasized Peacock's vocals."
[29]
Scala released their debut album
Beauty Nowhere
in 1997 followed by two albums in 1998:
To You in Alpha
and
Compass Heart
.
[29]
After working with Scala, Peacock continued work in the group January.

Nicholas I of Saint Omer
was a
French
knight
[
citation needed
]
who in the aftermath of the
Fourth Crusade
became a lord in the
Frankish
Duchy of Athens
.
Nicholas was a younger son of
William IV of Saint Omer
,
castellan
of
Saint-Omer
then in Flanders, and Ida of
Avesnes
.
[1]
[2]
Ida's brother
James of Avesnes
took part in the
Fourth Crusade
(1203-04) and accompanied
Boniface of Montferrat
in the conquest and partition of Greece in its aftermath. He was rewarded with possessions in
Euboea
, but was dead by August 1205.
[1]
Nicholas remained in his native region until ca. 1208, after which he and his brother James came to Greece, where they received a fief at Erimokastro, the site of ancient
Thespiae
, west of
Thebes
.
[2]
[3]
According to F. Van Tricht, the fief may have formed part of the
Templar
possessions that were confiscated ca. 1209 by the
Latin Emperor
Henry of Flanders
.
[4]
In 1210, he was among the signatories of the concordat with the Latin Church at the
Second Parliament of Ravennika
.
[5]
Nicholas later married
Margaret of Hungary
, the widow of Boniface of Montferrat, who died in 1207.
[6]
It is unclear when the marriage took place: F. Van Tricht dates the marriage to after 1217,
[7]
Longnon "not before 1223" since at this date she is still mentioned as a widow.
[8]
[9]
According to Longnon, medieval sources may have confused Margaret with another Hungarian noblewoman, since she would have been quite old at the date of the purported marriage.
[8]
He had two sons,
Bela
and
William
. Bela would marry Bonne de La Roche, the sister of
Guy I
, the
Duke of Athens
, become lord of one half of Thebes, and lay the foundations for the rise of the Saint Omer family to a prominent position in Frankish Greece.
[3]
[6]
[10]
Nicholas died probably ca. 1235, as he is mentioned in a document dated March 1236-37 suggesting a recent death.

The
Leer Lutheran Church
, also known as the
Norwegian Lutheran Church
is a church located at 10430 South Leer Road, near Leer in
Long Rapids Township
,
Michigan
. The church grounds include a parish house, cemetery, and pavilion, as well as the church itself.  The church is substantially the same as when it was built.
[2]
Highlights include an altar painting by Sarah Kirkeberg Raugland, and an unusual pressed metal interior in the parish house.  It was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
in 2013.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
By the 1870s, the town of
Alpena
had a sizable
Norwegian
community, many members of which had recently emigrated from
Lier, Norway
.
[3]
With money from their lumbering jobs, members of the community purchased nearby land and founded the community of Leer, with the first permanent settlers arriving in the town in 1879.  In 1882, a Norwegian Lutheran Church Society was organized in Leer at the home of Andreas and Gunhild Christopherson.  The Reverend Peder lsberg, pastor of the Norwegian Lutheran congregation in Alpena, agreed to travel to Leer four times yearly for services.  The Leer congregation met in a local school, and started a building fund with the intention of constructing a church.
In 1883, the congregation purchased a plot of land for $1.00 from Karl Burud, on the condition that it be used for a church and cemetery.
[3]
The first burial in the cemetery occurred in 1885.  By 1898, the fund drive was nearing completion, and a building committee was appointed to determine construction details. The final design was based on a German Lutheran church (no longer extant) located in nearby
Krakow Township
in
Presque Isle County
.  The cornerstone of the church was laid on September 7, 1899, and the remainder of the church was constructed by carpenter Joseph F. Bammel for $3,000.  It was completed in 1900.
In 1916, a parish house was constructed for $800.
[3]
The parish house served as the social and educational center of the congregation.  The church was modernized in the 1930s and 1940s, with the addition of electrification, a water system, and updated heating.  Stained glass windows were installed in 1941-42. A single-story addition to the parish house was constructed in 1963.  As of 2014, the church is still being used for services.
[4]
Description
[
edit
]
The Norwegian Lutheran Church is a rectangular wood-frame vernacular
Gothic Revival
church, measuring 50 feet (15 m) by 31 feet (9.4 m), with a
gable
roof and a
fieldstone
and concrete foundation.
[3]
It has a centrally positioned, rectangular bell tower 63 feet (19 m) high that projects from the front facade.  The church entrance is in the base of the tower and is reached via a set of concrete steps.  Above the entrance is a single stained glass window.  Similar windows line the longer sides of the church. The church was originally constructed of local materials, but is presently clad in white vinyl siding.
Inside the church entrance is a small vestibule, along with a cry room and restroom (converted from a former coat room), beyond which is the entrance to the nave. The nave has two rows of eight oak pews with a center aisle. In the front are the chancel, altar, and pulpit, which are flanked by the pastor's dressing room, and another vestibule leading to a rear exit.  A balcony is in the rear of the church.  The original wood floor is covered with carpeting.  Perhaps the most unusual
[
peacock prose
]
aspect of the interior is the altar painting,
Crucifixion
, by Sarah Kirkeberg Raugland, which is attached to the rear wall of the chancel.
A two-story parish house is situated adjacent to the church.
[3]
It is a wood-frame structure with a
gambrel roof
and concrete block foundation, approximately 40 feet (12 m) by 27 feet (8.2 m).  It is clad with vinyl siding, and has a main entrance reached by ten concrete steps.  A later single-story addition projects to one side.
The upper floor of the historic section of the parish house is a single open space, and is in substantially original condition.
[3]
The walls and ceiling are covered with elaborate embossed and painted pressed metal panels.  The metal panels form wainscoting and an upper rail, and transition to different patterns above the rail.  An oak staircase connects the upper floor to the lower.  The lower floor, which has been significantly modernized, houses a kitchen, dining and social space, bathroom, and a small office.
The cemetery fronts the church property, and contains upright, flat, and obelisk headstones, crafted from granite and marble.
[3]
Various cedars, yews, pines, and shrubs area scattered throughout the property.  A modern pavilion is also located near the church.  This structure is an open air gabled structure, with the roof supported by wooden posts sitting on a concrete pad, and an enclosed kitchen and utility facility on one end.  The pavilion is modern, built to take the place of the original horse stalls.

History
[
edit
]
The present
lighthouse
was erected in 1908, but the first proposal to build a lighthouse here was made in 1825 by
Trinity House
. The lighthouse replaces a light-vessel previously moored in the south of
Cardigan Bay
. The lighthouse is similar in construction to
Skokholm Lighthouse
and is among the last lighthouses to be built in
Britain
.
The circular stone tower is 55 ft high and still contains the original lantern complete with
Fresnel lens
manufactured by
Chance Brothers
, using a mercury bath as a low-friction bearing. Illumination was updated from
paraffin
to electricity in 1949. The Lighthouse was fully electrified in 1965. The Lighthouse was fully automated in 1980 and is now monitored from the
Trinity House
Operations Control Centre at Harwich with regular visits made by an attendant.
A plaque in the lantern-room is inscribed with a verse from
Psalm
127:
Except the Lord Build the house
They labour in vain that build it
Except the Lord keep the city
The Watchman waketh but in vain
Under the lantern room sits a water tank which was used to store rainfall for use in the lighthouse's accommodation. The Lighthouse was reached by an iron bridge, and a handrail on the bridge and steps formed part pipe siphoning fuel mainland. Parts of the apparatus still survive. The bridge was replaced in 1963. An electric fog-signal was installed in 1969, replacing the previous system that used explosive signal charges. Stores were transferred from the mainland by cable but now largely arrive by helicopter and a helipad is found to the west of the lighthouse.
Those familiar with transatlantic aviation may recognize the name from Strumble
VOR
.

Jana Horáková
(born 4 September 1983 in
Prostějov
) is a Czech professional
BMX
cyclist.
[1]
Having started BMX racing at age fifteen, Horakova has claimed numerous Czech national titles, eight European championship titles (a conglomerate of under-12, junior, and elite), and more importantly, two bronze medals in the women's elite category at the
UCI World Championships
(2002 and 2007).
[2]
[3]
She also represented her nation
Czech Republic
at the
2008 Summer Olympics
, and has been racing professionally for most of her sporting career on the Suzuki-RB Team, before signing an exclusive, three-year sponsorship contract with Duratec in 2010.
[4]
Horakova qualified for the Czech squad, as a lone female rider, in
women's BMX cycling
at the
2008 Summer Olympics
in
Beijing
by receiving an automatic berth from the Czech Cycling Union based on her top-ten performance at the
UCI
BMX World Rankings.
[5]
After she surprisingly grabbed an eighth seed on the morning prelims with a time of 38.077, Horakova could not match a stellar ride in her semifinal heat with 16 positioning points and a fifth-place finish, narrowly missing out the top-eight final by a two-point deficit.
[6]
[7]
[8]
In September 2011, Horakova had tested positive for the banned substance
clenbuterol
while participating in fourcross mountain biking at the World Championships. On 28 June 2012 the
Union Cycliste Internationale
had officially decided to order Horakova a two-year suspension from the
UCI World Championships
, and more importantly, from the
Olympic Games
in
London
, despite being appealed by the Czech Cycling Union earlier of that year.

U.S. Route 70
(abbreviated
US-70
) is a transcontinental
U.S. highway
extending from
Globe, Arizona
to
Atlantic, North Carolina
. Along the way, 289.81 miles (466.40 km) of its route passes through the state of
Oklahoma
. Entering the state south of
Davidson
, the highway serves Oklahoma's southern tier before exiting the state east of
Broken Bow
. It serves the cities of
Ardmore
,
Durant
,
Hugo
, and
Idabel
, as well as
Tillman
,
Cotton
,
Jefferson
,
Carter
,
Marshall
,
Bryan
,
Choctaw
, and
McCurtain
counties.
US-70 was first established in Oklahoma in 1926. The highway's initial path (which entered the state in Cotton County, further east than it does today) included several deviations from the present-day route, serving
Walters
and following a more northerly course between Ardmore and
Madill
. US-70 did not enter Tillman County until 1945. The modern route between Ardmore and Madill was not established until 1984 when it received the US-70 designation.
Route description
[
edit
]
US-70 enters Oklahoma in
Tillman County
, crossing the
Red River
from Texas,
concurrent
with
US-183
. The two routes head north into
Davidson
, where they split; US-183 continues north toward the
county seat
of
Frederick
, while US-70 turns due east. It leaves Davidson, passing south of the
Hackberry Flat Wildlife Management Area
. Approximately
11
+
1
⁄
2
miles (18.5 km) east of Davidson, the highway serves as the southern terminus of
State Highway 54
(SH-54), which connects US-70 to
Hollister
. Continuing east from the SH-54 junction, US-70 next enters
Grandfield
, where it begins a concurrency with
SH-36
. The two highways proceed east from this junction, leaving Tillman County, US-70 having traveled for 30.78 miles (49.54 km) within its boundaries.
[3]
US-70/SH-36 pass into
Cotton County
, heading southeast along the southern limit of
Devol
, which is served by SH-70B, a spur from US-70. US-70 and SH-36 turn back to the east, coming to a junction about four miles (6.4 km) east of Devol, where SH-36 splits away to the south. US-70 then comes to an interchange with
Interstate 44
(I-44).
[4]
This interchange, I-44 exit 5, is the southern terminus of the
H. E. Bailey Turnpike
.
US-277
and
US-281
exit the Interstate at this point, forming a triple concurrency with US-70 as it continues east toward
Randlett
.
[5]
There, the three routes serve as the southern terminus of SH-70C. At the southeast corner of the Randlett limits, US-277/US-281 turn north, while US-70 continues on its due east course. At
Taylor
, seven miles (11 km) east of Randlett, US-70 meets
SH-5B
at its southern terminus. Further to the east, US-70 serves as the southern terminus of another state highway,
SH-65
. US-70 then exits Cotton County.
[4]
The next county US-70 enters in Oklahoma is
Jefferson County
. The highway enters the county seat,
Waurika
, about five miles (8.0 km) east of the Cotton-Jefferson county line. On the southwestern outskirts of town, the route is the northern terminus of
SH-79
, which connects US-70 to
SH-79
in Texas. US-70 runs along the southern edge of Waurika, coming to the eastern terminus of
SH-5
and intersecting
US-81
. Leaving town, it proceeds due east across unincorporated Jefferson County for about 21 miles (34 km). The highway then cuts through
Cornish
and
Ringling
, intersecting
SH-89
in the latter town. US-70 passes into
Carter County
east of Ringling.
[6]
US-70 heads due east on an arrow-straight route for the next
22
+
1
⁄
2
miles (36.2 km) across Carter County.
[7]
About
3
+
1
⁄
2
miles (5.6 km) east of the county line, the highway passes through unincorporated
Zaneis
,
[8]
where it widens to a four-lane divided highway.
[5]
South of
Healdton
, it is joined by
SH-76
, which follows US-70 for approximately
2
+
1
⁄
2
miles (4.0 km) before splitting away to the south in
Wilson
. To the east, US-70 junctions with SH-70A, which heads south to link to SH-76 in downtown Wilson. US-70 then passes through
Lone Grove
before entering
Ardmore
. It meets
I-35
at a cloverleaf interchange (exit 31) on the city's west side. Here, eastbound US-70 joins southbound I-35, while
SH-199
toward downtown Ardmore begins straight ahead. US-70 exits from the interstate at exit 29, turning back to the east and intersecting with
US-77
. US-70 passes north of
Lake Murray
, cutting across the northern reaches of Lake Murray State Park and intersecting the main lake access road,
SH-77S
, twice. East of the lake, the highway leaves Carter County.
[8]
After leaving Carter County, US-70 enters the smallest of Oklahoma's 77 counties,
Marshall County
. After crossing the county line, the highway heads due east for 11 miles (18 km), passing through
Oakland
and then entering the county seat,
Madill
. On the north side of the city, US-70 approaches a T intersection with
US-177
and SH-199; this is the southern terminus of US-177. US-70 turns south, forming a concurrency with SH-199. The two highways head toward downtown Madill, where SH-199 splits off. At the same intersection, US-377/
SH-99
join US-70 as it continues south through Madill, splitting away on the south edge of town. US-70 turns southeast, forming the northern terminus of SH-70F before reaching
Kingston
. There, US-70 intersects several highways at their termini—
SH-32
, SH-70B (a spur to
Lake Texoma
), and SH-70A (a spur to
New Woodville
and
McBride
).
[9]
US-70 curves back to the east in Kingston, entering Lake Texoma State Park east of town and crossing the
Washita River
arm of the lake, which forms the eastern boundary of Marshall County.
[8]
Upon reaching the lakeshore, US-70 touches down on
Bryan County
soil. US-70 heads east, passing along the southern edge of
Mead
, then enters the city of
Durant
, the county seat. On the west side of town, it intersects US-70 Bypass, a partial bypass freeway around the western and southern sides of the city. It then has an interchange with the
US-69
/
US-75
freeway before heading into downtown Durant. There, it has brief concurrencies with
US-69 BUS
and
SH-78
. US-70 then heads east out of town. In
Bokchito
, it is the eastern terminus of
SH-22
. US-70 then proceeds to
Bennington
, where it intersects SH-70E at its eastern terminus. US-70 heads northeast out of Bennington, then turns back to a due east course to enter
Choctaw County
.
[10]
SH-209 directional assembly along US-70
The first town US-70 serves in Choctaw County is
Boswell
, where it junctions with
SH-109
at that highway's western terminus. US-70 then bisects unincorporated
Unger
and
Jasper
, as well as the town of
Soper
. East of Soper, the route forms a concurrency with
US-271
. The two highways come to an interchange with the
Indian Nation Turnpike
on the western outskirts of the county seat,
Hugo
. This interchange is the southern terminus of the turnpike; US-70 and US-271 merge onto the freeway continuing south from the turnpike, while
US-70 BUS
and
US-271 BUS
continue east into town. US-70 and US-271 follow the bypass around the southwestern quadrant of town. On the southern edge of Hugo, the highways intersect US-271 BUS at its other terminus; here, US-271 splits away from US-70 and heads south.
[11]
This marks the end of the freeway; US-70 continues east as a four-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections. US-70 meets the eastern terminus of US-70 BUS on the eastern outskirts of Hugo.
[5]
At the eastern limit of town, US-70 meets
SH-93
at its southern terminus. The highway then leaves Hugo, passing through unincorporated
Fallon
and entering
Sawyer
, where it forms the southern terminus of
SH-147
. Just to the east of Sawyer is
Fort Towson
. There, US-70 serves as the eastern terminus of SH-109 and the northern terminus of
SH-209
. The highway continues east, serving unincorporated
Swink
, before leaves Choctaw County.
[11]
The easternmost county US-70 serves in Oklahoma is
McCurtain County
. The road heads southeast, passing through
Valliant
, before intersecting
SH-98
west of
Millerton
. East of SH-98, US-70 bisects Millerton, then continues southeast through
Garvin
. It then reaches the county seat,
Idabel
; here,
US-70 BYP
heads along the west and southwest sides of the city, while mainline US-70 continues east across the northern reaches of the Idabel city limits. In the northeast corner of town, US-70 intersects
US-259
/
SH-3
, turning north to form a concurrency with them (with eastbound US-70 and westbound SH-3 overlapping to form a
wrong-way concurrency
). The highways proceed to
Broken Bow
, where they go their separate ways; SH-3 turns west, US-259 continues north, and US-70 turns east.
[12]
US-70 reaches the state line west of
DeQueen, Arkansas
; after crossing the line, it passes into
Sevier County, Arkansas
.
[8]
History
[
edit
]
US-70 was originally designated in Oklahoma on December 7, 1926, as part of the initial slate of U.S. highways established through the state.
[1]
US-70 initially entered Oklahoma east of
Burkburnett, Texas
, proceeded northeast to Randlett, then continued north to an intersection with SH-5 near
Emerson
, where it turned east, passing through
Walters
. From Walters, it continued due east into
Stephens County
to
Comanche
along present-day
SH-53
; in Comanche, it turned south along US-81, running through
Addington
before meeting the present-day US-70 route in Waurika. From Waurika, US-70 followed its present-day route to Ardmore. US-70 continued east from Ardmore along present-day SH-199 and US-177, passing through
Dickson
and
Mannsville
before reuniting with the present-day route in Madill. East of Madill, US-70 followed the same basic pathway that it does today.
[13]
In 1936, US-70 was realigned in Cotton and Jefferson counties. A section of
SH-32
between Randlett and Waurika was also designated as US-70. The old alignment from west of Randlett, through Emerson and Walters, to Comanche, was given the additional designation of
U.S. Route 70N
on September 1, 1936. East of Comanche, US-70N followed SH-53 through
Loco
to an intersection with SH-76 south of
Fox
; US-70N turned south along SH-76, passing through Healdton and ending at the US-70 junction south of town.
[1]
[14]
This route was relatively short-lived, however; it appeared on the April 1937 official state map but was absent from the April 1938 map.
[15]
On March 3, 1945, US-70's extent through Oklahoma was greatly expanded. On this date, the highway was realigned between
Oklaunion, Texas
and Randlett; rather than entering Oklahoma near Burkburnett, the US-70 turned north along US-183 in Oklaunion, entering Oklahoma between there and Davidson, before turning east and proceeding along SH-32 to Randlett. SH-32 would remain designated along US-70 between Randlett and Waurika until September 6, 1966.
[1]
[16]
Between 1945 and 1951, US-70, SH-32, and SH-36's course between Grandfield and Randlett was more indirect than its modern path, including several right-angle turns. This was remedied on September 10, 1951, with the three highways being shifted to a path following a straighter southeasterly course between the two towns.
[1]
[17]
During the 1980s, US-70 saw several substantial realignments. On July 14, 1981, the highway was rerouted to bypass Hugo; the old route through town became US-70 BUS. Three years later, on July 7, 1984, US-70 was shifted to its present-day alignment between Ardmore and Madill. After these realignments, the highway followed the same basic path that it does today, with no major changes after 1984.

The
UK Singles Chart
is a music chart compiled by the
Official Charts Company
that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom.
[1]
Since 2005, the chart has been based on the sales of both
physical
and
digital
singles, originally on the condition that the single was available in both formats. In 2007, the rules were changed so that legal downloads of all songs, irrespective of whether a physical copy was available, were eligible to chart.
[2]
Between 2000 and 2009, ten singles that reached the top of the singles chart sold more than 1 million copies in the United Kingdom.
[3]
At the end of the decade, a retrospective chart was compiled by the Official Charts Company to determine the best-selling single of this ten-year period. The title was won by
Will Young
, the winner of the televised talent competition
Pop Idol
in 2001, with his
double A-side
single "
Evergreen
"/"
Anything Is Possible
", released in 2002.
[4]
The single sold just under 1.8 million copies and saw Young finish ahead of fellow
Pop Idol
finalist
Gareth Gates
, whose debut single "
Unchained Melody
" sold 1.34 million copies.
[5]
Young's single included sales of 1,108,269 copies in its first week, at the time a first-week total that had been bettered only by
Elton John
's "
Candle in the Wind 1997
".
[6]
The X Factor
winners
Alexandra Burke
(5th), and
Shayne Ward
(8th) and the band formed on
Popstars
in 2001,
Hear'Say
(9th), also reached the top ten.
[7]
Kylie Minogue
,
Shaggy
and
Tony Christie
were the other solo artists who made the top ten of best-selling singles; Christie's best-seller was a charity single recorded for
Comic Relief
in 2005. Children's television character
Bob the Builder
's "
Can We Fix It?
", voiced by
Neil Morrissey
, and
Band Aid 20
's cover of "
Do They Know It's Christmas
" made up the rest of the top ten singles.
[3]
[8]
The chart is significantly skewed towards singles released at the beginning (2000-2002) and end (2007-2009) of the decade. Digital downloads were included in the charts for the first time in 2005, but it took several years before the download figures made up for the loss of physical single sales.
[9]
Only six songs released in 2003 and two released in 2004 (including
Band Aid 20
's million-seller "
Do They Know It's Christmas?
") made the top 100 best-selling singles, compared with twelve in 2000 and thirteen in 2009. Following changes to the chart ruling in 2007,
Rage Against the Machine
's 1993 single "
Killing in the Name
" was declared the
Christmas number-one
on the strength of an Internet campaign on the
Facebook
website, even though it did not have a contemporary physical release.
[10]
[11]
The song eventually reached number 35 on the best-sellers list.
BBC Radio 1
announced the chart across three programmes, presented by
DJ Nihal
, between 29 December and 31 December 2009.
[12]
The list of best-selling albums of the decade in the UK
was also announced in a show on 28 December 2009.
[12]
As it was broadcast during the last week of December, the chart did not include sales from the final week of the year. An updated chart, including sales up to 31 December 2009 was published in the UK trade magazine
Music Week
in the issue dated 30 January 2010.
[13]
Apart from some unsurprising rises in the positions of songs from 2009, this updated chart included some major changes to the one broadcast on Radio 1. "
Gotta Get Thru This
" by
Daniel Bedingfield
dropped from 61 to 71, "
Anyone of Us (Stupid Mistake)
" by Gareth Gates fell from 57 to 61, "
Angel
" by Shaggy fell from 44 to 54, "
A Little Less Conversation
" by
Elvis
vs
JXL
was moved from 31 to 38, and most notably,
the Black Eyed Peas
' "
Where Is the Love?
" dropped from 25 to 42. "
How You Remind Me
" by
Nickelback
and "
Do You Really Like It?
" by
DJ Pied Piper and the Masters of Ceremonies
dropped out of the top 100 altogether.
One other notable omission from the chart is "
Toca's Miracle
" by
Fragma
. According to the OCC, then known as the Chart Information Network (CIN), the single was the seventh best-selling single of 2000, selling 530,742 copies.
[14]
However, it was not included in the chart of the best-selling singles of the 2000s, despite the inclusion of several of the singles immediately below it in the 2000 best-sellers list, and it is also missing from the official list of the 150 best-selling singles of the 21st century to date that was announced in 2012.
[15]
Most appearances in the chart goes to the Black Eyed Peas and
Eminem
with four entries, followed by
S Club 7
, Gareth Gates and
Leona Lewis
with three entries each.

Dhritiman Chatterjee
is an Indian actor. He began his acting career in 1970 as the protagonist of
Satyajit Ray
's
Pratidwandi
(
The Adversary
).
[1]
Most of his acting work has been in India's "parallel", or independent, cinema with filmmakers such as
Satyajit Ray
,
Mrinal Sen
and
Aparna Sen
, among others and is noted for his acting skills.
[2]
[3]
He has also worked in
English
films with well-known filmmakers such as
Deepa Mehta
and
Jane Campion
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Dhritiman is his screen name. He is otherwise known as Sundar Chatterjee and is quite active on the English stage in Chennai. Born on 30 May 1945, he was educated at Kolkata's St Xavier's Collegiate School and Presidency College, and the Delhi School of Economics. Chatterjee went on to pursue a parallel career in
advertising
, social communications and
documentary filmmaking
.
Career
[
edit
]
In 2019, Chatterjee lent his voice for narration in
If Not for You
,
[4]
a documentary about
Kolkata
's long lasting love affair with legendary singer-songwriter
Bob Dylan
. About his acting qualities, Satyajit Ray once remarked, "I do not know what definition of a star these filmmakers have been using, but mine goes something like this. A star is a person on the screen who continues to be expressive and interesting even after he or she has stopped doing anything. This definition does not exclude the rare and lucky breed that gets lakhs of rupees per film; and it includes everyone who keeps his calm before the camera, projects a personality and evokes empathy. This is a rare breed too but one has met it in our films. Dhritiman Chatterjee of Pratidwandi is such a star." - (
Our Films Their Films
)
[5]
Never a part of mainstream "Bollywood", he's made an astonishingly small number of films. In recent years he's taken roles with filmmakers as diverse as Jane Campion and hugely successful Mumbai directors Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Mani Ratnam.
[6]
Dhritiman has received several acting awards in India and has been on the Jury of the Indian National film Awards.
He is currently the anchor of
Pradhanmantri

Bengali
on
ABP Ananda
from 14 December 2013.

John Mowlem (rugby player)
.
John Mowlem
John Mowlem
(12 October 1788 - 8 March 1868) was an
English
stonemason
, builder and founder of the
quarrying
and
construction
company "Mowlem, Burt and Freeman".
Career
[
edit
]
Mowlem was born in
Swanage
,
Dorset
, the son of a
quarryman
.  As a young man, he worked in the quarries of the
Isle of Purbeck
: he was reputedly one of the last people to work in the quarry at
Tilly Whim
and, as a
stonemason
, on the
Isle of Wight
.
[1]
He travelled to
London
in 1807 where he started working for Henry Westmacott, the Government mason and builder, as a general foreman: Mowlem personally worked on
Nelson
's Tomb in
St Paul's Cathedral
,
Somerset House
and the
Royal Mews
at Charing Cross.
[2]
In 1812 he married Susannah Manwell, the daughter of another Swanage man. In 1822 he set up business as a paving contractor and stone merchant, building up a large business and paving
Blackfriars Bridge
amongst other areas. In 1839 Mowlem moved briefly to
Guernsey
, which was the source of much of the
granite
used by his business.  He left the London side of the business in the care of
George Burt
(his wife's nephew), and Joseph Freeman (Burt's brother-in-law).  By 1845 the two men had joined Mowlem as partners, and the company (aided by Mowlem's purchase and management of Guernsey quarries) had won several large contracts, including the maintenance of the masonry of all government property in the London district.
[3]
Once Burt and Freeman had been taken on as partners, Mowlem moved back to Swanage, but maintained an interest in the business as well as acting philanthropically within the town of his birth.  He died in 1868, childless, and the business, which ultimately became known simply as
Mowlem
passed on to Burt.

Hope
was a
galleon
of the
English
navy
, built in 1559. She was rebuilt in 1583 "into the form of a
galleass
", and then again rebuilt from 1603 to 1604 when she was renamed
Assurance
.
[Note 1]
Following her first rebuilding, she was mentioned in the Paris archives as part of
Elizabeth I
's fleet in 1588 in
A Statement of the two fleets possessed by the Queen of England, with numbers and names of the ships
, in which she was listed as "400 tons, 17 pieces each side, four pieces at the prow and the same at the stern." Her complement was 250 comprising 150 mariners, 30 gunners and 70 soldiers. The ship was under the command of
Drake
in 1588 - "Drake has also six large ships of the Queen's, namely :—the
Revenge
, the
Hope
, the
Nonpareil
, the
Swiftsure
, the
Aid
and the
Advice
, with 45 of the best merchant ships they could select, at the Isle of Wight." In October 1602 as part of Sir
Robert Mansell
's small fleet he intercepted and with the help of Dutch warships defeated six Spanish galleys in a
battle in the Dover Straits
.
In 1603-04 she was rebuilt a second time as a
great ship
(or
second rank
), and renamed
Assurance
. Now of 451 tons, she carried 34 primary guns (2 cannon periers, 10 culverins, 12 demi-culverins and 10 sakers) and 4 smaller and more anti-personnel weapons (fowlers).
[1]
She was sold out of the navy in late 1645.

Biography
[
edit
]
Torp was born in
Kristiania
(now Oslo), Norway.  He was the son of Hjalmar Torp (1856-1922) and his wife Marie Fredrikke Severine Vaumund (1859-1946). He was a brother of  architect
Ernst Torp
and the uncle of his sons architects,
Fredrik Torp
and
Niels A. Torp
.
[2]
He attended
Statens håndverks- og kunstindustriskole
(now
Oslo National Academy of the Arts
) during 1915 and 1920-21. During the studies he was assistant at the architects Morgenstierne & Eide in Kristiania 1920-21. He conducted  engineering studies at the
Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts
(
Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi
) in
Copenhagen
during 1923 followed by an architectural degree in 1924. He also conducted study trips to
Italy
,
Germany
and
France
.
[3]
[4]
After his studies, he was employed as building adviser at Gamlehjem Oslo 1924-25. Together with his brother Ernst,  Torp ran the architect company
Torp & Torp
from 1930. He designed a number of buildings and neighbourhoods in
Oslo
. These included
Briskebyhagen
(1926) and
Nobels gate 11
(1929), and along with his brother,
Torstedgården
,
Ingar Nilsens løkke
at
Skøyen
,
Stensbergløkken
,
Hoff terrasse
, and
Kong Oscars Minde
. He also designed
Møllerhøvik
(
Bærum
) and
Wrightegården
(
Langesund
).
[2]
[5]
The architectural firm continued in 1984 as Niels Torp AS Architects MNAL. Niels A. Torp was the son of Ernst Torp and had been employed by Torp & Torp since 1965. Another son, Fredrik Torp, also worked for the company before joining Telje Torp Aasen Arkitektkontor AS in 1965.

Medical condition
Postterm pregnancy
Other names
Postterm, postmaturity, prolonged pregnancy, post-dates pregnancy, postmature birth
Specialty
Obstetrics
Postterm pregnancy
is when a woman has not yet delivered her baby after 42 weeks of
gestation
, two weeks beyond the typical 40-week duration of pregnancy.
[1]
Postmature births carry risks for both the mother and the baby, including fetal malnutrition,
meconium aspiration syndrome
, and
stillbirths
.
[2]
After the 42nd week of gestation, the
placenta
, which supplies the baby with nutrients and oxygen from the mother, starts aging and will eventually fail. Postterm pregnancy is a reason to
induce labor
.
[3]
Definitions
[
edit
]
The management of labor and delivery may vary depending on the gestational age. It is common to encounter the following terms when describing different time periods of pregnancy.
[4]
Postterm - ≥ 42 weeks + 0 days of gestation (> 293 days from the first day of last menstrual period, or > 13 days from the estimated due date)
Late term - 41 weeks + 0 days to 41 weeks + 6 days of gestation
Full term - 39 weeks + 0 days to 40 weeks + 6 days of gestation
Early term - 37 weeks + 0 days to 38 weeks + 6 days of gestation
Preterm - ≤ 36 weeks + 6 days of gestation
[5]
Besides postterm pregnancy, other terminologies have been used to describe the same condition (≥ 42w+0d), such as prolonged pregnancy, postdates, and postdatism.
[6]
However, these terminologies are less commonly used to avoid confusion.
[7]
Postterm pregnancy should not be confused with postmaturity, postmaturity syndrome, or dysmaturity. These terms describe the neonatal condition that may be caused by postterm pregnancy instead of the duration of pregnancy.
[6]
Signs and symptoms
[
edit
]
Because postterm pregnancy is a condition solely based on gestational age, there are no confirming physical signs or symptoms. While it is difficult to determine gestational age physically, infants that are born postterm may be associated with a physical condition called
postmaturity
. The most common symptoms for this condition are dry skin, overgrown nails, creases on the baby's palms and soles of their feet, minimal fat, abundant hair on their head, and either a brown, green, or yellow discoloration of their skin. Doctors diagnose postmature birth based on the baby's physical appearance and the length of the mother's pregnancy.
[8]
However, some postmature babies may show no or few signs of postmaturity.
Baby
[
edit
]
Reduced
placental perfusion
- Once a pregnancy has surpassed the 40-week gestation period, doctors closely monitor the mother for signs of placental deterioration. Toward the end of pregnancy,
calcium
is deposited on the walls of blood vessels, and proteins are deposited on the surface of the
placenta
, which changes the placenta. This limits the blood flow through the placenta and ultimately leads to
placental insufficiency
, and the baby is no longer properly nourished. Induced labor is strongly encouraged if this happens.
[9]
Oligohydramnios
- Low volume of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. It is associated with complications such as cord compression, abnormal heart rate, fetal acidosis, and meconium amniotic fluid.
[10]
Meconium aspiration syndrome
- Respiratory compromise secondary to meconium present in infant's lungs.
[11]
Macrosomia
- Excessive birth weight, estimated fetal weight of ≥ 4.5 kg. It can further increase the risk of
prolonged labor
and
shoulder dystocia
.
[6]
Shoulder dystocia
- Difficulty in delivering the shoulders due to increased body size.
[12]
Increased
forceps
-assisted or
vacuum
-assisted birth - When postterm babies are larger than average, forceps or vacuum delivery may be used to resolve the difficulties at the delivery time, such as shoulder dystocia.
[13]
Complications include lacerations, skin markings, external eye trauma, intracranial injury, facial nerve injury, skull fracture, and rarely death.
[14]
[15]
[16]
[17]
Mother
[
edit
]
Increased
labor induction
- Induction may be needed if labor progression is abnormal. Oxytocin, a medication used in induction, may have side effects such as low blood pressure.
[18]
Increased forceps assisted or vacuum assisted birth - operative vaginal deliveries increase maternal risks of genital trauma.
[19]
Increased
Caesarean
birth - Postterm babies may be larger than an average baby, thus increasing the length of labor. The labor is increased because the baby's head is too big to pass through the mother's pelvis. This is called
cephalopelvic disproportion
. Caesarean sections are encouraged if this happens.
[20]
Complications include bleeding, infection, abnormal wound healing, abnormal placenta in future pregnancies, and rarely death.
[21]
A 2019 randomized control trial of induced labor at 42 or 43 weeks was terminated early due to statistical evidence of "significantly increased risk for women induced at the start of week 43". The study implies clinical guidelines for induction of labor no later than at 41 gestational weeks.
[22]
Causes
[
edit
]
The causes of post-term births are unknown, but postmature births are more likely when the mother has experienced a previous postmature birth. Due dates are easily miscalculated when the mother is unsure of her last menstrual period. When there is a miscalculation, the baby could be delivered before or after the expected due date.
[23]
Postmature births can also be attributed to irregular menstrual cycles. When the menstrual period is irregular it is difficult to judge the moment of ovulation and subsequent fertilization and pregnancy. Some postmature pregnancies may not be postmature in reality due to the uncertainty of mother's last menstrual period.
[3]
However, in most countries where gestation is measured by ultrasound scan technology, this is less likely.
[

Monitoring
[
edit
]
Once a pregnancy is diagnosed postterm, usually at or greater than 42 weeks of
gestational age
, the mother should be offered additional monitoring as this can provide valuable clues that the fetal health is being maintained.
[24]
Fetal movement recording
[
edit
]
Regular movements of the fetus is the best sign indicating that it is still in good health. The mother should keep a "kick-chart" to record the movements of her fetus. If there is a reduction in the number of movements it could indicate placental deterioration.
[25]
Doppler fetal monitor
[
edit
]
Doppler fetal monitor is a hand-held device that is routinely used in prenatal care. When it is used correctly, it can quickly measure the fetal heart rate. The baseline of fetal heart rate is typically between 110 and 160 beats per minute.
[26]
Doppler flow study
[
edit
]
Doppler flow study is a type of ultrasound that measures the amount of blood flowing in and out of the placenta.
[13]
The ultrasound machine can also detect the direction of blood flow and display it in red or blue. Usually, a red color indicates a flow toward the ultrasound transducer, while blue indicates a flow away from the transducer. Based on the display, doctors can evaluate blood flow to the umbilical arteries, umbilical veins, or other organs such as heart and brain.
[27]
Nonstress test
[
edit
]
Nonstress test
(NST) is a type of electronic fetal monitoring that uses a
cardiotocograph
to monitor fetal heartbeat, fetal movement and mother's contraction. NST is typically monitored for at least 20 minutes. Signs of a reactive (normal) NST include a baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) between 110 and 160 beats per minute (bpm) and 2 accelerations of FHR of at least 15 bpm above baseline for over 15 seconds.
Vibroacoustic stimulation
and longer monitoring may be needed if NST is non-reactive.
[28]
Biophysical profile
[
edit
]
A
biophysical profile
is a noninvasive procedure that uses the ultrasound to evaluate the fetal health based on NST and four ultrasound parameters: fetal movement, fetal breathing, fetal muscle tone, and the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. A score of 2 points is given for each category that meets the criteria or 0 points if the criteria are not met (no 1 point). Sometimes, the NST is omitted, making the highest score 8/8 instead of 10/10. Generally, a score of 8/10 or 10/10 is considered a normal test result, unless 0 points is given for amniotic fluid. A score of 6/10 with normal amniotic fluid is considered equivocal, and a repeated test within 24 hours may be needed. A score of 4/10 or less is considered abnormal, and delivery may be indicated.
[29]
Low amniotic fluid can cause pinching umbilical cord, decreasing blood flow to the fetus. Therefore, a score of 0 points for amniotic fluid may indicate the fetus is at risk.
[30]
Management
[
edit
]
Expectant
[
edit
]
A woman who has reached 42 weeks of pregnancy is likely to be offered induction of labour. Alternatively, she can choose expectant management, that is, she waits for the natural onset of labour. Women opting for expectant management may also choose to carry on with additional monitoring of their baby, with regular CTG, ultrasound, and biophysical profile. Risks of expectant management vary between studies.
[31]
In many places in the World, according to the
World Health Organization
and others, such services are rudimentary or not available, and
.
Inducing labor
[
edit
]
Main article:
Labor induction
Inducing labor artificially starts the labor process by using medication and other techniques. Labor is usually only induced if there is potential danger on the mother or child.
[32]
There are several reasons for labor induction; the mother's water breaks, and contractions have not started, the child is postmature, the mother has diabetes or high blood pressure, or there is not enough amniotic fluid around the baby.
[33]
Labor induction is not always the best choice because it has its own risks. Sometimes mothers will request to be induced for reasons that are not medical. This is called an elective induction. Doctors try to avoid inducing labor unless it is completely necessary.
[32]
Procedure
[
edit
]
There are four common methods of starting contractions. The four most common are stripping the membranes, breaking the mother's water, giving the hormone
prostaglandin
, and giving the synthetic hormone
pitocin
. Stripping the membranes does not work for all women, but can for most.
[34]
[35]
A doctor inserts a finger into the mother's cervix and moves it around to separate the membrane connecting the amniotic sac, which houses the baby, from the walls of the uterus. Once this membrane is stripped, the hormone prostaglandin is naturally released into the mother's body and initiates contractions.
[32]
Most of the time doing this only once will not immediately start labor. It may have to be done several times before the stimulant hormone is released, and contractions start.
[36]
The next method is breaking the mother's water, which is also referred to as an amniotomy. The doctor uses a plastic hook to break the membrane and rupture the amniotic sac. Within a few hours labor usually begins. Giving the hormone prostaglandin ripens the cervix, meaning the cervix softens, thins out, or dilates. The drug Cervidil is administered by mouth in tablet form or in gel form as an insert. This is most often done in the hospital overnight. The hormone oxytocin is usually given in the synthetic form of Pitocin. It is administered through an IV throughout the labor process. This hormone stimulates contractions. Pitocin is also used to "restart" labor when it is lagging.
[

The use of misoprostol is also allowed, but close monitoring of the mother is required.
[

Feelings
[
edit
]
Stripping the membranes: Stripping the membranes only takes a few minutes and causes a few intense cramps. Many women report a feeling similar to urination, others report it to be quite painful.
[
citation needed
]
Breaking the water: Having one's water broken feels like a slight tug and then a warm flow of liquid.
[
citation needed
]
Pitocin: When the synthetic hormone, pitocin, is used, contractions occur more frequently than a natural occurring birth; they are also more intense.

Epidemiology
[
edit
]
Prevalence of postterm pregnancy may vary between countries due to different population characteristics or medical management. Factors include number of first-time pregnancies, genetic predisposition, timing of ultrasound assessment, and Caesarean section rates, etc. The incidence is approximately 7%.
[6]
Postterm pregnancy occurs in 0.4% of pregnancies approximately in the United States according to birth certificate data.

Sakhi
(
Gurmukhi
: ਸਾਖੀ;
sākhī
) literally means 'historical account', 'anecdote', or 'story'. It is derived from the Sanskrit word
sākṣī
(साक्षी) which literally means 'witness'.
[1]
[2]
The term refers to the accounts of the historical events in
Sikhism
. It is a tale usually from the era during the times of the
Sikh Gurus
and their devoted followers and associates.
[3]
However, many Sakhis do exist from the period before and after the times of the
Ten Gurus
. Most Sakhis have a moral lesson and highlight important Sikh principles.
Compilation

Fontburn Halt
was a weatherboard and corrugated-iron-built railway station in
Northumberland
, England, on the
Rothbury Branch
, built to serve the pre-existing Whitehouse lime works
[1]
and later the Whitehouse Colliery, and quarries.
History
[
edit
]
In 1859 Parliament authorised the Wansbeck Railway Company to build the line from
Morpeth
to
Reedsmouth
. In 1862 the line from
Morpeth
to
Scotsgap
opened.
The next year the
Northumberland Central Railway
were authorised to construct a line from
Scotsgap
to Ford on the Berwick to Kelso line. They were also permitted to build a short branch line to Cornhill. Due to financial difficulties the line was to be built in stages
[2]
starting with the section from
Scotsgap
to
Rothbury
which was started in August 1869 and completed by November 1870. The
North British Railway
and the branch line became part of the
London and North Eastern Railway
in 1923. In September 1952 passenger services were withdrawn and the line closed in November 1963.
[3]
Constructed to serve Whitehouse lime works, the station later had a number of sidings serving various other local industries including the construction of the nearby
Fontburn
reservoir.

Type of Western-influenced traditional Thai music
Phleng Thai sakon
(
Thai
:
เพลงไทยสากล
;
transl.
international-style Thai music
) refers to Thai music in which traditional elements are blended with the use of Western notation and instruments. In the narrow sense, the term refers to the early movement in which this style of music was popularized. This roughly corresponds to the first half of the twentieth century, until the 1950s, when the style was split along cultural lines between the rural
luk thung
and the urban
luk krung
. In the wider sense, the term refers to all genres of Westernized Thai music (i.e. excluding folk and classical Thai), including
luk thung
,
luk krung
,
phleng phuea chiwit
and modern
Thai pop
(pop, luktung-pop, lukkwad-pop) and
rock
. As a genre, the most representative composer of
phleng Thai sakon
is
Eua Sunthornsanan
, who popularized the genre during the 1930s - 1940s.

Joseph Eastham School badge, 1961
Joseph Eastham High School
was a
comprehensive school
in
Salford
, England, built at the end of the 1950s by
Lancashire County Council
, and following reorganisation arising from the
Local Government Act 1972
, came under the auspices of
Salford City Council
. The school served the areas of
Little Hulton
,
Walkden
,
Worsley
and
Boothstown
, and was named after a well-respected Little Hulton grocer who lived on Hilton Lane where the school was sited, and had a shop on Smithfold Lane. Joseph Eastham was also a
Councillor
and
Alderman
who had a keen interest in educational provision and invested in local
billiard halls
and
youth clubs
.
The school hall, circa 1990
The original school buildings were designed by St. Annes architect Tom Mellor as a 450 place
secondary modern
. The first headteacher was Eric Livesey - "I arrived in 1960 but it wasn't opened until 1961, it was an absolute mess, unfinished chaos. There were workmen and plaster everywhere."
[1]
The building was enlarged in 1965 to accommodate 720, with further alterations in 1980 and 1990 to cater for 900 pupils, and finally in 1997 to provide for over a thousand pupils.
Local councillor and Little Hulton grocer, Joseph Eastham
The school also grew in reputation and became affectionately known as "Joey's". The maroon and blue striped school tie was the mainstay of school uniform. Plain grey pullovers or cardigans, black for fifth years, gave way in the 1990s to maroon jumpers displaying an embroidered school stag. The Joseph Eastham badge was created by the school's first art teacher who 'borrowed' the tongue-pulling stag's head from the crest of local nobleman, Lord Hulton, "Issuant out of a ducal coronet a hart's head and neck argent" and added a Lancashire rose "between two branches of hawthorn proper".
[2]
The school tie. More blue stripes were added in the 1990s
The school operated a five form entry with pupils joining one of four houses Edinburgh, Cornwall, York and Kent, later changed to three houses,Tudor, Stuart and Windsor.  - When the school grew to eight form entry in the 1990s, a fifth house, Lancaster, was added. The school had extensive playing fields, and its Soccer, Hockey, Rugby, Rounders, Volleyball, Cricket, Netball and Athletics teams established an enviable reputation in Salford leagues and competitions, many Joseph Eastham pupils representing Salford at national level. The annual
Sports Day
enabled the Houses to compete against each other watched by cheering crowds freed from lessons for the occasion.
The school had a tradition of educational visits and holidays, most notably long-standing activity holidays at Westward Ho! in Devon, Lyme Regis in Dorset, Barry Island in South Wales, the Isle of Wight, water sports holidays in Spain and France, visits to Italy and Austria, trips to Disneyland Paris, and camping in the Lake District. The 1970s and 1980s also saw a rise in the number of after school and lunchtime clubs being offered including: Art, Brass Band, Chess, Choir, Christian Union, Cross Country Running, Drama, Gardening, Gymnastics, Philately, Railway Modelling, Steel Band, and Trampolining.
Eric Livesey retired in 1982 and his deputy Kevin Comrie, who had joined the school in 1978, was appointed headteacher.
The school's three Headteachers - Eric Livesey, Kevin Comrie and Tony Walsh
The school fostered an enduring tradition of school plays, particularly musicals, including: The Last Reckoning (1976), Toad of Toad Hall (1977), The Wizard of Oz (1981), Oh, What a Lovely War (1981), Oliver (1983 and 1997), Our Day Out (1992 and 2001), Smithy (1993), Grease (1994), Blood Brothers (1995), Little Shop of Horrors (1998), and West Side Story (1999).

Profile was the slightly anarchic school magazine, a mix of humorous and serious content edited by older pupils, which gently poked fun at the teachers from 1977 to 1997 and won the
TV Times
Press Gang competition in 1989 earning the school a state-of-the-art Amiga 2000 computer. From 1995 to 2000, the school also published NewsLink for parents of pupils at the school.
The school's Art Department displayed work at nearby St. Ann's Hospice and in spare window space at Walkden
Tesco
(and the Scan supermarket that preceded it) who in return provided bags for the distribution of the
Harvest Festival
foods which pupils collected each year and distributed to the elderly of Little Hulton and Walkden, many of whom were also invited into school at Christmastime for a festive dinner and to be entertained by pupils. The Joseph Eastham
Steel Band
, in addition to performing regularly in school, performed at St. Ann's Hospice and Ellesmere Shopping Centre, and also represented Salford at the Northwest Schools' Prom held at Manchester's
Bridgewater Hall
in 1999.

The Carol Concert was a regular event, often with feeder primary schools providing an audience. Year group Christmas parties and discos were also regular features of Christmas at Joeys and other common events included Talent Shows and hugely popular Staff
Pantomimes
. Each year Joseph Eastham pupils collected money for a Christmas Charity, including the British Heart Foundation, a 'Pennies for Peru' appeal in support of a school for poor children in Lima, and raising enough money to buy and train a guide dog, a golden labrador that later visited the school with its owner. 'Rags to Riches' fancy dress and non-uniform days also became a regular focus of fun as well as charitable donation. Fundraising events organised by the school's
Parent Teachers' Association
included evening socials, fashion shows, and for many years a Summer Fete or Fayre was held in June on the school playing fields.

From the early 1980s, the Fifth Year Common Room provided a semi-informal base for senior pupils to assemble in the morning, socialise at break and lunchtime, and store personal possessions in lockers. Funds for equipment were initially raised by a sponsored walk the length of the nearby M602 motorway a month before its official opening in 1982. Table tennis, pool and chess were enthusiastically undertaken every lunchtime, annual trophies were awarded to tournament champions, with the
conkers
competition usually attracting the largest participation.
Joseph Eastham enjoyed considerable examination success, regarded by one Salford schools adviser as the best in the city when
contextual value added
factors were taken into consideration. Throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, the school's Attendance figures rivalled those of schools in more affluent areas of the city. In addition to operating a conventional prefect system where older pupils supervised areas at break and lunchtimes, the school also instigated an 'Adopt a Zone' initiative in which every form looked after an area of the school building, keeping corridors tidy and safe and ensuring that plants were watered and display boards undamaged.
At this time schools were becoming much more accountable to the Department for Education with all the additional paperwork that entailed.
Ofsted
was formed in 1992 and Joseph Eastham, one of the first 300 schools inspected, received an extremely favourable report with the chief inspector praising the school's
pastoral system
as 'second to none'. Kevin Comrie took early retirement at Christmas 1993 and commented in an interview with Profile, "the job has changed so much and has become so much more taxing".
[3]
The governors appointed Tony Walsh as headteacher from January 1994.
The fabric of the school building was beginning to show its age in the 1990s. Leaking roofs required countless buckets and expensive maintenance, and some serious flooding not only yielded an impromptu holiday on health and safety grounds, but quite possibly fuelled calls for a new school building funded by a
public-private partnership
. The school had suffered a string of thefts and burglaries in the late 1980s and 1990s, and in response an ugly but effective security fence was erected around the school grounds in 1997.
Joey's had long been at the forefront of Information Technology provision in Salford and was an early adopter of
Apple Macintosh
computers. By the end of the decade the school boasted four networked computer suites with over a hundred Apple and PC machines networked throughout the school. Joseph Eastham was greatly extended in 1997 and received a new Drama Studio, an additional Science Laboratory and a block of 10 new Maths, English and Modern Languages rooms. Despite such huge recent investment, in June 2000 Salford proposed the merger of Joseph Eastham and nearby Little Hulton Community School in order to "reduce surplus school places in Salford by between seven and 10 per cent"
[4]
and save money.
Although subsequent consultation confirmed that the proposed merger was unpopular among staff and pupils at both schools, and with parents, the
LEA
confirmed that the amalgamation would take place regardless. Joseph Eastham High School closed in summer 2001 and
Harrop Fold High School
was established in September 2001. The Joey's site housed the new school's younger pupils until a new building on the Hilton Lane playing fields was completed. The former Joseph Eastham High School buildings were demolished in the summer of 2008.

, high on a hillside on the source of the
Afon Lwyd
. It is within the boundaries of the historic county of
Monmouthshire
and the
preserved county
of

. The population is 6,055.
Parts of the town and surrounding country form the

History
[
edit
]
The Church in Wales church of St Peter
The Church in Wales church of St Paul
The Former
Municipal Offices
in Lion Street
Big Pit National Coal Museum
Rail manufactured in Blaenavon, seen in Sweden
Horeb
Baptist church
Blaenavon
literally means "head of the river" or loosely "river's source" in the
Welsh language
. Blaenavon grew around an
ironworks
opened in 1788 by the
West Midlands
industrialist
Thomas Hill
and his partners, Thomas Hopkins and Benjamin Pratt. The businessmen invested £40,000 into the ironworks project and erected three blast furnaces. Hopkins, as a result of operating the Cannock Wood Forge, Staffordshire, was in contact with skilled and experienced ironworkers, and managed to persuade many of them to migrate to Blaenavon to help establish the new ironworks. In 1836
Robert William Kennard
formed the Blaenavon Coal and Iron Company, which subsequently bought the Blaenavon Ironworks.
Blaenavon House, a mansion constructed in 1798 by Thomas Hopkins, was repurposed as a hospital in 1924, supported by the subscriptions of local iron and coal workers. In the 1940s the hospital site was given by the then owners of the site, the
National Coal Board
, to the UK
Ministry of Health
; it was run as a
cottage hospital
until 1985. When the hospital closed the building was sold by the local authority and refurbished as a nursing home for the elderly. In 1995 the building was listed as a Grade 2
listed building
. Following the closure of the nursing home in 2007, the building was left empty. It was badly vandalised and stripped of its lead work, slate roof and original interiors, and was placed on the Buildings At Risk register. In 2016 a fire caused severe damage to the ballroom wing and adjoining extension. The House was sold in 2017 to private owners and is currently undergoing restoration as a family home once again.
The
Municipal Offices
in Lion Street were the home of Blaenavon Urban District Council until local government reorganisation in 1974.
[3]
Governance
[
edit
]
Blaenavon is a
community
represented by Blaenavon Town Council and is an
electoral ward
of
Torfaen County Borough Council
. Blaenavon is
twinned
with
Coutras
in France.
[4]
Geography
[
edit
]
The town lies near the source of the
Afon Lwyd
river, north of
Cwmbran
.
Demography
[
edit
]
The population of Blaenavon has declined gradually at each ten-year census since the closure of the
ironworks
in 1900. It had fallen to 8,451 by 1961 and fell more rapidly after closure of the
coal mine
in 1980. Part of this decline was not emigration but a decrease in birth rate.
[5]
Economy
[
edit
]
Further information:
Blaenavon Ironworks
The Blaenavon Coal and Iron Company developed the Big Pit coalworks with adjoining steel works particularly for rail manufacture.
[6]
The steel-making and coal mining industries followed, boosting the town's population to over 20,000 at one time before 1890.
[7]
Since 1988, part of this site has been the
Big Pit National Coal Museum
.
[8]
Culture and community
[
edit
]
Government, publishers and mainly Welsh writers sought in 2003 to attract more visitors by introducing Blaenavon as Wales' second "
book town
" (the first being
Hay-on-Wye
on the English border). However, the project did not succeed.
[9]
This can be attributed to a combination of the town's remote location and the established competition from Hay. Many thriving community groups serve and improve the town, including Future Blaenavon, which has helped to create a community garden at the bottom of the town.
Landmarks
[
edit
]
Parts of the town and surrounding country form the
Blaenavon Industrial Landscape
, selected as a
World Heritage Site
by
UNESCO
in 2000. Attractions in the town include the
Big Pit National Coal Museum
(an Anchor Point of the
European Route of Industrial Heritage
),
Blaenavon Ironworks
,
[10]
the
Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway
and Blaenavon World Heritage Centre. The town has a male voice choir, a town band, and many historical walks through the local mountains.
Transport
[
edit
]
A railway viaduct was constructed in 1790; the structure disappeared and was unearthed in a 2001 episode of the archaeology television programme
Time Team
.
[11]
The
Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway
is a scenic attraction rich in geological and historical interest. Blaenavon lost both of its passenger railway stations —
Blaenavon High Level
station closed in 1941, and the last train from Blaenavon (Low Level) (to
Newport
via
Pontypool Crane Street
) ran in April 1962. The lower line had already been closed for more than a year before the
Beeching Axe
took place. The lower line's passenger service was among many in Gwent (Monmouthshire) which
Ministry of Transport
de-classified papers reveal were axed because of rail congestion in the Newport area following the newly opened
Llanwern steelworks
.

Historic homestead in Tasmania, Australia
General information
Location
Hagley
Address
1145 Westwood Road
Country
Australia
Coordinates
Quamby Estate
is a country homestead situated on 150 acres in
Tasmania
's
Meander Valley
. The estate is a Tasmanian historically important property and dates back to 1828. Quamby was the home of Sir
Richard Dry
, a
premier of Tasmania
and the first native-born premier and knight in any Australian colony.
[1]
The property is now a commercial luxury lodge.
[2]
The estate features a white
Anglo-Indian
designed main homestead referred to as Tasmania's Government House of the North, a function pavilion and a golf course.
[3]
It is situated near the historic township of
Hagley
.
[4]
History
[
edit
]
Quamby Estate was the home of
Sir Richard Dry
and during his time as premier, Quamby Homestead became known as the "Government House of the North".
[5]
Sir Richard Dry was born at Elphin Farm,
Launceston
, on 7 September 1815. His father, Richard Dry Senior had been transported to Tasmania as a political prisoner for his part in the Irish rebellion of 1804, but was granted his freedom in 1818.
When Dry (Senior) died in 1843 he left the Quamby Estate's 30,000 acres (120 km
2
) to his son. Portions of the land have been sold off over time; by 1963 the estate was reduced to 600 acres (2.4 km
2
). Quamby Estate's main house is a 33-room building in the American Colonial style, that was built over 10 years from 1828.
[6]
In adulthood Richard Jnr. married Clara Meredith. His parliamentary career began in 1845, when he was nominated to the non-elected Legislative Council by the governor, Sir
John Eardley-Wilmot
. In 1846, following a clash with the governor, Richard Dry and five other Legislative Councillors resigned their seats as a protest against what they considered the unconstitutional conduct of the governor. They were later reinstated by Queen Victoria. 
In 1858, on a two-year visit to England, Queen Victoria bestowed on him a knighthood in honour of his outstanding service to the colony of Tasmania.
Sir Richard Dry had no heirs and just prior to his death in 1868 he had begun to shed the vast acreage of Quamby Estate. Sir Richard was buried beneath the chancery in the Church he founded, St Mary's at Hagley.
[7]
Soon after Lady Dry sold Quamby and sailed for England. At the time it was one of the most important land sales ever held in Tasmania.
[8]
Recognition
[
edit
]
Quamby Estate is listed on both the now-defunct
Register of the National Estate
and the
Tasmanian Heritage Register
.
[9]
Current usage
[
edit
]
Current owners and Virgin Australia founders Brett Godfrey and Rob Sherrard purchased Quamby Estate in 2010. They have also invested in several other tourism assets including the Tasmanian Walking Company, Lake House and Low Head in Tasmania. Brett Godfrey co owns Makepeace Island in Queensland with Sir Richard Branson.
[10]
In 2011 Quamby Estate was fully restored to a lodge housing 10 guest rooms. Quamby Estate is also the base for Tasmanian Walking Companies' Bay of Fires and Cradle Mountain Huts Guided Walks
[11]
In the early 1990s, the lodge added a golf course, whose 8th hole is the longest par 5 in Tasmania at 576 metres. The Georgian Club House was built in the 1850s as original Estate Manager's office.

The Hawkeyes dominated from start to finish in this lopsided victory. The final result isn't even indicative of how much Iowa rolled over the Mean Green as Iowa called off the dogs in the second half but still continued to score.

rushed for 4 touchdowns to tie the Iowa single-game record.

Following a season opening loss to
#3 Alabama
, the Badgers entered this game ranked #19 after three straight convincing wins (outscoring those opponents 114-3). Wisconsin kicked a field goal on the game's opening possession to take an early 3-0 lead. The Hawkeyes capitalized on two second quarter miscues to take a 10-3 advantage into the locker room. Wisconsin tacked on a field goal in the 3rd quarter, making it 10-6. Midway through the 4th quarter, the Hawkeyes recovered a costly Wisconsin fumble on a 2nd and goal play from the Iowa 1-yard line. The Badgers reached the Iowa 16 on their final possession, but a 4th down pass fell incomplete with 36 seconds remaining and the Hawkeyes ran out the clock, ending a classic defensive battle.

Cornerback Desmond King collected his second two-interception game of the season and was named co-
Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week
[11]
and Jim Thorpe Defensive Player of the Week.
[12]
Wisconsin was 71-9 in 80 games at
Camp Randall Stadium
dating back to the final game of the 2003 regular season and ending with this game. Incredibly, Iowa was 4-1 in those games with Wisconsin going 70-5 against all other opponents.
After this game, Wisconsin held a
44-43-2 edge in the rivalry

Every time it looked like Iowa might pull away, Indiana came back to keep it close in this back-and-forth game. One of the most critical plays of the contest came on a
C. J. Beathard
diving touchdown with only 17 seconds remaining before halftime. The play was reviewed as it looked like he might have lost possession before crossing the goal line but it was ultimately ruled a touchdown.

Minnesota returned to Kinnick Stadium for the annual
Floyd of Rosedale
game with a lot of momentum from last year, when they routed Iowa 51-14 in the Twin Cities. Minnesota, despite losing
David Cobb
to the NFL last year and going through a mid-season coaching transition, had a lot to prove as they entered the undefeated #5 Iowa's home stadium in an attempt to deliver the upset. Mitch Leidner, who had not lived up to expectations early in the season, was coming off a good run of games, and had two weeks earlier come within a 4th-down pass at the 1 to beating a hot Michigan team.
Minnesota hung on well to the Hawkeyes but were unable to stop the Iowa halfbacks. LeShun Daniels Jr. ran for nearly 200 yards, and CJ Beathard scored on a play action bootleg in the red zone, reminiscent of Iowa great Chuck Long's game-winning bootleg against Michigan State in 1985.
Iowa kept building on its lead all night, and LeShun Daniels Jr. broke through the box to run it in 51 yards in the final 3 minutes. With Minnesota down two scores, Shannon Brooks took the offense on a high-energy no-huddle drive through the air that took less than 1 minute to score. Minnesota's onside kick failed, and Iowa took the win, 40-35.

Iowa turned the ball over twice in the first half - a fumble leading to the Spartans first points and an interception in the end zone - but led 6-3. Michigan State dominated the third quarter in time of possession and yardage, and tacked on two field goals to lead 9-6. Trailing entering the 4th quarter for the first time all season, the Hawkeyes responded in a big way with an 85-yard touchdown pass from C. J. Beathard to Tevaun Smith that gave Iowa a 13-9 lead with 14:49 remaining. After exchanging punts, Michigan State marched 82 yards in 22 plays and took 9:04 off the clock. The game-winning score came on a 1-yard touchdown run with 27 seconds left.

The Hawkeyes received a bid to the 2016 Rose Bowl after dropping in the College Football Playoff ranking to #5 in their loss to Michigan State, which came as a surprise to much of sports media who believed that Ohio State would jump the loser of the Big Ten Championship Game. Since the Rose Bowl traditionally gives a bid to the winner of the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences, and due to the new College Football Playoff system where the conference champion was likely to enter the playoff, the Rose Bowl committee had announced prior to the Big Ten Championship Game that they would give a bid to the second highest-ranked Big Ten team if a Big Ten team entered the playoff, since it was clear that the winner of the Big Ten Championship Game would finish in the Top 4 ranking.
#5 Iowa was named the home team and #6 Stanford was named the away team. Sports analysts had anticipated the contest to be exciting, due mainly to the matchup between Iowa's strong run defense and Stanford running back
Christian McCaffrey
, the
Heisman Trophy
runner-up. Iowa's run defense finished the season ranked 14th, allowing only 121 yards per game and having defeated historically rushing teams like Wisconsin, Indiana, and Nebraska.
[45]
Contrarily, Christian McCaffrey led the FBS in the 2015 season with 3,864 all-purpose yards, which came from punt/kick returns, runs from scrimmage, and passes out of the backfield.
[46]
Christian McCaffrey caught a short pass and turned it into a 75-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. The Hawkeyes were unable to stop him, as he averaged 9.6 YPC (172 yards on 18 carries), returned a punt for a touchdown, and converted many third downs. Though he did not rush for any touchdowns from scrimmage, he proved to be the primary playmaker for Stanford, catching a third (4) of Kevin Hogan's passes. McCaffrey was such an offensive threat that Hogan was able to make large gains with the read option, including a wide-open first-quarter option TD run.
Iowa was unable to get their run game going, rushing as a team for 1.3 YPC (48 yards on 38 carries). The longest Iowa runs came from LeShun Daniels, Jr. and Akrum Wadley (14 and 12 yards, respectively),
[47]
as well as a 14-yard scramble by Beathard. Iowa's inability to establish a run game closed up Iowa's potential for play-action passing, which has been Beathard's bread and butter all season. Jordan Canzeri, Iowa's power halfback, was unable to churn significant yardage, and 3rd-team halfback Akrum Wadley (who had a 200-yard game at Northwestern, when Daniels and Canzeri were both injured) split ballcarrying duties with Daniels in the second half. Iowa's halfbacks, their biggest threat all season, were overall unable to garner any significant yardage on the ground; Derek Mitchell, Jr., Iowa's 4th-team halfback, saw significant action lining up in the backfield and caught 4 passes for 41 yards, and Wadley also contributed to the pass game by catching 3 for 60.
[47]
Stanford shut Iowa out in the first half 35-0, with Stanford's 35 points the most scored in the first half of a Rose Bowl in its entire 102-year history.
[48]
Stanford's 21-0 first-quarter lead was also the most first-quarter points scored by one team in Rose Bowl history.
[48]
Christian McCaffrey gained a total of 368 all-purpose yards, setting another Rose Bowl record.
[48]
By the second half, Stanford's explosiveness slowed down, scoring just 10 second-half points versus their 35 first-half points. Iowa did not score until the 3rd quarter when placekicker Marshall Koehn kicked a field goal after converting on 4th down earlier in the drive; Beathard threw 2 touchdowns in the 4th quarter, with Koehn missing one of the two PATs.
Iowa had a slight advantage in time of possession, possessing the ball for almost 33 minutes, though they were simply unable to make meaning out of their possessions. Iowa also outgained Stanford through the air by a slim margin, with 239 yards to Stanford's 223.
[49]
Iowa remained a symbol of old-school Big Ten power football, with most of their completed passes thrown to tight ends and halfbacks. Matt Vandeberg caught a touchdown pass, but star wideout Tevaun Smith only recorded 2 short receptions.

Edgar Franklin Foreman Jr.
(December 22, 1933 - February 2, 2022) was an American businessman and politician who was a member of the
United States House of Representatives
. He had one term representing
Texas's 16th congressional district
from 1963 to 1965 and a second term from 1969 to 1971 representing
New Mexico's 2nd district
, then newly established.
[1]
He is the most historically recent member of Congress to have
represented more than one state
during their career.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Foreman was born near
Portales, New Mexico
, in
Roosevelt County
in southeastern
New Mexico
, to Edgar Foreman Sr. and the former Lillian Childress.
[2]
From 1952 to 1953, he attended
Eastern New Mexico College
in Portales. He transferred to
New Mexico State University
in
Las Cruces
, where in 1955 he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in
civil engineering
.
From 1953 to 1956, Foreman was employed by
Phillips Petroleum Company
. From 1956 to 1957, he served in the
United States Navy
as an enlisted sailor.
[3]
He also served in the
United States Navy Reserve
and
United States Air Force Reserve
. While in the Air Force Reserve, he became a captain in the
9999th Air Reserve Squadron
in Washington, DC while serving as a congressman.
[3]
He headed Foreman Brine Sales and Service in
Odessa, Texas
, from 1956 to 1962. He was formerly the president of Valley Transit Mix, Atlas Land Company, and Foreman Oil, Inc.
[2]
Political career
[
edit
]
Represented West Texas, 1963-1965
[
edit
]
In 1962 Foreman was elected to Congress from the 16th District in
West Texas
,
[2]
which stretched from
El Paso
to the
Permian Basin
. His victory is attributed to the incumbent
Democratic
Representative
J. T. Rutherford
having been linked with the
Billie Sol Estes
scandal.
[

]
In that same election, the Democrat, later Republican,
John B. Connally, Jr.
, was elected
governor
over the Republican oilfield equipment executive Jack Cox.
Foreman was defeated when he sought re-election in 1964, a year in which President
Lyndon B. Johnson
, a Texan, was reelected over Republican
U.S. Senator
Barry M. Goldwater
in a landslide, and the Republicans suffered massive losses throughout the nation.
Represented southern New Mexico, 1969-1971
[
edit
]
Following his defeat, he relocated to New Mexico, where he became active in business and civic affairs in
Las Cruces
.
[4]
In 1968 while residing in Las Cruces, Foreman ran for Congress in the southern district of
New Mexico
[2]
and upset the two-term Democrat
E. S. "Johnny" Walker
of
Albuquerque
.
Richard Nixon
won New Mexico's electoral votes that year over
Hubert H. Humphrey
, and that Republican momentum helped Foreman to get elected.
[

]
Foreman was unseated after a single term in 1970 by Democrat
Harold Runnels
.
Appointment to two federal jobs
[
edit
]
After losing a House seat for the second time in six years, Foreman in 1971 was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior in the Nixon administration, and the following year, 1972, he was appointed to a position at the
United States Department of Transportation
, where he stayed until 1976.
[4]
Personal life and death
[
edit
]
Foreman died on February 2, 2022, at the age of 88.

The
Soviet Union
,
[r]
officially the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
[s]
(
USSR
),
[t]
was a
transcontinental country
that spanned much of
Eurasia
from 1922 to 1991. A flagship
communist state
, it was nominally a
federal union
of
fifteen national republics
;
[u]
in practice, both
its government
and
its economy
were highly
centralized
until its final years. It was a
one-party state
governed by the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
, with the city of
Moscow
serving as its capital as well as that of its largest and most populous republic: the
Russian SFSR
. Other major cities included
Leningrad
(Russian SFSR),
Kiev
(
Ukrainian SSR
),
Minsk
(
Byelorussian SSR
),
Tashkent
(
Uzbek SSR
),
Alma-Ata
(
Kazakh SSR
), and
Novosibirsk
(Russian SFSR). It was the largest country in the world, covering over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi) and spanning
eleven time zones
.
The country's roots lay in the
October Revolution
of 1917, which saw the
Bolsheviks
overthrow the
Russian Provisional Government
that formed earlier that year following the
February Revolution
and the abdication of
Tsar Nicholas II
, marking
the end
of the
Russian Empire
. The new government, led by
Vladimir Lenin
, established the
Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic
(RSFSR), the world's first constitutionally guaranteed
socialist state
.
[v]
Persisting internal tensions escalated into the brutal
Russian Civil War
. As the war progressed in the Bolsheviks' favor, the RSFSR began to incorporate land conquered from the war into nominally independent states, which were unified into the Soviet Union in December 1922. Following
Lenin's death
in 1924,
Joseph Stalin
came to power. Stalin inaugurated a period of
rapid industrialization
and
forced collectivization
that led to significant economic growth, but also contributed to a
famine in 1930-1933
that killed millions. The
forced labour camp
system of the
Gulag
was also expanded in this period. Stalin conducted the
Great Purge
to remove his actual and perceived opponents. After the outbreak of
World War II
, Germany
invaded the Soviet Union
. The combined
Soviet civilian and military casualty count
—estimated to be around 20 million people—accounted for the majority of losses of
Allied forces
. In the
aftermath of World War II
, the territory occupied by the Red Army formed various
Soviet satellite states
.
The beginning of the
Cold War
saw the
Eastern Bloc
of the Soviet Union confront the
Western Bloc
of the
United States
, with the latter grouping becoming largely united in 1949 under
NATO
and the former grouping becoming largely united in 1955 under the
Warsaw Pact
. There was no direct military confrontation between the two organizations; instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and through
proxy wars
. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs. The Warsaw Pact's largest military engagement was the
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
, its own member state, in August 1968 (with the participation of all pact nations except
Albania
and
Romania
), which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than one month later. Following
Stalin's death
in 1953, a period known as
de-Stalinization
occurred under the leadership of
Nikita Khrushchev
. The Soviets took an early lead in the
Space Race
with the
first artificial satellite
, the
first human spaceflight
, and the
first probe to land on another planet
(
Venus
).
In the 1970s, there was a brief
détente
in the
Soviet Union's relationship with the United States
, but tensions emerged again following the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader,
Mikhail Gorbachev
, sought to reform the country through his policies of
glasnost
and
perestroika
. In 1989, during the closing stages of the Cold War, various countries of the Warsaw Pact
overthrew their Marxist-Leninist regimes
, which was accompanied by the outbreak of strong
nationalist
and
separatist
movements across the entire Soviet Union. In 1991, Gorbachev initiated
a national referendum
—boycotted by the Soviet republics of
Lithuania
,
Latvia
,
Estonia
,
Armenia
,
Georgia
, and
Moldova
—that resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favour of
preserving the country as a renewed federation
. In August 1991, hardline members of the Communist Party staged
a coup d'état against Gorbachev
; the attempt failed, with
Boris Yeltsin
playing a high-profile role in facing down the unrest, and the Communist Party was subsequently banned. The
Russian Federation
became the Soviet Union's successor state, while all of the other republics emerged from the
USSR's collapse
as fully independent
post-Soviet states
.
The Soviet Union produced many significant
social and technological achievements and innovations
. It had the world's
second-largest economy
, and the
Soviet Armed Forces
comprised the largest standing military in the world. An
NPT-designated state
, it possessed the
largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world
. It was a
founding member
of the
United Nations
as well as one of the
five permanent members
of the
United Nations Security Council
. Before the dissolution, the country had maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military and economic strengths and
scientific research
.

vět-iti
('to inform'), related to Slavic
věst
('news'), English
wise
, the root in
ad-vis-or
(which came to English through French), or the Dutch
weten
('to know'; compare
wetenschap
meaning 'science'). The word
sovietnik
means 'councillor'.
[9]
Some organizations in Russian history were called
council
(Russian:
совет
). In the
Russian Empire
, the
State Council
, which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers.
[9]
The Soviets as
workers' councils
first appeared during the
Russian Revolution of 1905
.
[10]
[11]
Although they were quickly suppressed by the Imperial army, after the
February Revolution of 1917
, workers' and soldiers' Soviets emerged throughout the country, and shared power with the
Russian Provisional Government
.
[10]
[12]
The Bolsheviks, led by
Vladimir Lenin
, demanded that all power be transferred to the Soviets, and gained support from the workers and soldiers.
[13]
After the
October Revolution
, in which the Bolsheviks seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of the Soviets,
[12]
[14]
Lenin proclaimed the formation of the
Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic
(RSFSR).
[15]
During the
Georgian Affair
of 1922, Lenin called for the Russian SFSR and other national Soviet republics to form a greater union which he initially named as the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia (Russian:
Союз Советских Республик Европы и Азии
,
tr.
Sojuz Sovjetskih Respublik Evropy i Azii
).
[16]
Joseph Stalin
initially resisted Lenin's proposal but ultimately accepted it, and with Lenin's agreement he changed the name to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), although all republics began as
socialist soviet
and did not change to the other order until
1936
. In addition, in the regional languages of several republics, the word
council
or
conciliar
in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian
soviet
and never in others, e.g.
Ukrainian SSR
.
СССР
(in the Latin alphabet:
SSSR
) is the abbreviation of the Russian language cognate of USSR, as written in
Cyrillic letters
. The Soviets used this abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning. After this, the most common Russian initialization is
Союз ССР
(transliteration:
Soyuz SSR
) which, after compensating for grammatical differences, essentially translates to
Union of SSRs
in English. In addition, the Russian short form name
Советский Союз
(transliteration:
Sovjetskij Sojuz
, which literally means
Soviet Union
) is also commonly used, but only in its unabbreviated form. Since the start of the
Great Patriotic War
at the latest, abbreviating the Russian name of the Soviet Union as
СС
(in the same way as, for example,
United States
is abbreviated into
US
) has been a complete taboo, the reason being that
СС
as a Russian Cyrillic abbreviation is instead associated with the infamous
Schutzstaffel
of
Nazi Germany
, just as
SS
is in English. One apparent exception was the Russian abbreviation the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
,
КПСС
(
KPSS
).
In English language media, the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR. In other European languages, the locally translated short forms and abbreviations are usually used such as
Union soviétique
and
URSS
in French, or
Sowjetunion
and
UdSSR
in German. The Russian SFSR dominated the Soviet Union to such an extent that for most of the Soviet Union's existence, it was commonly, but incorrectly, referred to as Russia. Technically, Russia itself was only one republic within the larger union—albeit by far the largest, most powerful and most highly developed of the 15 republics. Nevertheless, according to historian Matthew White, it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was "window dressing" for Russian dominance. For that reason, the people of the USSR were almost always called "Russians", not "Soviets", since "everyone knew who really ran the show".

Lenin

and
Kamenev
celebrating the second anniversary of the
October Revolution
Modern revolutionary activity in the
Russian Empire
began with the 1825
Decembrist revolt
. Although
serfdom
was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavourable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries. A parliament—the
State Duma
—was established in 1906 after the
Russian Revolution of 1905
, but
Emperor Nicholas II
resisted attempts to move from
absolute
to a
constitutional monarchy
.
Social unrest
continued and was aggravated during
World War I
by military defeat and food shortages in major cities.
A spontaneous popular demonstration in Petrograd on
8 March
1917, demanding peace and bread, culminated in the
February Revolution
and the abdication of Nicholas II and the imperial government.
[18]
The
tsarist autocracy
was replaced by the
social-democratic
Russian Provisional Government
, which intended to conduct elections to the
Russian Constituent Assembly
and to continue fighting on the side of the
Entente
in
World War I
. At the same time,
workers' councils
, known in Russian as '
Soviets
', sprang up across the country, and the most influential of them, the
Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies
, shared power with the Provisional Government.
[11]
[12]
The
Bolsheviks
, led by
Vladimir Lenin
, pushed for
communist revolution
in the Soviets and on the streets, adopting the slogan of "All Power to the Soviets" and urging the overthrow of the Provisional Government.
[19]
[20]
On 7 November 1917, Bolshevik
Red Guards
stormed the
Winter Palace
in Petrograd, arresting the Provisional Government leaders and Lenin declared that all power was now transferred to the Soviets.
[14]
[12]
This event would later be officially known in Soviet bibliographies as the "
Great October Socialist Revolution
". The bloody
Red Terror
was initiated to shut down all opposition, both perceived and real.
[21]
In December, the Bolsheviks signed an
armistice
with the
Central Powers
, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed. In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war and signed the
separate peace
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
.
A long and bloody
Civil War
ensued between the
Reds
and the
Whites
, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory. It included
foreign intervention
, the
murder of the former Emperor and his family
, and the
famine of 1921-1922
, which killed about five million people.
[22]
In March 1921, during
a related war against Poland
, the
Peace of Riga
was signed, splitting disputed territories in
Belarus
and
Ukraine
between the
Republic of Poland
and
Soviet Russia
. Soviet Russia sought to re-conquer all newly
independent nations
of the former Empire, although their success was limited.
Estonia
,
Finland
,
Latvia
, and
Lithuania
all repelled Soviet invasions, while
Ukraine
, Belarus (as a result of the
Polish-Soviet War
),
Armenia
,
Azerbaijan
and
Georgia
were occupied by the Red Army.
[23]
[24]
Additionally, forced requisition of food by the Soviet government led to substantial resistance, of which the most notable was the
Tambov Rebellion
, ultimately put down by the Red Army.
[25]
Dissolution of the elected
Russian Constituent Assembly
by the Bolsheviks on 6 January 1918
Russian Civil War
in the European part of Russia
The Civil War had a devastating impact on the economy. A
black market
emerged in Russia, despite the threat of
martial law
against profiteering. The
ruble
collapsed, with
barter
increasingly replacing money as a medium of exchange
[26]
and, by 1921, heavy industry output had fallen to 20% of 1913 levels. 90% of wages were paid with goods rather than money.
[27]
70% of locomotives were in need of repair
[

]
, and food requisitioning, combined with the effects of seven years of war and a severe drought, contributed to a famine that caused between 3 and 10 million deaths.
[28]
Coal production decreased from 27.5 million tons (1913) to 7 million tons (1920), while overall factory production also declined from 10,000 million roubles to 1,000 million roubles. According to the noted historian David Christian, the grain harvest was also slashed from 80.1 million tons (1913) to 46.5 million tons (1920).
[29]
Treaty on the Creation of the USSR
On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the
Russian SFSR
, the
Transcaucasian SFSR
, the
Ukrainian SSR
and the
Byelorussian SSR
approved the
Treaty on the Creation of the USSR
[30]
and the
Declaration of the Creation of the USSR
, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
[31]
These two documents were confirmed by the first
Congress of Soviets of the USSR
and signed by the heads of the delegations,
[32]
Mikhail Kalinin
,
Mikhail Tskhakaya
,
Mikhail Frunze
,
Grigory Petrovsky
and
Alexander Chervyakov
,
[33]
on 30 December 1922. The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the
Bolshoi Theatre
in Moscow.
An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917. A large part of this was done according to the
Bolshevik Initial Decrees
, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin. One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the
GOELRO plan
, which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total
electrification
of Russia.
[34]
The plan became the prototype for subsequent
Five-Year Plans
and was fulfilled by 1931.
[35]
After the economic policy of '
War communism
' during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing
socialism
in the country, the Soviet government
permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry
in the 1920s, and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax.
The
Russian famine of 1921-22
killed an estimated 5 million people.
[36]
[37]
From its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the
one-party rule
of the
Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
.
[x]
The stated purpose was to prevent the return of capitalist exploitation, and that the principles of
democratic centralism
would be the most effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner. The debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924. Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a '
troika
' consisting of
Grigory Zinoviev
of the
Ukrainian SSR
,
Lev Kamenev
of the
Russian SFSR
, and
Joseph Stalin
of the
Transcaucasian SFSR
.
On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the United Kingdom.
[

]
The same year, a
Soviet Constitution
was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union.
According to
Archie Brown
the constitution was never an accurate guide to political reality in the USSR. For example, the fact that the Party played the leading role in making and enforcing policy was not mentioned in it until 1977.
[38]
The USSR was a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities. However, the term 'Soviet Russia' - formally applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic - was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers due to its domination by the Russian SFSR.

The
Soviet famine of 1930-1933
, with areas where the effects of famine were most severe shaded
On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the
General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
. Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the
Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate
, which gave Stalin considerable power.
[39]
By
gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party
, Stalin became the
undisputed leader
of the country and, by the end of the 1920s, established a
totalitarian
rule. In October 1927, Zinoviev and
Leon Trotsky
were expelled from the
Central Committee
and forced into exile.
In 1928, Stalin introduced the
first five-year plan
for building a
socialist economy
. In place of the
internationalism
expressed by Lenin throughout the revolution, it aimed to build
Socialism in One Country
. In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of
industrialization
. In
agriculture
, rather than adhering to the 'lead by example' policy advocated by Lenin,
[40]
forced
collectivization of farms
was implemented all over the country.
Famines
ensued as a result, causing deaths estimated at three to seven million; surviving
kulaks
(wealthy or middle-class peasants) were persecuted, and many were sent to
Gulags
to do
forced labor
.
[41]
[42]
Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s. Despite the turmoil of the mid-to-late 1930s, the country developed a robust industrial economy in the years preceding
World War II
.

Closer cooperation between the USSR and the West developed in the early 1930s. From 1932 to 1934, the country participated in the
World Disarmament Conference
. In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, chose to recognize Stalin's Communist government formally and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two countries.
[43]
In September 1934, the country joined the
League of Nations
. After the
Spanish Civil War
broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the
Republican forces
against the
Nationalists
, who were supported by
Fascist Italy
and
Nazi Germany
.
[44]
In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new
constitution
that was praised by supporters around the world as the most democratic constitution imaginable, though there was some skepticism. American historian J. Arch Getty concludes: "Many who lauded Stalin's Soviet Union as the most democratic country on earth lived to regret their words. After all, the Soviet Constitution of 1936 was adopted on the eve of the Great Terror of the late 1930s; the "thoroughly democratic" elections to the first Supreme Soviet permitted only uncontested candidates and took place at the height of the savage violence in 1937. The civil rights, personal freedoms, and democratic forms promised in the Stalin constitution were trampled almost immediately and remained dead letters until long after Stalin's death."

Stalin's
Great Purge
resulted in the detainment or execution of many '

' who had participated in the October Revolution. According to declassified Soviet archives, the
NKVD
arrested more than one and a half million people in 1937 and 1938, of whom 681,692 were shot.
[46]
Over those two years, there were an average of over one thousand executions a day.

In 1939, after attempts to form a military alliance with Britain and France against Germany failed, the Soviet Union made a dramatic shift towards Nazi Germany.
[51]
Almost a year after Britain and France had concluded the
Munich Agreement
with Germany, the Soviet Union made agreements with Germany as well, both militarily and economically during
extensive talks
. Unlike the case of Britain and France, the Soviet Union's agreement with Germany, the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
(signed on 23 August 1939), included a secret protocol that paved the way for the Soviet invasion of Eastern European states and
occupation of their territories
.

On 1 September, Germany
invaded Poland
and on the 17th the Soviet Union invaded Poland as well. On 6 October, Poland fell and part of the Soviet occupation zone was then handed over to Germany.
On 10 October, the Soviet Union and Lithuania signed an agreement whereby the Soviet Union transferred Polish sovereignty over the Vilna region to Lithuania, and on 28 October the boundary between the Soviet occupation zone and the new territory of Lithuania was officially demarcated.
On 1 November, the Soviet Union
annexed Western Ukraine
, followed by Western Belarus on the 2nd.
In late November, unable to coerce the
Republic of Finland
by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from
Leningrad
, Stalin ordered the
invasion of Finland
. On 14 December 1939, the Soviet Union was expelled from the
League of Nations
for invading Finland.
[53]
In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during
border clashes
with the
Empire of Japan
in 1938 and 1939. However, in April 1941, the USSR signed the
Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact
with Japan, which the Soviets would unilaterally break in 1945, recognizing the territorial integrity of
Manchukuo
, a Japanese
puppet state
. The pact ensured Japan would not enter the war against the USSR on the side of Germany later.

, considered by many historians as a decisive turning point of World War II
Germany broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and
invaded the Soviet Union
on 22 June 1941 starting what is known in Russia and some other post-Soviet states as the
Great Patriotic War
. The
Red Army
stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the
Battle of Moscow
. The
Battle of Stalingrad
, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to Germany from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war. After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before
Germany surrendered in 1945
. The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.
[54]
Harry Hopkins
, a close foreign policy advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt, spoke on 10 August 1943 of the USSR's decisive role in the war, saying that "While in Sicily the forces of Great Britain and the United States are being opposed by 2 German divisions, the Russian front is receiving attention of approximately 200 German divisions."

[57]
This includes 8.7 million military deaths. The majority of the losses were ethnic

During the war, the country together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the
Big Four
Allied powers,
[62]
and later became the
Four Policemen
that formed the basis of the
United Nations Security Council
.
[63]
It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period. Once denied
diplomatic recognition
by the Western world, the USSR had official relations with practically every country by the late 1940s. A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the country
became
one of the
five permanent members
of the
United Nations Security Council
, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions.
The USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the
Yalta Conference
, broke the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 which Japan had been honoring despite their alliance with Germany,
[64]
and
invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories
on 9 August 1945.
[65]
This conflict
ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional
surrender of Japan
and the end of World War II.
Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in
Germany
.
[66]
The
wartime rapes
were followed by decades of silence.
[67]
[68]
[69]
According to historian
Antony Beevor
, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges,
NKVD
(Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it.
[70]
It was often
rear echelon
units who committed the rapes. According to professor Oleg Rzheshevsky, "4,148 Red Army officers and many privates were punished for committing atrocities".
[71]
The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million.

U.S.

shipments to the USSR. During the war the USSR provided an unknown number of shipments of rare minerals to the US Treasury as a form of cashless
repayment of Lend-Lease
.
The Soviet Union was greatly assisted in its wartime effort by the United States via
Lend Lease
. In total, the U.S. deliveries to the USSR through Lend-Lease amounted to $11
billion
in materials: over 400,000
jeeps
and trucks; 12,000
armored vehicles
(including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386
[73]
of which were
M3 Lees
and 4,102
M4 Shermans
);
[74]
11,400 aircraft (of which 4,719 were
Bell P-39 Airacobras
, 3,414 were
Douglas A-20 Havocs
and 2,397 were
Bell P-63 Kingcobras
)
[75]
and 1.75 million tons of food.
[76]
As Soviet soldiers were bearing the brunt of the war, Roosevelt's advisor
Harry Hopkins
felt that American aid to the Soviets would hasten the war's conclusion.
[77]
Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.

Cold War

Sino-Soviet split
of 1961 (total area: c. 35,000,000 km

)
[aa]
During the immediate post-war period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its
strictly centralized control
. It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe (except
Yugoslavia
and later
Albania
), turning them into
satellite states
. The USSR bound its satellite states in a military alliance, the
Warsaw Pact
, in 1955, and an economic organization, Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or
Comecon
, a counterpart to the
European Economic Community
(EEC), from 1949 to 1991.
[80]
Although nominally a "defensive" alliance, the Warsaw Pact's primary function was to safeguard the
Soviet Union's hegemony
over its
Eastern European
satellites, with the Pact's only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away.
[81]
The USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany's industrial plants, and it exacted
war reparations
from
East Germany
,
Hungary
,
Romania
, and
Bulgaria
using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favour the country. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes: "The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the
Marshall Plan
."
[82]
Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious
Chinese Communist Party
, and its influence grew elsewhere in the world. Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies. In the ensuing
Cold War
, the two sides clashed indirectly in
proxy wars
.
De-Stalinization and Khrushchev Thaw (1953-1964)
Main article:
History of the Soviet Union (1953-1964)
Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev
(left) with US President
John F. Kennedy
in Vienna, 3 June 1961
Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by
Georgy Malenkov
. This did not last, however, and
Nikita Khrushchev
eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s. In 1956, he
denounced Joseph Stalin
and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society. This was known as
de-Stalinization
.
Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941. For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership. As a result, Soviet military forces were used to suppress an anti-communist uprising in
Hungary
in 1956.
In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West, and what
Mao Zedong
perceived as Khrushchev's
revisionism
, led to the
Sino-Soviet split
. This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist-Leninist movement, with the governments in
Albania
,
Cambodia
and
Somalia
choosing to ally with China.
Republics of the Soviet Union
in 1954-1991
During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the USSR continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the
Space Race
, rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite,
Sputnik 1
in 1957; a living dog named
Laika
in 1957; the first human being,
Yuri Gagarin
in 1961; the first woman in space,
Valentina Tereshkova
in 1963;
Alexei Leonov
, the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the Moon by spacecraft
Luna 9
in 1966; and the first Moon rovers,
Lunokhod 1
and
Lunokhod 2
.
[83]
Khrushchev initiated '
The Thaw
', a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the country. This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a
crisis with the United States
over the Soviet deployment of
nuclear missiles
in
Cuba
. An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and
Turkey
, concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.

Soviet general secretary
Leonid Brezhnev
and US President
Jimmy Carter
sign the
SALT II arms limitation treaty
in Vienna on 18 June 1979.
Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of
collective leadership
ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary,
Alexei Kosygin
as Premier and
Nikolai Podgorny
as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.
In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies
invaded
Czechoslovakia
to crush the
Prague Spring
reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion and previous military interventions, as well as any potential military interventions in the future, by introducing the
Brezhnev Doctrine
, which proclaimed any threat to Soviet rule in a Warsaw Pact state as a threat to all Warsaw Pact states, therefore justifying military intervention.
Brezhnev presided throughout
détente
with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (
SALT I
,
SALT II
,
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.
In October 1977, the
third Soviet Constitution
was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of 'standstill', with an ageing and ossified top political leadership. This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors
Yuri Andropov
and
Konstantin Chernenko
.
In late 1979, the Soviet Union's
military intervened
in the ongoing
civil war in neighboring Afghanistan
, effectively ending a détente with the West.

Mikhail Gorbachev
in one-to-one discussions with US President
Ronald Reagan
Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in
Beyond Oil
that the
Reagan administration
encouraged
Saudi Arabia
to
lower the price of oil
to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the country's
hard currency
reserves.
[84]
The
Pan-European Picnic
took place in August 1989 on the Hungarian-Austrian border.
Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long.
Yuri Andropov
was 68 years old and
Konstantin Chernenko
72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected
Mikhail Gorbachev
. In addition to the failing economy, the prolonged war in Afghanistan led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. Also, the
Chernobyl disaster
in 1986 added motive force to Gorbachev's reforms.
[85]
He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called
perestroika
. His policy of
glasnost
freed public
access to information
after decades of heavy government censorship. Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the USSR abandoned its
war in Afghanistan
and began to withdraw its forces. In the following year,
Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states
, which paved the way for the
Revolutions of 1989
. In particular, the standstill of the Soviet Union at the
Pan-European Picnic
in August 1989 then set a peaceful chain reaction in motion, at the end of which the Eastern Bloc collapsed. With the tearing down of the
Berlin Wall
and with East and West Germany pursuing re-unification, the
Iron Curtain
between
the West
and Soviet-occupied regions came down.
[86]
[87]
[88]
[89]
At the same time, the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring
sovereignty
over their territories, citing the freedom to secede in Article 72 of the USSR constitution.
[90]
On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.
[91]
Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the '
War of Laws
'. In 1989, the
Russian SFSR
convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies.
Boris Yeltsin
was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress
declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory
and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws. After a landslide victory of
Sąjūdis
in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990, citing the illegality of the
Soviet occupation of the Baltic states
. Soviet forces attempted to halt the secession by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania (
Bloody Sunday
) and Latvia (
The Barricades
), as a result of which numerous civilians were killed or wounded. However, these actions only bolstered international support for the secessionists.
[92]

August Coup
A
referendum for the preservation of the USSR
was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union in the form of a new federation. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the
New Union Treaty
, which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the
August Coup
—an attempted coup d'état by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Russian president Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party's activities were indefinitely suspended—effectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected
President of Russia
in July 1991.

Country emblems of the Soviet Republics before and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (the
Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic
(fifth in the second row) no longer exists as a political entity of any kind and the emblem is unofficial.)
The remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. However, by December all except Russia and
Kazakhstan
had formally declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the
Moscow Kremlin
. The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second-most powerful republic,
voted overwhelmingly for independence
. Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale.
On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus
(formerly Byelorussia), signed the
Belavezha Accords
, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the
Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except
Georgia
signed the
Alma-Ata Protocol
, which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin. That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the
Russian tricolour
was raised in its place.
The following day, the
Supreme Soviet
, the highest governmental body, voted both itself and the country out of existence. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final
dissolution of the Soviet Union
as a functioning state, and the end of the
Cold War
.
[93]
The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states. The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.
Following the dissolution, Russia was internationally recognized
[94]
as the USSR's
legal successor
on the international stage. To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own. Under the 1992
Lisbon Protocol
, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics. Since then, the Russian Federation has
assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations
, and is widely viewed as the USSR's successor state.
[95]
Ukraine
has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law
On Legal Succession of Ukraine
. Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR.
In summing up the international ramifications of these events,
Vladislav Zubok
stated: 'The collapse of the
Soviet empire
was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance.'
[96]
Before the dissolution, the country had maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades after World War II through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry.
[97]
Post-Soviet states
Main article:
Post-Soviet states
On 21 December 1991, the leaders of 11 former Soviet republics, including Russia and Ukraine, agreed to the
Alma-Ata Protocols
, formally establishing the
Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
The analysis of the
succession of states
for the 15
post-Soviet states
is complex.
[98]
The Russian Federation is widely seen as the legal
continuator
state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, inheriting the full
Soviet nuclear arsenal
, and also inherited the
Soviet Union's UN membership
, with its permanent seat on the
Security Council
.
[95]
Of the two other co-founding states of the USSR at the time of the dissolution,
Ukraine
was the only one that had passed laws, similar to Russia, claiming it is a state-successor of both the
Ukrainian SSR
and the USSR.
[99]
Soviet treaties laid groundwork for Ukraine's future foreign agreements as well as leading to the country agreeing to undertake 16.37% of debts of the Soviet Union for which it was going to receive its share of the USSR's foreign property. Russia's position as the 'only continuation of the USSR' that became widely accepted in the West, as well as constant pressure from the Western countries, allowed Russia to inherit Soviet state property abroad and conceal information about it. Due to that Ukraine never ratified 'zero option' agreement that Russian Federation had signed with other former Soviet republics, as it denied disclosing of information about Soviet Gold Reserves and its Diamond Fund.
[100]
[101]
The dispute over former Soviet property and assets between the two former republics is still ongoing:
The conflict is unsolvable. We can continue to poke Kiev handouts in the calculation of 'solve the problem', only it won't be solved. Going to a trial is also pointless: for a number of European countries this is a political issue, and they will make a decision clearly in whose favor. What to do in this situation is an open question. Search for non-trivial solutions. But we must remember that in 2014, with the filing of the then Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, litigation with Russia resumed in 32 countries.

Sergei Markov
[102]
Similar situation occurred with restitution of cultural property. Although on 14 February 1992 Russia and other former Soviet republics signed agreement 'On the return of cultural and historic property to the origin states' in
Minsk
, it was halted by the Russian State Duma that eventually passed '
Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation
' which made restitution currently impossible, effectively barring the return of looted cultural heritage by Soviet troops during the Second World War to its original owners.
[103]
Russian
GDP
since the end of the Soviet Union (from 2014 are forecasts)
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania consider themselves as
revivals of the three independent countries
that existed prior to their
occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union
in 1940. They maintain that the process by which they were incorporated into the Soviet Union violated both international law and their own law, and that in 1990-1991 they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.
Nearly all of the post-Soviet states suffered deep and prolonged
recessions
after
shock therapy
,
[104]
with poverty increasing more than tenfold.
[105]
In a 2001 study by the economist
Steven Rosefielde
, he calculated that there were 3.4 million premature deaths in Russia from 1990 to 1998, which he partly blames on the "shock therapy" that came with the
Washington Consensus
.
[106]
In 2011,
The Guardian
published an analysis of the former Soviet countries twenty years after the fall of the USSR. They found that "GDP fell as much as 50 percent in the 1990s in some republics... as capital flight, industrial collapse, hyperinflation and tax avoidance took their toll," but that there was a rebound in the 2000s, and by 2010 "some economies were five times as big as they were in 1991." Life expectancy has grown since 1991 in some of the countries, but fallen in others; likewise, some held free and fair elections, while others remained authoritarian.
[107]
There are additionally six states that claim independence from the other internationally recognized post-Soviet states but
possess limited international recognition
:
Abkhazia
,
Artsakh
,
Donetsk
,
Luhansk
,
South Ossetia
and
Transnistria
. The
Chechen
separatist movement of the
Chechen Republic of Ichkeria
, the
Gagauz
separatist movement of the
Gagauz Republic
and the
Talysh
separatist movement of the
Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic
are other such cases which have already been resolved.
Geography

Geography of the Soviet Union

Geography of Russia
With an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), the Soviet Union was the world's largest country, a status that is retained by the
Russian Federation
.
[108]
Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of
North America
.
[109]
Two other successor states,
Kazakhstan
and
Ukraine
, rank among the top 10 countries by land area, and the largest country entirely in Europe, respectively. The
European
portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area and was the cultural and economic center. The eastern part in
Asia
extended to the
Pacific Ocean
to the east and
Afghanistan
to the south, and, except some areas in
Central Asia
, was much less populous. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across 11
time zones
, and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south. It had five climate zones:
tundra
,
taiga
,
steppes
,
desert
and
mountains
.
The USSR, like
Russia
, had the world's longest
border
, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or
1
+
1
⁄
2
circumferences of Earth. Two-thirds of it was a
coastline
. The country bordered
Afghanistan
, the
People's Republic of China
,
Czechoslovakia
,
Finland
,
Hungary
,
Iran
,
Mongolia
,
North Korea
,
Norway
,
Poland
,
Romania
, and
Turkey
from 1945 to 1991. The
Bering Strait
separated the USSR from the
United States
.
The country's highest mountain was Communism Peak (now
Ismoil Somoni Peak
) in
Tajikistan
, at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft). The USSR also included most of the world's largest lakes; the
Caspian Sea
(shared with
Iran
), and
Lake Baikal
, the world's largest (by volume) and deepest freshwater lake that is also an internal body of water in Russia.

There were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union: the legislature represented by the
Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union
, the government represented by the
Council of Ministers
, and the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
(CPSU), the only legal party and the final policymaker in the country.
[110]
Communist Party
Main article:
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
Military parade on the
Red Square
in Moscow, 7 November 1964
At the top of the Communist Party was the
Central Committee
, elected at
Party Congresses
and Conferences. In turn, the Central Committee voted for a
Politburo
(called the Presidium between 1952 and 1966),
Secretariat
and the
general secretary
(First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the
de facto
highest office in the Soviet Union.
[111]
Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country
[112]
(except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941).
[113]
They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was
democratic centralism
, demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.
[114]
The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state mainly through its control over the
system of appointments
. All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin (1941-1953) and Khrushchev (1958-1964) were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership,
[115]
but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of
Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
, the nominal
head of state
. The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by
primary party organizations
.
[116]
However, in practice the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party,
[117]
nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although
factions were officially banned
.
[118]
Government
Main article:
Government of the Soviet Union
The
Grand Kremlin Palace
, the seat of the
Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union
, 1982
The
Supreme Soviet
(successor of the
Congress of Soviets
) was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history,
[119]
at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party. However, its powers and functions were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees. It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the
Five-Year Plans
and the
government budget
.
[120]
The Supreme Soviet elected a
Presidium
(successor of the
Central Executive Committee
) to wield its power between plenary sessions,
[121]
ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the
Supreme Court
,
[122]
the
Procurator General
[123]
and the
Council of Ministers
(known before 1946 as the
Council of People's Commissars
), headed by the
Chairman
(Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society.
[121]
State and party structures of the
constituent republics
largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990. Local authorities were organized likewise into
party committees
,
local Soviets
and
executive committees
. While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary.
[124]
The state security police (the
KGB
and
its predecessor agencies
) played an important role in Soviet politics. It was instrumental in the
Red Terror
and
Great Purge
,
[125]
but was brought under strict party control after Stalin's death. Under
Yuri Andropov
, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure,
[126]
culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The
constitution
, which was promulgated in
1924
,

and

,
[128]
did not limit state power. No formal
separation of powers
existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers
[129]
that represented executive and
legislative
branches of the government. The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed. Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin
[130]
and Stalin,
[131]
as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal,
[132]
itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee.
[133]
All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except
Georgy Malenkov
[134]
and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party.
[133]
Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition,
Mikhail Gorbachev
enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them. The
Congress of People's Deputies
was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989, the first in Soviet history. The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, and much stronger than before. For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers.
[135]
In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the
President of the Soviet Union
, concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government,
[136]
now renamed the
Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR
, to himself.
[137]
Tensions grew between the Union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by
Boris Yeltsin
and controlling the newly elected
Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR
, and communist hardliners. On 19-21 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged a
coup attempt
. The coup failed, and the
State Council of the Soviet Union
became the highest organ of state power 'in the period of transition'.
[138]
Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR.

) and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet. The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts. The Soviet Union used the
inquisitorial system
of
Roman law
, where the judge,
procurator
, and defence attorney collaborate to "establish the truth".

Human rights
Main article:
Human rights in the Soviet Union
Human rights
in the Soviet Union were severely limited. The Soviet Union was a
totalitarian state
from
1927 until 1953
[141]
[142]
[143]
[144]
and a
one-party
state until 1990.
[145]
Freedom of speech
was suppressed and dissent was punished. Independent political activities were not tolerated, whether these involved participation in free
labor unions
, private
corporations
, independent churches or opposition
political parties
. The
freedom of movement
within and especially outside the country was limited. The state restricted rights of citizens to
private property
.
The Soviet conception of human rights was very different from
international law
. According to
Soviet legal theory
, "it is the government who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted
against
the individual".
[146]
The
Soviet state
was considered as the source of human rights.
[147]
Therefore, the Soviet legal system regarded
law
as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government.
[148]
Extensive
extrajudicial powers
were given to the
Soviet secret police agencies
. The Soviet government in practice significantly curbed the
rule of law
,
civil liberties
,
protection of law
,
freedom of movement
[149]
and
guarantees of property
,
[148]
[150]
which were considered as examples of "bourgeois morality" by Soviet law theorists such as
Andrey Vyshinsky
.
[151]
According to
Vladimir Lenin
, the purpose of
socialist courts
was "not to eliminate
terror
... but to substantiate it and legitimize it in principle".
[148]
The Soviet Union signed legally-binding human rights documents, such as the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
in 1973, but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities.

During his rule, Stalin always made the final policy decisions. Otherwise, Soviet foreign policy was set by the commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union
, or by the party's highest body the
Politburo
. Operations were handled by the separate
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
. It was known as the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (or Narkomindel), until 1946. The most influential spokesmen were
Georgy Chicherin
(1872-1936),
Maxim Litvinov
(1876-1951),
Vyacheslav Molotov
(1890-1986),
Andrey Vyshinsky
(1883-1954) and
Andrei Gromyko
(1909-1989). Intellectuals were based in the
Moscow State Institute of International Relations
.
[153]
Comintern (1919-1943), or
Communist International
, was an international communist organization based in the Kremlin that advocated
world communism
. The Comintern intended to 'struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state'.
[154]
It was abolished as a conciliatory measure toward Britain and the United States.
[155]
Comecon
, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Russian: Совет Экономической Взаимопомощи,
Sovet Ekonomicheskoy Vzaimopomoshchi
, СЭВ, SEV) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under Soviet control that comprised the countries of the Eastern Bloc along with several communist states elsewhere in the world. Moscow was concerned about the
Marshall Plan
, and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets' sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia. Comecon was the Eastern Bloc's reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Organization for European Economic Co-Operation (OEEC),
[156]
[157]
The
Warsaw Pact
was a
collective defence
alliance formed in 1955 among the USSR and its
satellite states
in Eastern Europe during the Cold War.
[158]
[159]
The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Comecon, the regional economic organization for the
socialist states
of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of
West Germany
into
NATO
.
[160]
[158]
Although nominally a "defensive" alliance, the Pact's primary function was to safeguard the
Soviet Union's hegemony
over its
Eastern European
satellites, with the Pact's only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away.
[81]
[158]
[161]
[162]
The
Cominform
(1947-1956), informally the Communist Information Bureau and officially the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, was the first official agency of the international Marxist-Leninist movement since the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943. Its role was to coordinate actions between Marxist-Leninist parties under Soviet direction. Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the
Marshall Plan
, the U.S. program of rebuilding Europe after the war and developing its economy.
[163]
It also coordinated international aid to Marxist-Leninist insurgents during the Greek Civil War in 1947-1949.
[164]
It expelled Yugoslavia in 1948 after
Josip Broz Tito
insisted on an independent program. Its newspaper,
For a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy!
, promoted Stalin's positions. The Cominform's concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy. By enunciating a uniform ideology, it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues.
[165]

The Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Soviet Union intensely debated foreign policy issues and changed directions several times. Even after Stalin assumed dictatorial control in the late 1920s, there were debates, and he frequently changed positions.
[166]
During the country's early period, it was assumed that Communist revolutions would break out soon in every major industrial country, and it was the Russian responsibility to assist them. The
Comintern
was the weapon of choice. A few revolutions did break out, but they were quickly suppressed (the longest lasting one was in Hungary)—the
Hungarian Soviet Republic
—lasted only from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919. The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help.
By 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon. It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead. Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany. The two came to terms in 1922 with the
Treaty of Rapallo
that settled long-standing grievances. At the same time, the two countries secretly set up training programs for the illegal German army and air force operations at hidden camps in the USSR.
[167]
Moscow eventually stopped threatening other states, and instead worked to open peaceful relationships in terms of trade, and diplomatic recognition. The United Kingdom dismissed the warnings of
Winston Churchill
and a few others about a continuing Marxist-Leninist threat, and opened trade relations and
de facto
diplomatic recognition in 1922. There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war Tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed. Formal recognition came when the new
Labour Party
came to power in 1924.
[168]
All the other countries followed suit in opening trade relations.
Henry Ford
opened large-scale business relations with the Soviets in the late 1920s, hoping that it would lead to long-term peace. Finally, in 1933, the United States officially recognized the USSR, a decision backed by the public opinion and especially by US business interests that expected an opening of a new profitable market.
[169]
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Stalin ordered Marxist-Leninist parties across the world to strongly oppose non-Marxist political parties, labor unions or other organizations on the left, which they labelled
social fascists
. In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, the epithet
fascist
was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any
anti-Soviet
or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.
[170]
Stalin reversed himself in 1934 with the
Popular Front
program that called on all Marxist parties to join with all
anti-Fascist
political, labor, and organizational forces that were opposed to
fascism
, especially of the
Nazi
variety.
[171]
[172]
The rapid growth of power in Nazi Germany encouraged both Paris and Moscow to form a military alliance, and the
Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance
was signed in May 1935. A firm believer in collective security, Stalin's foreign minister
Maxim Litvinov
worked very hard to form a closer relationship with France and Britain.
[173]
In 1939, half a year after the
Munich Agreement
, the USSR attempted to form an anti-Nazi alliance with France and Britain.
[174]
Adolf Hitler
proposed a better deal, which would give the USSR control over much of Eastern Europe through the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
. In September, Germany invaded Poland, and the USSR also invaded later that month, resulting in the partition of Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of
World War II
.

, the Soviet Union did not cooperate with any other nation, choosing to follow its own path.

However, after

Vyacheslav Molotov
dropped his post war border demands.

Cold War (1945-1991)

Origins of the Cold War
and
Cold War
The
Cold War
was a period of
geopolitical
tension between the
United States
and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the
Western Bloc
and the
Eastern Bloc
, which began following
World War II
in 1945. The term
cold war
is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two
superpowers
, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as
proxy wars
. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary
alliance
and
victory
against
Nazi Germany
in 1945. Aside from the
nuclear arsenal development
and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as
psychological warfare
, propaganda campaigns,
espionage
, far-reaching
embargoes
, rivalry at
sports events
and technological competitions such as the
Space Race
.

Republics of the Soviet Union
Constitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as
Ukraine
or
Byelorussia
(SSRs), or federations, such as
Russia
or
Transcaucasia
(SFSRs),
[110]
all four being the founding republics who signed the
Treaty on the Creation of the USSR
in December 1922. In 1924, during the
national delimitation
in Central Asia,
Uzbekistan
and
Turkmenistan
were formed from parts of Russia's
Turkestan ASSR
and two Soviet dependencies, the
Khorezm
and
Bukharan PSPs
. In 1929,
Tajikistan
was split off from the Uzbekistan SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of
Armenia
,
Georgia
and
Azerbaijan
being elevated to Union Republics, while
Kazakhstan
and
Kirghizia
were split off from the Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.
[178]
In August 1940,
Moldavia
was formed from parts of Ukraine and
Soviet-occupied Bessarabia
, and Ukrainian SSR.
Estonia
,
Latvia
and
Lithuania
were also
annexed by the Soviet Union
and turned into SSRs, which was
not recognized by most of the international community
and was considered an
illegal occupation
. After the
Soviet invasion of Finland
, the
Karelo-Finnish SSR
was formed on annexed territory as a Union Republic in March 1940 and then incorporated into Russia as the
Karelian ASSR
in 1956. Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).
[179]
While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by
Russians
. The domination was so absolute that for most of its existence, the country was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as 'Russia'. While the Russian SFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and area), most powerful, and most highly developed. The Russian SFSR was also the industrial center of the Soviet Union. Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was 'window dressing' for Russian dominance. For that reason, the people of the USSR were usually called 'Russians', not 'Soviets', since 'everyone knew who really ran the show'.

Under the Military Law of September 1925, the
Soviet Armed Forces
consisted of the
Land Forces
, the
Air Force
, the
Navy
,
Joint State Political Directorate
(OGPU) and the
Internal Troops
.
[180]
The OGPU later became independent and in 1934 joined the
NKVD
secret police, and so its internal troops were under the joint leadership of the defense and internal commissariats. After World War II,
Strategic Missile Forces
(1959),
Air Defense Forces
(1948) and National Civil Defense Forces (1970) were formed, which ranked first, third, and sixth in the official Soviet system of importance (ground forces were second, Air Force fourth, and Navy fifth).
The army had the greatest political influence. In 1989, there served two million soldiers divided between 150 motorized and 52 armored divisions. Until the early 1960s, the Soviet navy was a rather small military branch, but after the
Caribbean crisis
, under the leadership of
Sergei Gorshkov
, it expanded significantly. It became known for
battlecruisers
and submarines. In 1989, there served 500 000 men. The
Soviet Air Force
focused on a fleet of
strategic bombers
and during war situation was to eradicate enemy infrastructure and nuclear capacity. The air force also had a number of
fighters
and tactical bombers to support the army in the war. Strategic missile forces had more than 1,400
intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs), deployed between 28 bases and 300 command centers.
In the post-war period, the Soviet Army was directly involved in several military operations abroad.
[7]
[181]
[182]
These included the suppression of the
uprising in East Germany
(1953),
Hungarian revolution
(1956) and the
invasion of Czechoslovakia
(1968). The Soviet Union also participated in the
war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989
.
In the Soviet Union, general
conscription
applied, meaning all able-bodied males aged 18 and older were drafted in the armed forces.

The Soviet Union adopted a
command economy
, whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of
war communism
, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive or forced requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and
free trade
. The
barrier troops
were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army, a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population.
[184]
After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the
New Economic Policy
(NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses. The economy steadily recovered as a result.
[185]
After a long debate among the members of the Politburo about the course of economic development, by 1928-1929, upon gaining control of the country, Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting
forced collectivization of agriculture
and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for
rapid industrialization
, which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s.
[185]
The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world.
[186]
As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after
World War II
.
[187]
The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure, which required massive reconstruction.
[188]
The

By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively
self-sufficient
; for most of the period until the creation of
Comecon
, only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally.
[189]
After the creation of the
Eastern Bloc
, external trade rose rapidly. However, the influence of the
world economy
on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on
foreign trade
.
[190]
Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.
[189]
During the
arms race
of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the USSR became the largest arms exporter to the
Third World
. A portion of Soviet resources during the Cold War were
allocated in aid
to the Soviet-aligned states.
[189]
The Soviet Union's
military budget
in the 1970s was gigantic, forming 40-60% of the entire federal budget and accounting to 15% of the USSR's GDP (13% in the 1980s).
[191]

From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by
central planning
, carried out by
Gosplan
and organized in
five-year plans
. However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to
ad hoc
intervention by superiors. All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in
rubles
rather than in physical goods.
Credit
was discouraged, but widespread. The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice they were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (e.g. between producer factories) were widespread.
[185]
A number of basic
services
were state-funded, such as
education
and health care. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over
consumer goods
.
[192]
Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety. Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices.
[193]
A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not. The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the
reform of 1965
.

Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely,
[194]
[195]
by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, it had comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West.
[196]
However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive,
steadily declined
much more quickly and consistently than in other countries, despite a rapid increase in the capital
stock
(the rate of capital increase was only surpassed by Japan).
[185]
Volzhsky Avtomobilny Zavod
(VAZ) in 1969
Overall, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1989 was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries).
[197]
A 1986 study published in the
American Journal of Public Health
claimed that, citing
World Bank
data, the Soviet model provided a better
quality of life
and
human development
than market economies at the same level of economic development in most cases.
[198]
According to
Stanley Fischer
and
William Easterly
, growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income in 1989 should have been twice higher than it was, considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to the low productivity of capital.
[199]
Steven Rosefielde states that the
standard of living
declined due to Stalin's despotism. While there was a brief improvement after his death, it lapsed into stagnation.
[200]
In 1987,
Mikhail Gorbachev
attempted to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of
perestroika
. His policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not replace it by market incentives, resulting in a sharp decline in output. The economy, already suffering from
reduced petroleum export revenues
, started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and the property was still largely state-owned until after the country's dissolution.
[185]
[193]
For most of the period after World War II until its collapse, Soviet GDP (
PPP
) was
the second-largest in the world
, and third during the second half of the 1980s,
[201]
although on a
per-capita
basis, it was behind that of
First World
countries.
[202]
Compared to countries with similar per-capita GDP in 1928, the Soviet Union experienced significant growth.

only 2.6%.
[205]
David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40% of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.
[206]
The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2-2.5% during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields.
[

[207]
However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the
First World
.
[208]
In 1991, the Soviet Union had a
pipeline
network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for
crude oil
and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas.
[209]
Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported.
[210]
In the 1970s and 1980s, the USSR heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn
hard currency
.
[189]
At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second-largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by
Saudi Arabia
.

The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on
science and technology
within its economy,
[212]
[97]
however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the
world's first space satellite
, typically were the responsibility of the military.
[192]
Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding. Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations. In the early 1960s, the Soviets awarded 40% of chemistry PhDs to women, compared to only 5% in the United States.
[213]
By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as Energy physics, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies. Due to rigid state planning and
bureaucracy
, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the
First World
. The Soviet government opposed and persecuted
geneticists
in favour of
Lysenkoism
, a
pseudoscience
rejected by the scientific community in the Soviet Union and abroad but supported by Stalin's inner circles. Implemented in the USSR and China, it resulted in reduced crop yields and is widely believed to have contributed to the
Great Chinese Famine
.
[214]
The Soviet Union also had more
scientists
and
engineers
, relative to the world population, than any other major country due to the strong levels of state support for scientific developments by the 1980s.
[215]
Under the
Reagan administration
,
Project Socrates
determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous
research and development
as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the USSR was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and use of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.

At the end of the 1950s, the USSR constructed the first
satellite
—
Sputnik 1
, which marked the beginning of the
Space Race
—a competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability with the United States.
[219]
This was followed by other successful satellites, most notably
Sputnik 5
, where test dogs were sent to space. On 12 April 1961, the USSR launched
Vostok 1
, which carried
Yuri Gagarin
, making him the first human to ever be launched into space and complete a space journey.
[220]
At that time, the first plans for
space shuttles
and orbital stations were drawn up in Soviet design offices, but in the end personal disputes between designers and management prevented this.
As for Lunar space program, the USSR only had
a program on automated spacecraft launches
with no crewed spacecraft used, passing on the 'Moon Race' part of
Space Race
, which was decidedly
won by the Americans
. The public's reaction to American astronauts' Moon-landing in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.
[221]
[222]
In the 1970s, specific proposals for the design of the space shuttle began to emerge, but shortcomings, especially in the electronics industry (rapid overheating of electronics), postponed the program until the end of the 1980s. The first shuttle, the
Buran
, flew in 1988, but without a human crew. Another shuttle,
Ptichka
, eventually ended up under prolonged construction, as the shuttle project was canceled in 1991. For their launch into space, there is today an unused superpower rocket,
Energia
, which is the most powerful in the world.
[223]
In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union managed to build the
Mir
orbital station. It was built on the construction of
Salyut
stations
and its only role was civilian-grade research tasks.
[224]
[225]
Mir was the only orbital station in operation from 1986 to 1998. Gradually, other modules were added to it, including American ones. However, the station deteriorated rapidly after a fire on board, so in 2001 it was decided to bring it into the atmosphere where it burned down.

Transport was a vital component of the country's economy. The
economic centralization
of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of
Aeroflot
, an aviation
enterprise
.
[226]
The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.
[209]
However, due to inadequate maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.
[227]
Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world;
[227]
it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts.
[228]
By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burdens from the railways and to improve the Soviet
government budget
.
[229]
The
street network
and
automotive industry
[230]
remained underdeveloped,
[231]
and
dirt roads
were common outside major cities.
[232]
Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones.
[232]
Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction.
[233]
The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.
[234]
Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still
[
when?
]
riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making. Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.
[235]
The Soviet

Demographics of the Soviet Union
Population of the Soviet Union (red) and the
post-Soviet states
(blue) from 1961 to 2009 as well as projection (dotted blue) from 2010 to 2100
Excess deaths throughout
World War I
and the
Russian Civil War
(including the
famine of 1921-1922
that was triggered by Lenin's
war communism
policies)
[236]
amounted to a combined total of 18 million,
[237]
some 10 million in the 1930s,
[48]
and more than 20 million in 1941-1945. The postwar
Soviet population
was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.
[238]
According to
Catherine Merridale
, '...
reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million.'
[239]
The
birth rate
of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mainly due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The
mortality rate
demonstrated a gradual decrease as well—from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post-World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics.
[240]
Soviet Europe moved towards
sub-replacement fertility
, while
Soviet Central Asia
continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.
[241]
The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.
[242]
An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again.
[243]
The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as mostly real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.
[244]
The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the
Soviet government
stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed, and researchers could delve into the real causes.
[245]
Women and fertility

Under Lenin, the state made explicit commitments to promote the equality of men and women. Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution, and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies. Beginning in October 1918, Lenin's government liberalized divorce and abortion laws, decriminalized homosexuality (re-criminalized in 1932), permitted cohabitation, and ushered in a host of reforms.
[246]
However, without
birth control
, the new system produced many broken marriages, as well as countless out-of-wedlock children.
[247]
The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy. Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their country's military power. By 1936, Stalin reversed most of the liberal laws, ushering in a pronatalist era that lasted for decades.
[248]
By 1917, Russia became the first
great power
to grant women the right to vote.
[249]
After heavy casualties in World War I and II, women outnumbered men in Russia by a 4:3 ratio.
[250]
This contributed to the larger role women played in Russian society compared to other great powers at the time.

For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity. By 1940, Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated. Throughout the 1930s,
social mobility
rose sharply, which has been attributed to reforms in education.
[255]
In the aftermath of World War II, the country's educational system expanded dramatically, which had a tremendous effect. In the 1960s, nearly all children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas.
Nikita Khrushchev
tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society. Education also became important in giving rise to the
New Man
.
[256]
Citizens directly entering the workforce had the constitutional right to a job and to free
vocational training
.
The
education system
was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with
affirmative action
for applicants from nations associated with
cultural backwardness
. However, as part of a general
antisemitic policy
, an unofficial
Jewish quota
was applied
[
when?
]
in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations.
[257]
[258]
[259]
[260]
The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local
Komsomol
party secretary.
[261]
According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the US.

The Soviet Union was an ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups. The total population of the country was estimated at 293 million in 1991. According to a 1990 estimate, the majority of the population were
Russians
(50.78%), followed by
Ukrainians
(15.45%) and
Uzbeks
(5.84%).
[263]
Overall, in 1989 the ethnic demography of the country showed that 69.8% was
East Slavic
, 17.5% was
Turkic
, 1.6% were
Armenians
, 1.6% were
Balts
, 1.5% were
Finnic
, 1.5% were
Tajik
, 1.4% were
Georgian
, 1.2% were
Moldovan
and 4.1% were of other various ethnic groups.
[264]
All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.
[265]
If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the
Mingrelians
of
Georgia
, who were classified with the linguistically related
Georgians
.
[266]
Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians,
Belarusians
, and Ukrainians, who were all East Slavic and Orthodox, shared close cultural, ethnic, and religious ties, while other groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory,
ethnic antagonisms
developed over the years.
[267]
[
neutrality

]
Members of various ethnicities participated in legislative bodies. Organs of power like the Politburo, the Secretariat of the Central Committee etc., were formally ethnically neutral, but in reality, ethnic Russians were overrepresented, although there were also non-Russian leaders in the
Soviet leadership
, such as
Joseph Stalin
,
Grigory Zinoviev
,
Nikolai Podgorny
or
Andrei Gromyko
. During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there. According to the last census in 1989, the Russian 'diaspora' in the Soviet republics had reached 25 million.

Health care in the Soviet Union
An early Soviet-era poster discouraging unsafe abortion practices
In 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries. As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice".
[269]
The Soviet health care system was conceived by the
People's Commissariat for Health
in 1918. Under the
Semashko model
, health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time. Article 42 of the
1977 Soviet Constitution
gave all citizens the
right to health
protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before
Leonid Brezhnev
became general secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and
Mikhail Gorbachev
's tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.
[270]
Minister of Health
Yevgeniy Chazov
, during the
19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
, while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of
rubles
were squandered.
[271]
After the revolution, life expectancy for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the
socialist system
was superior to the
capitalist system
. These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States. Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of
alcohol abuse
. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.
[272]
Dentistry
Soviet dental technology and dental health were considered notoriously bad. In 1991, the average 35-year-old had 12 to 14 cavities, fillings or missing teeth. Toothpaste was often not available, and toothbrushes did not conform to standards of modern dentistry.

Language
Main articles:

Reforms of Russian orthography
Under Lenin, the government gave small language groups their own writing systems.
[275]
The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same
multilingual
situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed
dialectally
greatly from each other.
[276]
When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, it would attain 'official language' status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore, their speakers were forced to have a
second language
.
[277]
There are examples where the government retreated from this policy, most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian.
[278]
During World War II, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.
[279]
As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union's many languages, Russian
de facto
functioned as an official language, as the 'language of interethnic communication' (Russian:
язык межнационального общения
), but only assumed the
de jure
status as the official national language in 1990.

Eastern Christianity
predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional
Russian Orthodox Church
being the largest
Christian denomination
. About 90% of the Soviet Union's Muslims were
Sunnis
, with
Shias
being concentrated in the
Azerbaijan SSR
.
[281]
Smaller groups included
Roman Catholics
, Jews,
Buddhists
, and a variety of
Protestant
denominations (especially
Baptists
and
Lutherans
).
[281]
Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire. The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.
[282]
The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former
ruling classes
.
[283]
In Soviet law, the 'freedom to hold religious services' was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the
Marxist
spirit of
scientific materialism
.
[283]
In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact used a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups.
[283]
The 1918
Council of People's Commissars
decree establishing the Russian SFSR as a secular state also decreed that 'the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden. Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately.'
[284]
Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929 included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized
Bible study
.
[283]
Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, as many as 90% of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed; the majority of them were demolished or re-purposed for state needs with little concern for their historic and cultural value.
[285]
More than 85,000 Orthodox priests were shot in 1937 alone.
[286]
Only a twelfth of the Russian Orthodox Church's priests were left functioning in their parishes by 1941.
[287]
In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in Russia fell from 29,584 to less than 500 (1.7%).
[288]
The Soviet Union was officially a
secular state
,
[289]
[290]
but a 'government-sponsored program of forced conversion to
atheism
' was conducted under the doctrine of
state atheism
.
[291]
[292]
[293]
The government targeted religions based on state interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools.
[294]
In 1925, the government founded the
League of Militant Atheists
to intensify the propaganda campaign.
[295]
Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the formal structures and mass media, and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious. While persecution accelerated following Stalin's rise to power, a revival of Orthodoxy was fostered by the government during World War II and the Soviet authorities sought to control the Russian Orthodox Church rather than liquidate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941, only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence before World War I.
Convinced that religious
anti-Sovietism
had become a thing of the past, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s.
[296]
Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during World War II. Amid other accommodations to religious faith after the German invasion, churches were reopened.
Radio Moscow
began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader
Patriarch Sergius of Moscow
was held in 1943. Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the USSR even through the late 1980s.
[296]
The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.
[297]
Under
Nikita Khrushchev
, the state leadership clashed with the churches in 1958-1964, a period when
atheism
was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views.
[296]
During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.
[298]
The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade.
[298]
Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the
Brezhnev era
.
[299]
Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch
Alexy I
with the
Order of the Red Banner of Labour
.
[300]
A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20% of the Soviet population as 'active religious believers.'

The USSR implemented a broad range of policies over a long period of time, with a large amount of conflicting policies being implemented by different leaders. Some have a positive view of it whilst others are critical towards the country, calling it a repressive

According to Western analysis, the economic shocks that accompanied wholesale
privatization
were associated with sharp increases in mortality,
[326]
Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994,
[327]
[328]
and in the following decades, only five or six of the post-communist states are on a path to joining the wealthy capitalist West while most are falling behind, some to such an extent that it will take over fifty years to catch up to where they were before the fall of the Soviet Bloc.
[329]
[330]
Since the
dissolution of the Soviet Union
, annual polling by the
Levada Center
has shown that over 50% of Russia's population regretted this event, with the only exception to this being in the year 2012 when support for the Soviet Union dipped below 50 percent.
[331]
A 2018 poll showed that 66% of Russians regretted the fall of the Soviet Union, setting a 15-year record, and the majority of these regretting opinions came from people older than 55.
[331]
[332]
In 2020, polls conducted by the Levada Center found that 75% of Russians agreed that the Soviet era was the greatest era in their country's history.
[333]
According to the New Russia Barometer (NRB) polls by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy, 50% of Russian respondents reported a positive impression of the Soviet Union in 1991.
[334]
This increased to about 75% of NRB respondents in 2000, dropping slightly to 71% in 2009.
[334]
Throughout the 2000s, an average of 32% of NRB respondents supported the restoration of the Soviet Union.
[334]
In a 2021 poll, a record 70% of
Russians
indicated they had a mostly/very favourable view of

In a 2018
Rating Sociological Group
poll, 47% of Ukrainian respondents had a positive opinion of Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev
, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, while viewing
Lenin
, Stalin and
Gorbachev
very negatively.
[337]
A 2021 poll conducted by the Levada Center found that 49% of Russians prefer the USSR's political system, while 18% prefer the current political system and 16% would prefer a
Western democracy
. A further 62% of people polled preferred the Soviet system of central planning, while 24% prefer a market-based system.
[338]
According to the Levada Center's polls, the primary reasons cited for Soviet nostalgia are the advantages of the shared economic union between the Soviet republics, including perceived financial stability.
[339]
This was referenced by up to 53% of respondents in 2016.
[339]
At least 43% also lamented the loss of the Soviet Union's global political superpower status.
[339]
About 31% cited the loss of social trust and capital.
[340]
The remainder of the respondents cited a mix of reasons ranging from practical travel difficulties to a sense of national displacement.
[339]
The 1941-1945 period of World War II is still known in Russia as the '
Great Patriotic War
'. The war became a topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts. As a result of the
massive losses
suffered by the military and civilians during the conflict,
Victory Day
celebrated on 9 May is still one of the most important and emotional dates in Russia.
[341]
Catherine Wanner asserts that Victory Day commemorations are a vehicle for Soviet nostalgia, as they "kept alive a mythology of Soviet grandeur, of solidarity among the
Sovietskii narod
, and of a sense of self as citizen of a superpower state".
[342]
Russian Victory Day parades are organized annually in most cities, with the central military parade taking place in
Moscow
(just as during the Soviet times).
[343]
[344]
Additionally, the recently introduced

In some post-Soviet republics, there is a more negative view of the USSR, although there is no unanimity on the matter. In large part due to the
Holodomor
, ethnic
Ukrainians
have a negative view of the Soviet Union.
[347]
Russian
-speaking Ukrainians of Ukraine's southern and eastern regions have a more positive view of the USSR. In some countries with internal conflict, there is also nostalgia for the USSR, especially for
refugees
of the
post-Soviet conflicts
who have been forced to flee their homes and have been displaced. This nostalgia is less an admiration for the country or its policies than it is a longing to return to their homes. The many Russian enclaves in the former USSR republics such as
Transnistria
have in a general a positive remembrance of it.

Criticism of communist party rule § Left-wing criticism
The left's view of the USSR is complex. While some leftists regard the USSR as an example of state capitalism or that it was an oligarchical state, other leftists admire
Vladimir Lenin
and the
Russian Revolution
.
[349]
Council communists
generally view the USSR as failing to create
class consciousness
, turning into a corrupt state in which the elite controlled society.
Many
anti-Stalinist leftists
such as anarchists are extremely critical of Soviet authoritarianism and
repression
. Much of the criticism it receives is centered around
massacres in the Soviet Union
, the centralized
hierarchy
present in the USSR and mass
political repression
as well as violence towards government critics and
political dissidents
such as other leftists. Critics also point towards its failure to implement any substantial
worker cooperatives
or implementing worker liberation, as well as corruption and the Soviet authoritarian nature.

Anarchists are also critical of the country, labeling the Soviet system as
red fascism
. Factors contributing to the anarchist animosity towards the USSR included the Soviet destruction of the
Makhnovist movement
after an initial alliance, the suppression of the anarchist
Kronstadt rebellion
, and the defeat of the rival anarchist factions by the Soviet-supported Communist faction during the
Spanish Civil War
.
[350]
Maoists
also have a mixed opinion on the USSR, viewing it negatively during the
Sino-Soviet Split
and denouncing it as revisionist and reverted to capitalism. The Chinese government in 1963 articulated its criticism of the USSR's system and promoted China's ideological line as an alternative.
[351]
[352]
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the
Japanese Communist Party
(JCP) released a press statement titled "We welcome the end of a party which embodied the historical evil of
great power
chauvinism
and
hegemonism
".
[353]
Noam Chomsky
called the collapse of the Soviet Union "a small victory for socialism, not only because of the fall of one of the most anti-socialist states in the world, where working people had fewer rights than in the West, but also because it freed the term 'socialism' from the burden of being associated in the propaganda systems of East and West with Soviet tyranny — for the East, in order to benefit from the aura of authentic socialism, for the West, in order to demonize the concept."

Soviet singer-songwriter, poet and actor
Vladimir Vysotsky
in 1979
The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR's existence. During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, such as
Nikolay Gumilyov
who was shot for alleged conspiracy against the Bolshevik regime, and
Yevgeny Zamyatin
.
[355]
The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers
Maxim Gorky
and
Vladimir Mayakovsky
were active during this time. As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director
Sergei Eisenstein
's best work dates from this period.
During Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of
socialist realism
, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as
Mikhail Bulgakov
's works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed.
[356]
Following the
Khrushchev Thaw
, censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author
Yury Trifonov
concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. Underground dissident literature, known as
samizdat
, developed during this late period. In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch. In music, in response to the increasing popularity of forms of popular music like jazz in the West, many jazz orchestras were permitted throughout the USSR, notably the Melodiya Ensemble, named after the principle record label in the USSR.
In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of
perestroika
and
glasnost
significantly expanded
freedom of expression
throughout the country in the media and the press.

Ice Hockey World Championships
, winning eight gold medals, two silvers and one bronze.
In summer of 1923 in Moscow was established the
Proletarian Sports Society "Dynamo"
as a sports organization of Soviet secret police
Cheka
.
Founded on 20 July 1924 in Moscow,
Sovetsky Sport
was the first sports newspaper of the Soviet Union.
On 13 July 1925 the
Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
adopted a statement "About the party's tasks in sphere of physical culture". In the statement was determined the role of physical culture in Soviet society and the party's tasks in political leadership of physical culture movement in the country.
The
Soviet Olympic Committee
formed on 21 April 1951, and the
IOC
recognized the new body in its
45th session
. In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the
Olympic Movement
. The
1952 Summer Olympics
in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. The Soviet Union was the biggest rival to the United States at the Summer Olympics, winning
six of its nine appearances at the games
and also topping the medal tally at the Winter Olympics six times. The Soviet Union's Olympics success has been attributed to its large investment in sports to demonstrate its superpower image and political influence on a global stage.
[358]
The
Soviet Union national ice hockey team
won nearly every
world championship
and
Olympic tournament
between 1954 and 1991 and never failed to medal in any
International Ice Hockey Federation
(IIHF) tournament in which they competed.
Soviet Olympic team was notorious for skirting the edge of amateur rules. All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the
United States
and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.
[359]
[360]
Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the
1984 Winter games
, after another Eastern bloc nation, the
GDR
. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the
fall of the USSR
.
[361]
[362]
According to
British
journalist
Andrew Jennings
, a
KGB
colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the
International Olympic Committee
(IOC) to undermine
doping tests
and that Soviet athletes were "rescued with [these] tremendous efforts".
[363]
[364]
On the topic of the
1980 Summer Olympics
, a 1989 Australian study said "There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games."
[363]
A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to
epitestosterone
in
urine
. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists, would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.
[365]
The first documented case of '
blood doping
' occurred at the 1980 Summer Olympics when a runner
[
who?
]
was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5000 m and 10,000 m.
[366]
Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the
1984 Summer Olympics
in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.
[367]
The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Geography
Main article:
Geography of the Soviet Union
Mountain
Khan Tengri
(6,995 m) of the
Tian Shan
mountain range.
The Soviet Union covered an area of over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), and was the world's largest country,
[71]
a status that is retained by its successor state, Russia.
[368]
It covered a sixth of Earth's land surface, and its size was comparable to the continent of North America.
[369]
Its western part in Europe accounted for a quarter of the country's area and was the cultural and economic center. The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and
Afghanistan
to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia, was much less populous. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across eleven
time zones
, and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south. It had five climate zones:
tundra
,
taiga
,
steppes
,
desert
and mountains.
The Soviet Union,
similarly to modern Russia
, had the world's longest border, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or
1
+
1
⁄
2
circumferences of Earth. Two-thirds of it was a
coastline
. The country bordered (from 1945 to 1991):
Norway
,
Finland
, the
Baltic Sea
,
Poland
,
Czechoslovakia
,
Hungary
,
Romania
, the
Black Sea
,
Turkey
,
Iran
, the
Caspian Sea
,
Afghanistan
, China,
Mongolia
, and
North Korea
. The
Bering Strait
separated the country from the United States, while the
La Pérouse Strait
separated it from Japan.
The Soviet Union's highest mountain was Communism Peak (now
Ismoil Somoni Peak
) in
Tajik SSR
, at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft). It also included most of the world's largest lakes; the
Caspian Sea
(shared with
Iran
), and
Lake Baikal
in Russia, the world's largest and deepest freshwater lake.

One of the many impacts of the approach to the environment in the USSR and post-Soviet states is the
Aral Sea
. (See status in 1989 and 2014.)
Landscape near
Karabash, Chelyabinsk Oblast
, an area that was previously covered with forests until acid rainfall from a nearby copper smelter killed all vegetation
The Soviet
Chernobyl disaster
in 1986 was the first major accident at a civilian
nuclear power plant
. Unparalleled in the world, it resulted in a large number of radioactive isotopes being released into the atmosphere. Radioactive doses have scattered relatively far. 4,000 new cases of thyroid cancer were reported after the incident, but this led to a relatively low number of deaths (WHO data, 2005).
[370]
However, the long-term effects of the accident are unknown. Another major accident is the
Kyshtym disaster
.
[371]
After the
dissolution of the Soviet Union
, it was discovered that the environmental problems were greater than what the Soviet authorities admitted. The
Kola Peninsula
was one of the places with clear problems. Around the industrial cities of
Monchegorsk
and
Norilsk
, where
nickel
, for example, is mined, all forests have been destroyed by contamination, while the northern and other parts of Russia have been affected by emissions. During the 1990s, people in the West were also interested in the radioactive hazards of nuclear facilities, decommissioned
nuclear submarines
, and the processing of
nuclear waste
or
spent nuclear fuel
. It was also known in the early 1990s that the USSR had transported radioactive material to the
Barents Sea
and
Kara Sea
, which was later confirmed by the Russian parliament. The crash of the
K-141 Kursk
submarine in 2000 in the west further raised concerns.
[372]
In the past, there were accidents involving submarines
K-19
,
K-8
, a
K-129
,
K-27
,
K-219
and
K-278 Komsomolets
.

Software documentation
is written text or illustration that accompanies computer
software
or is embedded in the source code.  The documentation either explains how the software operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.
Documentation
is an important part of software engineering. Types of documentation include:
Requirements
- Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system.  This is the foundation for what will be or has been implemented.
Architecture/Design - Overview of software. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components.
Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and
APIs
.
End user
- Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.
Marketing - How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.
Types
[
edit
]
Requirements documentation
[
edit
]
Requirements
documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is used throughout
development
to communicate how the software functions or how it is intended to operate. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software will do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software, including:
end users
,
customers
,
project managers
,
sales
,
marketing
,
software architects
,
usability engineers
,
interaction designers
,
developers
, and
testers
.
Requirements come in a variety of styles, notations and formality. Requirements can be goal-like (e.g.,
distributed work environment
), close to design (e.g.,
builds can be started by right-clicking a configuration file and selecting the 'build' function
), and anything in between. They can be specified as statements in
natural language
, as drawn figures, as detailed
mathematical formulas
, or as a combination of them all.
The variation and complexity of requirement documentation make it a proven challenge. Requirements may be implicit and hard to uncover. It is difficult to know exactly how much and what kind of documentation is needed and how much can be left to the architecture and design documentation, and it is difficult to know how to document requirements considering the variety of people who shall read and use the documentation. Thus, requirements documentation is often incomplete (or non-existent). Without proper requirements documentation, software changes become more difficult — and therefore more error prone (decreased
software quality
) and time-consuming (expensive).
The need for requirements documentation is typically related to the complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the
life expectancy
of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have a negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment, mechanical equipment), more formal requirements documentation is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little requirements documentation may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, requirements documentation is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.
Traditionally, requirements are specified in requirements documents (e.g. using word processing applications and spreadsheet applications). To manage the increased complexity and changing nature of requirements documentation (and software documentation in general), database-centric systems and special-purpose
requirements management
tools are advocated.
In Agile software development, requirements are often expressed as User Stories with accompanying acceptance criteria.
Architecture design documentation
[
edit
]
Architecture documentation (also known as
software architecture description
) is a special type of design document. In a way, architecture documents are third derivative from the code (
design document
being second derivative, and code documents being first). Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself. These documents do not describe how to program a particular routine, or even why that particular routine exists in the form that it does, but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such a routine. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.
Another type of design document is the comparison document, or trade study. This would often take the form of a
whitepaper
. It focuses on one specific aspect of the system and suggests alternate approaches. It could be at the
user interface
, code, design, or even architectural level. It will outline what the situation is, describe one or more alternatives, and enumerate the pros and cons of each. A good trade study document is heavy on research, expresses its idea clearly (without relying heavily on obtuse
jargon
to dazzle the reader), and most importantly is impartial. It should honestly and clearly explain the costs of whatever solution it offers as best. The objective of a trade study is to devise the best solution, rather than to push a particular point of view. It is perfectly acceptable to state no conclusion, or to conclude that none of the alternatives are sufficiently better than the baseline to warrant a change. It should be approached as a scientific endeavor, not as a marketing technique.
A very important part of the design document in enterprise software development is the Database Design Document (DDD). It contains Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Elements. The DDD includes the formal information that the people who interact with the database need. The purpose of preparing it is to create a common source to be used by all players within the scene. The potential users are:
Database designer
Database developer
Database administrator
Application designer
Application developer
When talking about
Relational Database
Systems, the document should include following parts:
Entity - Relationship Schema
(
enhanced
or not), including following information and their clear definitions:
Entity Sets and their attributes
Relationships and their attributes
Candidate keys for each entity set
Attribute and Tuple based constraints
Relational Schema, including following information:
Tables, Attributes, and their properties
Views
Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys,
Cardinality of referential constraints
Cascading Policy for referential constraints
Primary keys
It is very important to include all information that is to be used by all actors in the scene. It is also very important to update the documents as any change occurs in the database as well.
Technical documentation
[
edit
]
Main article:
Technical documentation
It is important for the code documents associated with the source code (which may include
README
files and
API
documentation) to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes overly time-consuming or difficult to maintain them. Various how-to and overview documentation guides are commonly found specific to the software application or software product being documented by
API writers
. This documentation may be used by developers, testers, and also end-users. Today, a lot of high-end applications are seen in the fields of power, energy, transportation, networks, aerospace, safety, security, industry automation, and a variety of other domains. Technical documentation has become important within such organizations as the basic and advanced level of information may change over a period of time with architecture changes.
Code documents are often organized into a
reference guide
style, allowing a programmer to quickly look up an arbitrary function or class.
Technical documentation embedded in source code
[
edit
]
Often,
tools
such as
Doxygen
,
NDoc
,
Visual Expert
,
Javadoc
,
JSDoc
,
EiffelStudio
,
Sandcastle
,
ROBODoc
,
POD
,
TwinText
, or Universal Report can be used to auto-generate the code documents—that is, they extract the comments and
software contracts
, where available, from the source code and create reference manuals in such forms as text or
HTML
files.
The idea of auto-generating documentation is attractive to programmers for various reasons.  For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (for example, through
comments
), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation.  This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.
A possible downside is that only programmers can edit this kind of documentation, and it depends on them to refresh the output (for example, by running a
cron job
to update the documents nightly). Some would characterize this as a pro rather than a con.
Literate programming
[
edit
]
Respected computer scientist
Donald Knuth
has noted that documentation can be a very difficult afterthought process and has advocated
literate programming
, written at the same time and location as the
source code
and extracted by automatic means. The programming languages
Haskell
and
CoffeeScript
have built-in support for a simple form of literate programming, but this support is not widely used.
Elucidative programming
[
edit
]
Elucidative Programming is the result of practical applications of Literate Programming in real programming contexts. The Elucidative paradigm proposes that source code and documentation be stored separately.
Often, software developers need to be able to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself. Such
annotations
are usually part of several software development activities, such as code walks and porting, where third-party source code is analysed in a functional way. Annotations can therefore help the developer during any stage of software development where a formal documentation system would hinder progress.
User documentation
[
edit
]
Unlike code documents, user documents simply describe how a program is used.
In the case of a
software library
, the code documents and user documents could in some cases be effectively equivalent and worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true.
Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features. It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.  User documents don't need to be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough
index
. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do.
API Writers
are very well accomplished towards writing good user documents as they would be well aware of the software architecture and programming techniques used. See also
technical writing
.
User documentation can be produced in a variety of online and print formats.
[1]
However, there are three broad ways in which user documentation can be organized.
Tutorial:
A
tutorial
approach is considered the most useful for a new user, in which they are guided through each step of accomplishing particular tasks.
[2]
Thematic:
A
thematic
approach, where chapters or sections concentrate on one particular area of interest, is of more general use to an intermediate user.  Some authors prefer to convey their ideas through a knowledge based article to facilitate the user needs.  This approach is usually practiced by a dynamic industry, such as
Information technology
.
[3]
List or Reference:
The final type of organizing principle is one in which commands or tasks are simply listed alphabetically or logically grouped, often via cross-referenced indexes. This latter approach is of greater use to advanced users who know exactly what sort of information they are looking for.
A common complaint among users regarding software documentation is that only one of these three approaches was taken to the near-exclusion of the other two. It is common to limit provided software documentation for
personal computers
to
online help
that give only reference information on commands or menu items.  The job of tutoring new users or helping more experienced users get the most out of a program is left to private publishers, who are often given significant assistance by the software developer.
Composing user documentation
[
edit
]
Like other forms of technical documentation, good user documentation benefits from an organized process of development. In the case of user documentation, the process as it commonly occurs in industry consists of five steps:
[4]
User analysis
, the basic research phase of the process.
[5]
Planning, or the actual documentation phase.
[6]
Draft review, a self-explanatory phase where feedback is sought on the draft composed in the previous step.
[7]
Usability testing
, whereby the usability of the document is tested empirically.
[8]
Editing
, the final step in which the information collected in steps three and four is used to produce the final draft.
Marketing documentation
[
edit
]
For many applications it is necessary to have some promotional materials to encourage casual observers to spend more time learning about the product.  This form of documentation has three purposes:
To excite the potential user about the product and instill in them a desire for becoming more involved with it.
To inform them about what exactly the product does, so that their expectations are in line with what they will be receiving.
To explain the position of this product with respect to other alternatives.
Documentation and agile development controversy
[
edit
]
"The resistance to documentation among developers is well known and needs no emphasis."
[9]
This situation is particularly prevalent in
agile software development
because these methodologies try to avoid any unnecessary activities that do not directly bring value.
Specifically, the
Agile Manifesto
advocates valuing "working software over comprehensive documentation", which could be interpreted cynically as "We want to spend all our time coding. Remember, real programmers don't write documentation."
[10]
A survey among software engineering experts revealed, however, that documentation is by no means considered unnecessary in agile development.
Yet it is acknowledged that there are motivational problems in development, and that documentation methods tailored to agile development (e.g. through
Reputation systems
and
Gamification
) may be needed.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Ronald Senator
(17 April 1926 - 29 April 2015) was a British composer who divided his time between
New York City
and
London
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Senator, from a Jewish family, studied at
Oxford University
(1944-1947) with
Egon Wellesz
, a distinguished pupil of
Arnold Schoenberg
, and later (1955-58) with
Arnold Cooke
, a pupil of
Paul Hindemith
, at
London University
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Career
[
edit
]
He became a Senior Lecturer in Music at
London University
, then in 1981 was appointed Professor of Composition at the
Guildhall School of Music
. He also held visiting Professorships at universities in
Australia
, the
United States
and
Canada
.
Work
[
edit
]
Senator's
oratorio
Holocaust Requiem
was premiered at
Canterbury Cathedral
in 1986, under the aegis of the
United Nations
, the International Council of Christians and Jews, the Government of
Germany
, and the
B'nai Brith
. It has since been performed in many places worldwide, including the U.S. (Tillis Center, 1988;
Manhattan
, 1990);
Moscow
, 1993;
Czechoslovakia
(
Terezin
1995);
Rome
(1991, one month after the
9/11 attacks
,
Un Concerto per la Pace
). For the Manhattan performance of 1990,
Lukas Foss
conducted the
Brooklyn Philharmonic
and
Ron Silver
was Narrator.
Concerts devoted entirely to Senator's music have been given in
New York City
(1990, 1998, 2001),
London
(1989,1997, 2006),
Sydney
(1978), Moscow (1993), and
St. Petersburg
(1991).
Senator composed six operas and musicals on texts by modern authors including
Anthony Burgess
,
Peter Porter
, and
Ursula Vaughan Williams
. Many of his chamber works are composed for eminent colleagues, such as the singers
Sybil Michelow
,
Jane Manning
,
Willard White
, the violist
Rivka Golani
, the clarinettist
Stanley Drucker
and the pianist
Miriam Brickman
, the composer's wife.
Senator's work as an author includes his
Requiem Letters
, described by
Publishers Weekly
as "a deeply moving and haunting autobiographical memoir".
[4]
Senator established an international reputation as a composer and as a leading innovator in musical education. His work on the universal operations of music, set out in his book
The Gaia of Music
, had a practical counterpart in his system of musical education called
Musicolor
. This was developed in a programme at
London University
sponsored by the British Social Science Research Council, and involved teachers at every level of education. The system has been used in schools and colleges and was the subject of two
BBC
documentaries.
[3]
Senator was a founding member of the Montserrat Composers’ Association for Sacred Music, which was initiated with the support of composers including
Stravinsky
,
Messiaen
,
André Jolivet
and
Penderecki
. He was also the founding director of the National Association of Music Theatre in the
United Kingdom
.
[3]
His music is published by Ricordi, Boosey and Hawkes, EMI, and distributed by Fabermusic.
Death
[
edit
]
Senator and his wife
Miriam Brickman
died in a house fire at their home in Yonkers, New York on 30 April 2015.

Russian Map of the Caucasus and north-eastern Anatolia, 1903
The
Caucasus Greeks
(
Greek
:
Έλληνες του Καυκάσου
or more commonly
Καυκάσιοι Έλληνες
,
Turkish
:
Kafkas Rum
), also known as the
Greeks of Transcaucasia and Russian Asia Minor
, are the ethnic
Greeks
of the
North Caucasus
and
Transcaucasia
in what is now southwestern
Russia
,
Georgia
, and northeastern
Turkey
. These specifically include the
Pontic Greeks
, though they today span a much wider region including the Russian north Caucasus, and the former Russian Caucasus provinces of
Batum Oblast'
and
Kars Oblast'
(the so-called
Russian Asia Minor
), now in north-eastern Turkey and Adjara in Georgia.
[1]
Greek people migrated into these areas well before the Christian/Byzantine era. Traders, Christian Orthodox scholars/clerics, refugees, mercenaries, and those who had backed the wrong side in the many civil wars and periods of political in-fighting in the Classical/Hellenistic and Late Roman/Byzantine periods, were especially represented among those who migrated.
[2]
One notable example is the 7th-century Greek Bishop
Cyrus of Alexandria
, originally from
Phasis
in present-day
Georgia
. Greek settlers in the Caucasus generally became assimilated into the indigenous population, particularly in Georgia, where
Byzantine
Greeks shared a common Christian Orthodox faith and heritage with the natives.
[3]
Official Russian Empire coat of arms of Kars Oblast (1881-1899).
The vast majority of these Greek communities date from the late Ottoman era, and are usually defined in modern Greek academic circles as 'Eastern Pontic [Greeks]' (modern Greek -
ανατολικοί Πόντιοι
, modern Turkish '
doğu Pontos Rum
'), as well as 'Caucasus Greeks', while outside academic discourse they are sometimes defined somewhat pejoratively and inaccurately as 'Russo-Pontic [Greeks]' (modern Greek -
Ρωσο-Πόντιοι
).
[4]
Nevertheless, in general terms Caucasus Greeks can be described as Russianized and pro-Russian empire Pontic Greeks in politics and culture and as
Mountain Greeks
in terms of lifestyle, since wherever they settled, whether in their original homelands in the
Pontic Alps
or
Eastern Anatolia
, or Georgia and the
Lesser Caucasus
, they preferred and were most used to living in mountainous areas and especially highland plateaux.
[5]
In broad terms, it can be said that the Caucasus Greeks' link with the South Caucasus is a direct consequence of the highland plateaux of the latter being seen and used by the Pontic Greeks as a natural refuge and rallying point whenever North-eastern Anatolia was overrun by Muslim Turks in the Seljuk and Ottoman periods.
[5]
Ancient and medieval history
[
edit
]
Caucasus Greek officer from Mouzarat (now Çakırüzüm köyü),
Ardahan
district, former Russian
south Caucasus
province of
Kars Oblast
Although large numbers of Greeks live in parts of Ukraine and southern Russia, such as
Mariupol
and
Stavropol Krai
, the term Caucasus Greeks strictly speaking should be confined to those Greeks who had settled in the former Russian
Transcaucasus
provinces of
Batum
and
Kars Oblast'
, parts of Georgia such as the region around
Tsalka
, central
Abkhazia
and other localities of the Black Sea Russian Riviera.
Following the Ottoman conquest of the
Empire of Trebizond
in 1461 large numbers of Pontic Greeks left the
Pontic Alps
region as refugees and resettled in parts of the
South Caucasus
, and particularly Georgia. Even the son of King
David of Trebizond
's son George had fled there with his retinue and married a Georgian princess of the
Gurieli
dynasty.
[6]
However, the numbers of these early Pontic Greek refugees to Georgia were in any case probably fairly small, and so although some of the refugees managed to retain their Pontic Greek language and identity, others assimilated through intermarriage into the other Christian communities of the
South Caucasus
region, particularly their fellow Christian Orthodox
Georgians
but also those
Armenians
or
Ossetians
who were Orthodox.
[7]
Early modern period
[
edit
]
To complicate matters further, many so-called "Ottoman Turks" who settled in Georgia and the South Caucasus following
Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign
of the 1570s were actually Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia who had adopted Islam and the Turkish language for official purposes but continued to use Pontic Greek in their daily lives, with one prominent example of an Ottoman Muslim Georgian of Pontic Greek origin being
Resid Mehmed Pasha
. These
Greek Muslims
who adhered to
Islam in Georgia
also either eventually assimilated with the Turkish-speaking Muslim population of southern Georgia usually defined as
Meskhetian Turks
, returned to parts of eastern Anatolia such as Kars following the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, or reverted to their Greek Orthodoxy following the annexation and reintegrated into the Greek Orthodox population of the country.
[8]
Finally, according to available historical evidence we know that thousands of Pontic Greeks from Ottoman north-eastern
Anatolia
and especially the
Gümüşhane
(Greek
Argyroupolis
) region of the
Pontic Alps
are known to have gone to Tsalka in 1763 on being invited by
King Heraclius II
of Georgia to develop silver and lead mining at Akhtala and Alaverdi (in present-day Armenia).
[9]
Many of their descendants survive in Georgia’s
Marneuli
district, although most immigrated to Greece, and particularly
Thessaloniki
(
Salonika
) in
Greek Macedonia
in the mid-1990s.
[10]
It is difficult to verify the numbers of all such waves of Pontic Greeks from the Pontic Alps region to Georgia and the South Caucasus between circa 1520 and 1800, which according to Anthony Bryer is the most obscure period in the history of Pontus and the Pontic Greeks, owing to the scarcity of contemporary Greek and Ottoman Turkish sources on the subject.
[11]
Modern historians suggest that following the Ottoman conquest of 1461, many, if not most Pontic Greeks retreated up into the highlands, where it was easier to maintain their culture and freedom from the encroachments of the Ottoman authorities. This movement was reinforced in the early 1600s by the growing power along the coastal valleys districts of the
derebeys
('valley lords'), which further encouraged Pontic Greeks to retreat away from the coast deeper into the highlands and up onto the eastern Anatolian plateau, before some moved further east into the neighbouring Lesser Caucasus around Kars and southern Georgia.
[12]
Modern historians also suggests that a major migratory movement of Pontic Greeks onto the eastern Anatolian plateau and the Lesser Caucasus occurred in the reign of
Sultan Mehmed IV
(1648-87), during which a common pattern was initiated in Ottoman history: the Ottomans and their clients the
Crimean Tatars
suffered a string of severe defeats at the hands of the expansionist
Russian Empire
and so followed this up with a wave of repression against the Greeks of both the southern Balkans and the Pontic Alps region, on the pretext that Greek statesmen and traders had colluded with the Tsar. As a result, many Pontic Greeks felt pressured into following their cousins who had left Pontus as refugees in previous generations, and so they too decided to migrate to southern Russia or neighbouring Georgia and the South Caucasus.
[13]
However, the largest number of Pontic Greeks from north-eastern Anatolian who settled in Georgia, according to extant historical evidence, were those who fled Ottoman reprisals following the 1768-74 Russo-Turkish war, the
Greek War of Independence
, the 1828-29
Russo-Turkish War
, and the war of 1853-56, which unlike earlier such movements are more widely attested in documentary evidence and traditionally cited by many Pontic Greeks themselves.
[14]
In the war of 1828-29 many north-eastern Anatolia Greeks welcomed, collaborated with, or fought in the Russian Army that occupied
Erzurum
,
Gümüşhane
,
Erzinjan
, and
Kars
(all now in north-eastern Turkey).
[15]
[16]
Most of their descendants settled in Georgia (in areas such as
Tsalka
and
Samtskhe-Javakheti
), the Russian Trans-Caucasus, and other parts of southern Russia. A smaller number of such Pontic Greeks had of course settled in Georgia and the Russian Caucasus well before the Russo-Turkish wars, most notably those belonging to noble and landowning families from the pre-Ottoman
Empire of Trebizond
.
[17]
These included several members of the late
Byzantine
Komnenos
or
Comnenid dynasty
and collateral branches, who often married into princely families from neighbouring Georgia, including those of the
Bagrationi
and especially the
Gurieli
and
Andronikashvili
.
[18]
Among those who remained in the
Pontic Alps
and north-eastern
Anatolia
some led local revolts against the Ottomans, while many others actually intermarried into the Ottoman ruling elite, thereby converting to Islam and joining the Turkish millet.
[19]
Several Ottoman-era sources tell us, however, that even among
Pontic Greeks
belonging to local noble families - such as those of
Gavras
,
Doukas
and the
Komnenoi
- who had
turned Turk
, many remained
Crypto-Christian
(in north-eastern Anatolia often referred to as
Stavriotes
), openly renouncing Islam and taking up arms against Ottoman troops based around
Gümüşhane
and
Erzinjan
during the Russo-Turkish wars, before following the Russian army back into Georgia and southern Russia.
[20]
It was some of these
Pontic Greek
community leaders that claimed noble lineages extending back to the
Empire of Trebizond
who subsequently became officers in the Russian Imperial army, as many Armenian and Georgian princes such as
Ivane Andronikashvili
had previously done.
[21]
These Caucasus Greek officers, whether of noble Byzantine or more humble Pontic Greek origin, played a significant role in the 1877 Russian conquest of
Kars
and
Ardahan
, where many of them settled with their families and other displaced Greeks from northeast Anatolia and Georgia (the latter themselves the descendants of pre-1877 Greek refugees and exiles from northeast Anatolia now re-settled in Kars by the Russian Imperial government).
[22]

Language
[
edit
]
A large number of Caucasus Greeks who settled in Georgia became referred to as
Urum
(from the Turkish for '[Byzantine] Romans') and spoke a Turkish dialect with a large admixture of Pontic Greek, Georgian, and Armenian vocabulary.
[23]
According to local Greek legend, after the suppression of their revolt against Ottoman rule, these Turkish-speaking but Christian Orthodox Caucasus Greeks had been given the choice by Sultan
Selim I
either to accept Islam but continue to use their Greek mother tongue, or to use the Turkish language but retain their Christian Orthodox faith.
[24]
Selim I had been based in the
Trebizond
region before he became Sultan in 1512, since he was himself of partly
Pontic Greek
origin on the side of his mother
Gülbahar Hatun
.
[25]
[26]
Nevertheless, most Caucasus Greeks had never had to face this predicament of having to choose between their Christian Orthodox faith and their
Pontic Greek language
and so were able to retain both, although when in Russian territory they eventually came to adopt Russian as their second language for public and educational purposes.
[27]
Caucasus Greeks also often maintained some command of Turkish as more or less a third language, thanks to their own roots in north-eastern Anatolia, where they had after all lived (usually very uneasily and in a state of intermittent warfare) alongside Turkish-speaking Muslims since the Seljuk-backed Turkish migrations into 'the lands of Rum' or Anatolia during the 11th and 12th centuries.
[28]
Pontic Greeks in Georgia and the Russian Caucasus also maintained this command of Turkish so as to communicate with their Muslim neighbours living in the region, most of whom used Turkish as a
lingua franca
or even adopted it as their first language irrespective of actual ethnic origin.
[29]
This situation is in stark contrast to that of the
Greek Muslims
of western
Greek Macedonia
called
Vallahades
and the
Cretan Muslims
, both of whom generally remained ignorant of Turkish, continued to use Greek as their first language, and retained Greek culture and traditions long after converting to Islam in the middle Ottoman period. Of course, while many Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks had also adopted Islam as early as the 1500s or before, these "new Turks" generally either adopted Turkish and then assimilated into the Turkish-speaking Muslim Ottoman population or they remained Crypto-Christian and then openly reverted to their Christian Orthodoxy on the occasion of the 1828 Russian occupation of northeastern Anatolia or after the passing of the
Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856
.
[30]
Russian siege of Kars, 1828
It should be stressed, then, that the vast majority of these eastern Pontic Greeks who had settled in southern Russia, Georgia, and the Trans-Caucasus region but preserved their distinct Greek identity were mainly the descendants of the Greeks who left the Pontic Alps and the northeast Anatolian highland region after the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768-74 and 1828-29.
[1]
Contrary to certain popular myths, these Pontic Greek settlers therefore had absolutely nothing to do with those Greeks who had settled in the South Caucasus region in the Hellenistic or Classical Greek period, although they generally did merge with those somewhat smaller Pontic Greek communities who had settled in Georgia, Armenia, and the South Caucasus in general in the late Byzantine and early Ottoman period.
[31]
The main reason Caucasus Greeks preferred to identify themselves exclusively with the later, particularly 19th century waves of Pontic Greek refugees to the South Caucssus rather than also with ancestors who had already settled in the region in the late Byzantine or early Ottoman period is probably because this helped in the presentation of their history as being linked for a longer period to the territories ruled by the
Empire of Trebizond
, that is
Pontus
proper, and also helped minimize the historically inconvenient evidence of both substantial non-Greek influences on their culture and extensive intermarriage with the indigenous, non-Hellenic races of the South Caucasus region.
[32]
According to conservative estimates these eastern Pontic Greeks who collaborated with and/or followed the Russian army into Georgia and southern Russia following the 1828 Russian occupation of
Erzurum
and
Gümüşhane
had made up around 20% of the entire Greek population of the eastern Black Sea coastline and the Pontic Alps that formed its mountain hinterland.
[33]
They were subsequently resettled by the Russian Imperial government in the Ukraine and other parts of southern Russia, but also especially
Georgia
and (after 1878) Kars Oblast.
[34]
Like those Pontic Greeks who fought for Russia in the 1768-74 Russo-Turkish war, most male Greeks who settled in Russian territory following the 1828-29 war continued to serve in the Russian Imperial army, often bearing their own community's hopes to re-capture more Christian Greek territory from the Muslim Turks on the back of the Russian Empire. Like Georgians, Armenians, and other peoples from the South Caucasus, many Caucasus Greek men fought and lost their lives through service in the Russian army not just in wars against the Ottomans, but also in other campaigns, such as the 1817-1864
Caucasian War
, in which Russia sought to impose its rule over the Muslim mountain tribes of the
north Caucasus
.
[35]
Role in Russian conquests
[
edit
]
The
1877-78 Russo-Turkish War
and the
Treaty of San Stefano
and
Treaty of Berlin
that brought it to a close led to the Russian Empire making permanent gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire in north-eastern Anatolia.
[36]
These centred around the fortified city of Kars in historical northern Armenia, which Russia now administered as
Kars Oblast
, i.e. the militarily administered province of Kars, which also included the towns and districts of
Ardahan
and
Sarikamish
. As in the 1828-29 war, many Greeks of north-eastern Anatolia and Pontus fought in or collaborated with the Imperial Russian Army in the 1877-78 war against the Ottomans, often serving as soldiers and officers in an army that included large numbers of Georgians, Armenians, Ossetians and Cossack, as well as Russians proper - the Georgians and Armenians in particular being represented among the senior ranks.
[7]
Although the Ottoman province or 'vilayet' of Kars already had several Greek villages dating back to 1830 or sometimes even earlier, most of these later pro-Russian Greeks of north-eastern Ottoman Anatolia settled in Kars province after it was incorporated into the Russian empire in 1878.
[37]
It was precisely because most of the Greek settlers in Kars Oblast had entered the region with the Russians from the direction of Georgia, that contemporaries - and academics later on - came to define them as
Caucasus Greeks
or
Russianized Pontic Greeks
, in contrast to those Greek who had never left Ottoman-ruled North-eastern Anatolia. Even in Russian occupied Georgia, however, these Greeks had generally lived in the southern areas of the country which - like the Kars-Ardahan region - were part of the Lesser Caucasus highland plateau, rather than among the deep valleys and jagged mountain peaks of the High Caucasus range in northern Georgia. In terms of population, the areas in both Georgia and Kars province inhabited by the Caucasus Greeks tended to be those that also had large concentrations of Armenian population - one well-known product of this Greek-Armenian mix being the famous mystic and theosophist
George Gurdjieff
. Another well known, although more recent Caucasus Greek with roots in these areas but born in
Tbilisi
was
Yanis Kanidis
, a Russian PE instructor and hero of the
Beslan school hostage crisis
in
North Ossetia
. These same areas now in Georgia also had various pockets of Muslims of Turkish and non-Turkish (convert) ethnic origin - though the latter had generally become Turkish in speech and culture.
[38]
Pontic Greek leaders from Georgia
The Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast were mainly concentrated in around 77 towns and villages as part of official Russian government policy to people a traditionally
Turkish
,
Kurdish
,
Georgian
-Muslim (here often called
Chveneburi
) and
Laz
-Muslim or Christian but generally non-Orthodox Armenian area with a staunchly pro-Russian Christian Orthodox community.
[39]
In general they were settled on grassy highland plateaux, such as the Gole/Kiolias plateau of present-day Ardahan province, since these resembled their original lands in the Pontic Alps and later ones they had settled on in Georgia. In towns like Kars, Ardahan, and Sarikamish ethnic Greeks constituted only a small minority (10-15%) of the inhabitants, most of whom were Christian Armenians, Kurdish Muslims, or smaller numbers of Orthodox Georgians, while even many of the mainly ethnic Greek villages still included small numbers of Armenians (including Greek Orthodox Armenians), Georgians, and even Kurds, employed by the Greeks to look after the sheep, cattle, and horses.
[40]
The Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast were generally reasonably well educated, every village having its own school, although most were involved in farming, horse breeding, or mining for their livelihoods. A smaller but still significant number did, however, work outside the agricultural and mining sectors. In particular, many pursued careers as regular soldiers and officers in the Russian Imperial Army, in the regional police force,  as clergymen, or even within the provincial Russian administration. Unlike the Pontic Greeks of the Black Sea coastal cities like Trebizond, however, very few Caucasus Greeks were involved in trade.
[41]
Mount
Falakro
, Drama Prefecture, eastern
Greek Macedonia
, where many Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks resettled
Caucasus Greeks were often multilingual, able to speak, read, and write Greek and Russian and speak Eastern Anatolian Turkish, and sometimes also basic Georgian and Armenian.
[42]
Although their native language was Greek, generally only the most highly educated - such as scholars, lawyers, members of the Orthodox clergy educated in Russian universities, and other community leaders claiming noble or royal lineage extending back to the
Empire of Trebizond
- had more than an intermediate-level knowledge of formal
Demotic Greek
and the more classicizing
Katharevousa
of the late Byzantine period.
[43]
The majority were restricted to their own variant of Pontic Greek, which had a somewhat larger admixture of Turkish, Georgian, Russian, and Armenian vocabulary than the colloquial form of Greek used in Pontus proper.
[44]
However, the Caucasus Greeks had had to become fluent Russian speakers, as a result of the schooling and education policies implemented by the Russian Imperial government, although at home and amongst themselves they continued to favour Greek.
[45]
But Caucasus Greeks were still often conflated or confused with Russians in Kars Oblast because of their use of Russian and worship alongside Russians in the same Orthodox churches as well as their generally Russianized and pro-Russian empire outlook. In fact, one quite popular but stereotyped way local 'Turks' might differentiate Caucasus Greeks from other Pontic Greeks was by stating that the former were "Greeks who had taken the Borshch [soup] from the Russians"!
[46]
The Caucasus Greeks had close social links with the Greek Orthodox Russian settlers of Kars Oblast through worshiping in each other's churches as well as marrying partners of Russian Caucasus origin. These links were closer than those with either non-Orthodox Armenians or Orthodox Georgians, primarily because most of the former were not in communion with the
Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople
while many of the latter were becoming increasingly attracted to Georgian nationalism. However, contacts and intermarriage between Caucasus Greeks and Armenians who were members of the Greek Orthodox church was fairly common, and to a lesser extent also existed between Caucasus Greeks and other Greek Orthodox communities of the South Caucasus, such as
Georgians
or
Ossetians
.
[47]
Since many of the Turkish, Kurdish, and Indigenous Laz-speaking Muslims from the Kars region had fled westwards into Ottoman territory during and after the 1877-78 war, many other non-Orthodox Christian communities were also resettled there by the Russian administration.
[48]
These included Russian religious minorities considered "heretical" by the Russian Orthodox Church, such as
Dukhobors
and
Molokans
, who as pacifists did not perform Russian military service and so unlike the Caucasus Greeks, Georgians, and Armenians did not play a significant role in the wars against the Ottomans. Even smaller numbers of
Caucasus Germans
,
Estonians
,
Poles
, and
Lithuanians
, were settled in Kars Oblast, despite none of these communities having any significant historic or cultural links with the
Transcaucasus
and
Eastern Anatolia
, in contrast to the long-standing links Pontic Greeks had always had with the region.
[49]
Contemporary (post-World War I)
[
edit
]
During
World War I
most able-bodied Caucasus Greek men again fought for Russia against the Ottoman Empire, usually serving in the
Russian Caucasus Army
, which was led by a coterie of senior Russian, Georgian, and Armenian officers. In the final stages of the war, a
Greek Caucasus Division
was even established by bringing together Caucasus Greeks from different regiments of the Russian army in the South Caucasus, and whose primary purpose was to help defend ethnic Greek villages in the Kars, Erzerum, and Erzincan regions.
Most Caucasus Greeks left Kars Oblast following the cession of the area back to the Ottoman Empire in 1917, but before the official population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922-23.
[50]
They mainly settled in villages in
Greek Macedonia
previously inhabited by Ottoman Muslims, and again generally preferred those situated on grassy plateaux or mountain districts, since these most closely resembled their former home in the South Caucasus. However, like many other Greeks of
Pontus
and north-eastern Anatolia, significant numbers of Caucasus Greeks who wanted to remain in what was now Turkish territory at any cost chose to convert to Islam and adopt the Turkish language for public purposes so as to be exempted from the population exchange.
[51]
According to the terms of the population exchange protocol (which was essentially an appendage to the
Treaty of Lausanne
) the categories 'Greek' and 'Turk' were defined by religious affiliation rather than ethnicity, resulting in large numbers of
Greek Muslims
from Macedonia and Crete being categorized as 'Turkish in soul' and so resettled in the Turkish Aegean and parts of Anatolia.
[52]
Those Caucasus Greeks who had remained in north-eastern Anatolia, like the many other Pontic Greeks who had also converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language, subsequently became assimilated into the wider Turkish-Muslim population of the provinces of Trabzon, Sivas, Erzurum, Erzinjan, Kars, and Ardahan.
[53]
However, after 1917 many Caucasus Greeks from Kars Oblast, and in particular those who had close Russian family links through intermarriage, also resettled in parts of Southern Russia that already had pre-existing communities of Pontic Greeks descended from earlier waves of refugees from northeastern Anatolia. These Greeks were based mainly in
Stavropol Krai
, in the foothills of the
North Caucasus
, where they still make up a significant element of the population (often up to 10%) in both urban and rural areas. They became fully assimilated into modern Russian life and society, although following the dissolution of the Soviet Union they substantially increased their links with Greece - and particularly with northern Greece - through work, trade, or study in their "mother" country and through taking up Greek nationality alongside their Russian one.
[54]
Caucasus Greeks in contemporary Greek Macedonia
[
edit
]
Most of the Caucasus Greeks of Kars Oblast who had not sided with the Bolsheviks subsequently left for Greece in 1919, before the province was officially re-incorporated into the territory of the new
Turkish Republic
and the large-scale Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1922-23.
[55]
Most were resettled in
Kilkis
province and other parts of central and eastern
Greek Macedonia
, particularly in villages of the mountainous
Drama prefecture
that until 1922 had been inhabited largely by "Turks" (in this case Ottoman Muslims of mainly Bulgarian and Greek Macedonian convert origin).
[56]
During the German occupation of Greece (1940-44) and
Greek Civil War
of 1943-49 most Caucasus Greek men fought for
ELAS
, the military wing of
EAM
, the leading Greek communist guerrilla organisation that fought against the German occupation.
[57]
Many in Greece argue that the strong communist affiliations of Greek Macedonia's Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks, most of whom even today continue to support the Greek Communist Party
KKE
, has never had anything to do with ideology but was actually due to residual pro-Russian sentiment and traditional family expectations, despite the fact that many had grandparents who had not remained in Russian territory precisely because they had not sided with the Bolsheviks.
The communist affiliations of most Caucasus Greeks has also been cited to account for why they often play down or even conceal any previous involvement their ancestors may have had in the Tsarist army or administration during the Russian occupation of the Transcaucasus region.
[58]
For those communist Caucasus Greeks who, following the 1946-49
Greek Civil War
, settled as refugees in the
Eastern Bloc
, particularly the
USSR
and
Czechoslovakia
, playing down or concealing their community's previous links with the
Russian Empire
was an essential tactic to ensure a safe, secure, and flourishing life in a communist state and society. One example of a high ranking Caucasus Greek from Kars Oblast who spent much of his life fighting and propagandizing against Soviet communism, after having fought against the
Bolsheviks
with the forces of the
White movement
, was
Constantine Kromiadi
.
Caucasus Greeks have generally assimilated well into modern Greek society, being successful within a broad range of trades and professions. They are generally conflated by other Greeks with the Pontic Greeks of Pontus proper, whom many in Greece see as very socially conservative, clan-like, and inward-looking. Otherwise, Caucasus Greeks are often inaccurately described by other Greeks as 'Russo-Pontic [Greeks]' and sometimes even confused with the many ethnic Greeks who came from Georgia and southern Russia in the mid-90s, particularly since they often live in the same parts of Thessaloniki, share a similar Pontic Greek dialect, and tend to have surnames ending in '-dis' (from the Ancient Greek for 'the sons of ... ').
[59]
However, it is generally the ethnic Greeks who came to Greek Macedonia from Georgia and southern Russia in the mid-1990s rather than the Caucasus Greeks who came shortly after 1919 that other Greeks often accuse of among other things being involved in organised crime in northern Greece and the wider Balkans and creating a kind of parallel, underground society.
The Caucasus Greeks and Pontic Greeks in general who settled in northern Greece between 1919 and 1923 have, on the other hand, had a lot more time to assimilate into contemporary Greek society than the more recent arrivals from Georgia and southern Russia, and as a consequence have a far better command of standard Modern Greek and awareness of mainstream Greek culture.
[60]
The Caucasus Greeks and Pontic Greeks of Greek Macedonia have still managed to preserve some of their unique traditions and have also established many cultural and civil society organisations.  The aspect of Pontic Greek culture most apparent to the outside observer is their traditional food, costume, music, and dance, with those of the Caucasus Greeks reflecting heavier Russian, Georgian, and Armenian influences. For example, the traditional costume of Caucasus Greek women resembles that of southern Russian women, while the men's costume is light grey, in contrast to the black attire worn by Greek men from Pontus proper, which they share with the Muslim Laz of the eastern Pontic Alps.
[61]
List of settlements in the Russian Transcaucasus with a sizeable population of Greeks
[
edit
]
Although precise figures are difficult to verify, it is likely a total of around 56,350 Greeks lived within Kars Oblast until 1919. The following is a list of the towns and villages in which they lived, given in both Greek and English transliteration. The names of the vast majority of these settlements are evidently of Turkish or Armenian origin in
Kars Oblast’
, of Georgian origin in
Batum Oblast
and even many majority-Greek settlements were also inhabited by Christians from other ethnic groups, particularly Orthodox Georgians, Orthodox and/or Gregorian Armenians, and Orthodox and/or “Sectarian” Russians.

This is a list of all verifiable organizations that claim to be a Masonic Grand Lodge in United States.
A Masonic "
Grand Lodge
" (or sometimes "Grand Orient") is the governing body that supervises the individual "
Lodges of Freemasons
" in a particular geographical area, known as its "jurisdiction" (usually corresponding to a sovereign state or other major geopolitical unit). Some are large, with thousands of members divided into hundreds of subordinate lodges, while others are tiny, with only a few members split between a handful of local lodges. Sometimes there will only be one Grand Lodge in a given area, but the majority of the time there will be at least two. More often, there will be several competing Grand Lodges claiming the same jurisdictional area, or claiming overlapping areas. This fact leads to debates over legitimacy: Not all Grand Lodges and Grand Orients recognize each other as being legitimate. However, such recognition is not relevant to this list, yet recognition is foundational within the fraternal order. Inclusion in this list only requires the establishment of a physical (as opposed to a virtual, or online) presence, and lodges (regular, unrecognized or clandestine) which acknowledge their governance.
Membership numbers are subject to change; for current figures, check the sources which are indicated in the reference section.

The
Allmusic
review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating "Blake's sense of restraint, even in the most deliberate of his improvised readings such as on Lewis Allan's "Strange Fruit," Quincy Jones' theme from The Pawnbroker, Milton Nascimento's "Cançao do Sol," and even Gershwin's "I Loves You, Porgy," offers such distinctive readings of these tunes rhythmically, harmonically, and lyrically that it's difficult after a while to see where the body of the original composition ends and Blake begins".
[3]
On
All About Jazz
Henry Smith noted "Blake's noir-like approach to the piano, with his open sense of harmony and time as well as the deep and beautiful melancholy which ingrains his playing, is present on all of the pieces here. Never once does a cliche emerge from his fingers as he infuses these works with a personal and carefully chosen character all his own".
[4]
PopMatters
reviewer Steve Horowitz said "On the whole, the album is soft and lovely and begs to be heard when one seeks the quiet of solitude"
[5]
The
JazzTimes
review by Thomas Conrad felt "If you have read about Ran Blake but do not know his music,
Driftwoods
is a good place to discover him".

B.U.M. Equipment
Product type
Clothing brand
Owner
BUM Equipment LLC
Country
Los Angeles, CA
Introduced
1986
Website
B.U.M. Equipment
, a clothing brand under the ownership of BUM Equipment LLC, is a
street fashion
clothing company that was founded in 1986 in a
Seattle
garage.
[1]
The brand is known for its beginning as a
Los Angeles
casual
sportswear
brand for men, women, and children.
[2]
The brand had financial troubles in the mid-1990s under the management of the original owner, Chauvin International, Ltd.
[3]
It went bankrupt in 1996 and was acquired by the creditors of B.U.M. International Inc. and managed by SOS Management in 1997.
[1]
[4]
SOS Management, and its successor B.U.M. Equipment LLC, subsequently relaunched B.U.M. Equipment.
[4]
The brand's fashion lines include men's, women's, junior's, and children's sportswear apparel, as well as hosiery, footwear, backpacks, handbags, luggage, and eyewear.
[1]
According to the
LA Times
, B.U.M. Equipment is "one of the most successful young men's sportswear brands in California fashion history."
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Origins (1986-1996)
[
edit
]
Chauvin International, Ltd., a manufacturing company that was led by Morty Forshpan, acquired B.U.M. in 1986.
[3]
The clothing line made its market debut in 1987 and featured basic clothing items with the brand's logo displayed across their T-shirts, tanks, and sweatshirts.
[5]
Within its first year, B.U.M. Equipment grossed $2 million and it brought in about $240 million in annual revenues by 1992.
[5]
In 1992, the B.U.M. parent company, Chauvin International, partnered with the Canadian casual wear company
Chip and Pepper
. Chauvin International purchased the assets of the Chip and Pepper Wetwear Inc., and distributed its products in the United States while the twin co-founders,
Chip and Pepper
Foster, were still in charge of overseeing the design along with the marketing and promotion. In 1994 Chauvin International, Ltd. merged with Cami'z, Inc., the B.U.M. brand's retailer.
[6]
In April 1996, B.U.M. International filed for
Chapter 11
bankruptcy due to what the company said was poor sales.
[7]
The judge allowed reorganization plan by SOS Management in favor of the B.U.M. International Inc. creditors in 1997.
[8]
The reorganization, managed by SOS Management and its successor BUM Equipment LLC, resulted in a plan that was in which the B.U.M. International creditors would be paid in full in five years.
[9]
After the five year payback period, the B.U.M. International Inc. operating unit was dissolved.
[9]
The
trademarks
were purchased by BUM Equipment LLC
[9]
and has continued to operate under that corporate structure.
Relaunch and B.U.M. Equipment LLC, (1997-present)
[
edit
]
SOS Management was established in 1996 by
Chairman
and
chief executive officer
Stephen Wayne and
Vice Chairman
Steve Marra.
[1]
Wayne was the president of Yves Saint Laurent Sportswear (1974-77), president of the menswear division of
Calvin Klein
(1977-81), and the president of Sasson Industries for five years prior to launching his own licensing firm, Stephen Wayne & Associates,
[10]
in 1986.
[1]
Wayne was the exclusive licensing agent for Sasson,
Bugle Boy
,
Andrew Fezza
and Bum Equipment and owns and operates the Stephen Wayne & Associates company.
[1]
[11]
Prior to co-founding SOS Management, Steve Marra worked for
Macy's
for sixteen years, most recently as vice president of merchandising, and later worked as president of B.U.M. Equipment's retail division and executive vice president of sales and merchandising for the company.
[1]
B.U.M. Equipment emerged from bankruptcy in 1997 under the management of SOS Management headed by Wayne and Marra.
[4]
In 2002, SOS Management purchased the B.U.M. Equipment trademark, establishing the new trademark and licensing company called BUM Equipment LLC.
[9]
By 2005, B.U.M was operating more than 20 licenses around the world and gathering approximately $600 million annually.
[12]
Brand development
[
edit
]
B.U.M. Equipment's logo and athletic style were created by Seattle native Derek Federman about a year prior to Morty Forshpan becoming the chief executive officer (CEO) of Chauvin International, Ltd.
[2]
Shortly after becoming the CEO of Chauvin International, Forshpan found the B.U.M. brand and acquired it.
[2]
Forshpan pushed the brand into the market in 1987.
[2]
Brand founder Federman left B.U.M. in 1988 as Forshpan moved the brand's design in a more trendy direction, and following its success and popularity in the late 1980s, Forshpan was nominated twice for the California Mart's West Coast Designer of the Year award.
[2]
Chauvin International and B.U.M. brand designers insist the acronym "B.U.M." does not stand for anything, however, many people believed there was an unsaid meaning like "Basic Urban Merchandise" or "Body Under Maintenance".
[5]
Under SOS Management and Bum Equipment LLC, Wayne signed over 35 licenses in 1997 and 1998, which grew the business approximately $2 billion in sales over the next six years.
[1]
This was accomplished by primarily selling product to Target Stores
[13]
and many regional retailers like Ames, Caldor, Venture, Meijers, Shopko.
[9]
SOS Management began restructuring B.U.M. sportswear in the United States with a license with the Buffalo Group in 2005.
[14]
The company also signed licensees in
Malaysia
,
Taiwan
,
England
,
Korea
,
Germany
,
Mexico
,
Argentina
and
Brazil
. The B.U.M. brand was extended to non-apparel licenses in footwear, socks, sunglasses, and licenses in watches, luggage and eyewear were renewed.
[1]
B.U.M. Equipment signed licenses with New York-based Channel Creations in 2007 for their men's and women's sportswear.
[12]
In 2009, the company relaunched their young men's and juniors brands in department stores through a license with Sierra Fashions.
[15]
In 2004,
Women's Wear Daily
listed B.U.M. Equipment as Number 5 on their "Top 10 Young Contemporary Hip List in 2004."
[16]

Religious Confession of Christians in the fourth century in Syria and Scythia
Audianism
, or
Anthropomorphism
, was a sect of Christians in the 4th century in
Syria
and
Scythia
, named after their founder Audius (or Audaeus
[1]
), who interpreted the text of I Timothy 3:16 literally, to mean that God created mankind in His own image.
Beliefs
[
edit
]
The distinguishing beliefs and practices included both
theological anthropomorphism
and
quartodecimanism
.
Anthropomorphism holds that God has human form. Audius took the text of
Genesis
1:27 literally and held that God created humans to resemble His physical form.
[2]
Quartodecimans honoured the death of
Christ
on the eve of the
Jewish
Passover
, instead of following the Roman tradition of celebrating
Easter
on a
Sunday
.
History
[
edit
]
Audius lived in Syria in the 4th century. His views extended into
Scythia
. Towards the end of the 4th century, the opinion of the Audians appeared among some African Christians.
[2]
One Syrian village, Jubb'addin's, name (in
Aramaic
) means "the well of Audius."
[
citation needed
]
In 325 at the
First Council of Nicaea
, it was decreed that all Christians should follow the Roman tradition of celebrating Pascha (Easter) on
Easter
Sunday, and no longer on the date of 14
Nisan
(the Jewish
Passover
), as the so-called
Quartodecimans
used to do.
[3]
The Audians, however, continued the Quartodeciman practice.
Epiphanius of Salamis
called attention to the Audians (as well as other sects he considered heretical) in his
Panarion
. Although Epiphanius is not always a trustworthy source, he correctly quotes the viewpoint of the Audians,
[4]
that the church had "abandoned the fathers' Paschal rite in Constantine's time from deference to the emperor, and changed the day to suit the emperor".
[5]
Roman Emperors
Constantine I the Great
and
Theodosius I
legislated against the Audians, but the sect was still practicing quartodecimanism in Syrian
Antioch
in the 380s.
The
Church Father
Theodoret
wrote on the belief the following, as Chapter IX of his
Ecclesiastical History
(Book IV), titled "Of the heresy of the Audiani":
The illustrious emperor thus took heed of the apostolic decrees, but Audaeus, a Syrian alike in race and in speech, appeared at that time as an inventor of new decrees. He had long ago begun to incubate iniquities and now appeared in his true character. At first he understood in an absurd sense the passage "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." From want of apprehension of the meaning of the divine Scripture he understood the Divine Being to have a human form, and conjectured it to be enveloped in bodily parts; for Holy Scripture frequently describes the divine operations under the names of human parts, since by these means the providence of God is made more easily intelligible to minds incapable of perceiving any immaterial ideas. To this impiety Audaeus added others of a similar kind. By an eclectic process he adopted some of the
Manichean
doctrines of
Manes
and denied that the God of the universe is creator of either fire or darkness. But these and all similar errors are concealed by the adherents of his faction.
They allege that they are separated from the assemblies of the Church. But since some of them exact a cursed usury, and some live unlawfully with women without the bond of wedlock, while those who are innocent of these practices live in free fellowship with the guilty, they hide the
blasphemy
of their doctrines by accounting as they do for their living by themselves. The plea is however an impudent one, and the natural result of Pharisaic teaching, for the
Pharisees
accused the Physician of souls and bodies in their question to the holy Apostles "How is it that your Master eateth with publicans and sinners?" and through the prophet, God of such men says "Which say, 'come not near me for I am pure' this is smoke of my wrath." But this is not a tithe to refute their unreasonable error. I therefore pass on to the remainder of my narrative.
[6]
Other Church Fathers who wrote against it included
Jerome
[7]
and
Cyril of Alexandria
, who encountered it among some Egyptian monks. Cyril composed a short refutation of their error, which he attributed to extreme ignorance.
[8]
Anthropomorphism
[
edit
]
Other early Christian writers such as
Melito of Sardis
,
Tertullian
,
Origen
and
Lactantius
were also accused of anthropomorphism.
[2]
Anthropomorphism was revived in northern Italy during the 10th century but was effectually suppressed by the bishops, notably by
Ratherius
, bishop of
Verona
.
[2]
In modern times,
Benny Hinn
has also been accused of teaching a form of anthropomorphism.
[9]
Academic knowledge
[
edit
]
In reality, very little is known about Audians.
[10]
It is not known whether Audians were
Quartodecimans
or just protopaschites.
[11]
Their anthropomorphism was "metaphorical", i.e. centered upon a purely mental image, and not upon a physically concrete representation of God.

Don't Scare the Hare
is a 2011 British television
game show
produced by Initial (a
subsidiary
of
Endemol UK
) for the BBC, hosted by
Jason Bradbury
and narrated by
Sue Perkins
. The programme was aired on
BBC One
on Saturday evenings and was first transmitted on 23 April 2011. This series had been planned to run for nine episodes
[2]
but it was taken off air after six episodes because of poor ratings. The remaining three episodes were rescheduled for broadcast in October 2011.
[3]
In the show, contestants must compete in a series of challenges to win £15,000 of prize money; failure to complete questions and physical challenges risks "scaring" a giant robotic hare.
[4]
The programme has been described by its host as "fantasy based toddler telly with an adult twist".
[5]
It was the first show to be made at
Dock10
,
MediaCityUK
.
[6]
Background
[
edit
]
The show was piloted at BBC Television Centre in September 2009, with Jason Bradbury as host and
Barry Davies
providing a live voiceover.
[7]
The format underwent further development. In November 2010, the
Manchester Evening News
reported that television production company
Endemol
was producing a new game show for Saturday evenings at the area's new
dock10
studios.
[8]
In December,
The Guardian
reported that a giant robotic hare had been seen at the complex in Salford.
[9]
Jason Bradbury was named as host in January 2011, while some newspapers identified comedian
Miranda Hart
as the show's narrator.
[10]
[11]
However, the role went to Sue Perkins.
Announcing
Don't Scare the Hare
, BBC Entertainment's executive editor Alan Tyler said the show "cleverly captures the spirit and fun of interactive family video games that has been sweeping the nation. [...] We're excited about bringing this experimental new format to early Saturday evenings on BBC One", while Nick Mather, head of entertainment at Endemol called the show "an innovative new format and said he was "highly excited to be making this large scale studio show for BBC One."
[10]
Overview
[
edit
]
The programme was presented by
Jason Bradbury
, who explained to the viewers that he lives in an underground forest with his "mate" the Hare (a giant robotic hare on wheels). He invited the contestants to "do a whole bunch of crazy stuff" (play a few games), but there was one important rule: They must not scare the Hare.
The main part of the show involved two teams of contestants playing three rounds against each other, each round involving a physical challenge. Sometimes these tasks involved a puzzle or memory element which one member of each team must complete. For example, in the first episode the games involved hopping around in sleeping bags to stop alarm clocks from going off, remembering a sequence of lights and using them to "cross" a pond of lilypads, and hooking carrots with fishing rods. A wrong move on any of the tasks would set off a loud noise, "scaring" the Hare, which ran around the studio squeaking and rolling its eyes. Three of these forfeits would lose the contestant that particular round. Noises include ringing alarm clocks and croaking frogs. These games are narrated by Sue Perkins, who is styled as "The Voice of the Forest".
Points were awarded in the form of giant plastic carrots. Completing each of the first two rounds would earn the team three carrots, while the third round was a head-to-head where several points were on offer. Generally this involved a member of each team collecting up to 18 carrots from the Hare's allotment.
The winning team went through to the final round, where they had a chance to play for £15,000. This involved the team members answering a series of multiple choice questions, with each contestant in charge of a plunger which corresponded to an A, B, or C answer. They had to answer three questions correctly, each correct answer allowing the Hare to advance along a course which would eventually trap him. The first correct answer let the Hare into the garden by opening a gate, the second raised a net and the third trapped the Hare, winning the team £15,000. Incorrect answers detonated dynamite; three explosions meant that the team walked away with nothing.
Games
[
edit
]
Alarm-a-geddon
: One player from each team had to turn off alarm clocks, which turned themselves on, until the sun rises. If three alarm clocks went off, the Hare was scared and the team won nothing. If the sun rose before Hare was scared, the team won three carrots.
Allotment Impossible
: One player was suspended above Hare's allotment in a harness and had to then collect up to 18 carrots from "electrified" boxes using prongs. Touching the sides of the box forfeited the carrots which had to be returned to Hare's bin. Extracted carrots could be placed in a team's basket.
Bangers and Smash
: A member of each team had to throw apples at a series of fireworks, toppling them before the fuse burns down. If they failed to dislodge the firework before the fuse expires, it exploded frightening the Hare.
Cash and Carrots
: In this final round, qualified teams had to answer three general knowledge questions correctly. The first correct answer let Hare into the garden by opening a gate. The second raised a net and the third trapped Hare, winning the team £15,000. Incorrect answers detonated dynamite - three incorrect mean that teams walked away with nothing.
Hot Hare Balloons
: In this final qualifying round, up to 18 carrots were available. One player sat in a chair suspended by balloons above the Hare's allotment. The player had to take the carrots from the allotment using long hooks, whilst avoiding motion sensitive lasers, putting it in the bin next to their chair. If the lasers were activated, an alarm went off, and the carrots had to be forfeited to Hare's bin.
Party Poppers
: It was Hare's birthday, and his party was missing balloons. One contestant from each team had to maneuver a balloon through a thorn bush without popping it and deliver it to Hare's party. One balloon safe was enough to win three carrots. However, popping all (three) balloons in the thorn bush meant the game was lost.
Pond Memories
: One player from each team had to memorise a sequence of lily pads, which lit up. If they made a mistake, a frog chorus went off, scaring Hare. If the contestant got across all the lily pads without scaring Hare three times, they won three carrots.
Running Yolk
: One player from each team had to transport three eggs across a farm yard obstacle course, first from the chicken coop, through a gate and over some rollers, over a hay bale, over spinning stepping stones and onto egg cups before the bread in a toaster rose. Each new egg was larger in size than the last. Each broken egg scared Hare once - three scares and no carrots. Three eggs and the team won three carrots.
Vase Attacks
: One player from each team had to transport three paintings to hooks on the other side of the room before the time ran out. Each painting was larger than the last. However, in between them and the hooks were fragile vases. Each vase broken scared Hare once - three scares and the player got nothing. Three carrots could be won if all three paintings were hung without scaring Hare or running out of time.
What's Up Shock
: In this final qualifying round, one player from each team had to attempt to take up to 18 carrots from Hare's allotment by taking them from electrified wires. If the ring attached to the carrots hit the wire, the carrots must be forfeited to Hare's bin. Carrots that were won could be deposited in a team's basket.
Reception
[
edit
]
The first episode received overnight ratings of 1.93 million viewers, a 15% audience share.
[12]
Although hot weather was given as a possible reason for the low ratings, it was reported that many viewers were unimpressed with the show, assuming it was a one-off to tie in with Easter (since the tagline used to promote the show was "this year, the
Easter bunny
has competition"), and were surprised to learn that more episodes were scheduled to be broadcast. Justin Mason, critic for ATV, said, "I don't think I've quite seen anything like
Don't Scare the Hare
. I was wondering who on earth dreamt up the idea... it looked like a cheap, children's quiz-show that would be better placed on
CBeebies
than prime-time BBC One."
[13]
Jim Shelley
of the
Daily Mirror
was equally as critical, summing up his review as follows: "The idiots playing might have enjoyed themselves but even toddlers would have found the games dull and Jason creepy."
[14]
A review in
The Stage
observed: "The actual games are pretty feeble and uninspired, leaving the poor hare and his robotic novelty value to carry the show. Unfortunately, the hare is far from impressive either. Doctor Who's tin dog
K9
managed more personality and manoeuvrability, and he was operating within the confines of seventies technology."
[4]
John Anson of the
Lancashire Evening Post
opined: "If you’re going to have a gimmick in your game show at least make it entertaining. Surely this is a programme which would have been ideal for CBeebies. Make the questions simple, involve bunches of kids and hey, presto it works... But primetime Saturday night viewing it ain’t."
[15]
Digital Spy
's Alex Fletcher noted: "Not since the days of
Mr Blobby
and
Ice Warriors
have weekends been filled with such peculiar antics."
[16]
The second episode, aired on 30 April, achieved an audience of 1.39m (10.5%).
[17]
By the fourth episode, the viewing audience had declined to 900,000 viewers (a 5.9% audience share).
[18]
Because the show was so poorly received, BBC One decided to reschedule it to an earlier timeslot, beginning on 14 May.
Don't Scare the Hare
was moved from 17:25 to 16:40,
[18]
while the
second series
of
So You Think You Can Dance?
- whose ratings also struggled - was aired earlier. The schedule change was spurred on by the broadcast of the
2011 Eurovision Song Contest
, which aired on 14 May.
[19]
On the previous day, 13 May, the BBC had announced that the series would be cancelled after only three episodes had been aired. Speaking about the programme on an edition of
BBC Breakfast
, the BBC's entertainment controller Mark Linsey said: "Obviously
Hare
is not going well. It was a huge risk we took - it’s co-hosted by an animatronic hare - and while it’s proved successful with children, we were hoping there would be enough knowingness within the show to draw in the adults. There wasn’t enough of that, which is where it fell down."
[20]
[21]
The final 3 episodes which hadn't aired were rescheduled for October.

Boatyard in Bristol with mechanism for maintaining water and silt levels in the harbour
For the album by Big Big Train, see
The Underfall Yard
.
Underfall Yard's former pump room - redeveloped in the 2015 project to become the visitor centre
General view of Underfall Yard
The
Underfall Yard
is a historic boatyard on
Spike Island
serving
Bristol Harbour
in England.
Underfall Yard was commonly referred to as "The Underfalls" and takes its name from the underfall
sluices
. The construction was completed in 1809 under the direction of
William Jessop
and substantially improved  by
Isambard Kingdom Brunel
in the 1830s.
Restored in the 1990s, Underfall Yard has been designated as a
scheduled monument
and from the 1970s onward many of the buildings at Underfall Yard have been given
Grade II Listed Building
status. The harbour and its equipment are still maintained, and house a number of maritime related companies.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
In the early nineteenth century the engineer,
William Jessop
was engaged by the Bristol Dock Company to create a
Floating Harbour
to eliminate the problem of ships being grounded at low tide. Jessop built a
lock
to  retain the water in the harbour; this was completed in 1809, and allowed ships to remain floating at all times, unaffected by the state of the tide on the river. Part of the project included building a dam at the Underfall Yard with a
weir
, known as the Overfall, to allow surplus river water to flow into the
New Cut
, an excavation which by-passed the Floating Harbour and joined the
River Avon
near
Temple Meads
.
[2]
The docks' maintenance facility was established on the land exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour, and remains sited at this location to the present day. By the 1830s the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting and
Isambard Kingdom Brunel
devised the
underfall sluices
based on William Jessop's original plans and recommended the use of
dredgers
as a solution .
[3]
[4]
The Bristol Docks Company never achieved commercial success and was taken over by
Bristol City Council
in 1848. In 1880 the Council bought the
Slipway
and yard to enlarge the docks' maintenance facilities.
The 'Underfall' system was re-built in the 1880s, with longer sluices, and the yard above was enlarged. Brunel's method of silt disposal is still in operation today, but the silt is carried in mud barges or pumped to the sluices through a quayside pipe system from the more efficient modern
'Cutter-Suction' dredgers
.
[5]
During the 20th century the western parts of the yard were leased to
P & A Campbell Ltd
, operators of the
White Funnel Line
of
paddle steamers
as a maintenance base. The yards have been little altered recently except for the replacement of the three-storey 'A' block over the sluice paddle room resulting from bomb damage in
World War II
.
Underfall Yard has been refurbished under the management of the Underfall Yard Trust (previously Underfall Restoration Trust).
Based at the yard are maritime academies, a scout sailing section, a blacksmith, rigging company, Omni, and three boat building businesses.
[6]
In 2015 a major restoration project was announced with the work including the development of a cafe and visitor centre.
[7]
An oral history project is being conducted and school education programmes have been introduced as part of the restoration and redevelopment.
In the early morning of 6 May 2023, the yard caught fire destroying several boats and a maintenance shed.
[8]
Underfall sluices
[
edit
]
The sluices
Jessop's original designs for the harbour included a dam with an 'overfall', with the level of the water determined by the height of the dam's crest. As a result of the accumulation of mud and silt in the harbour, ships entering the narrow harbour were frequently being grounded. In 1832 Brunel was called upon to provide the solution to this problem and designed the sluice system, still in use today, to remove excesses of silt and mud.
[9]
In place of the Overfall he constructed three shallow
sluices
and one deep scouring sluice, between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel, known as a drag boat, to scrape the silt away from the quay walls. Sluices 1, 2 and 4 ('shallow') are used to control the water level, while sluice 3  ('deep') removes the silt. When the deep sluice is opened at low tide, a powerful
undertow
is created which sucks the silt out of the harbour and into the river. Since the original introduction of the sluices, they have been changed and renewed several times but today's sluice system was installed in the 1880s.
[10]
In March 1988, the sluice control was computerised and automated.
[5]
Buildings
[
edit
]
Most of the buildings and engineering installations at the yard were constructed between 1880 and 1890 under the direction of
John Ward Girdlestone
.
[2]
Many of them have been designated by
English Heritage
as
listed buildings
.
The
octagonal
brick and
terracotta
chimney
of the engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed,
[11]
as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It replaced the original pumping house which is now
The Pump House
visitor centre. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and originally contained two steam engine powered pumps. These were replaced in 1907 by the current electrically powered machines from Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of
Paisley
(the currently installed electric motors were manufactured by JH Holmes & Co, Hebburn-upon-Tyne and date from 1938-9). It powered the docks hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks.
[12]
External
Hydraulic accumulator
The tower houses a raised weight
hydraulic accumulator
which stores the hydraulic energy ensuring a smooth delivery of pressure and meaning that the pumps do not need to be running the whole time in order to satisfy peak demand. The external accumulator was added in 1954. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps. The working pressure is 750
lbf/in²
(5.2
MPa
).
[13]
Dock maintenance workshops
[
edit
]
The Patent Slip, built in the 1890s
The dock maintenance workshops survive from the 1880s but were extended in the early 20th century. The brick building is topped with a tiled double-pile
hipped roof
with
corbelled
eaves. It has sliding doors at each end, giving access to the boiler and engine houses, blacksmith's and engineer's shops. Much of the original machinery survives, including steam-powered plant from the mid-1880s, these include a
Whitworth
planing machine
, a Whitworth slotting machine, punching-and-shearing machines, a long-bed
lathe
and a
steam hammer
. There is also wall-mounted line-shafting and a
Tangye
horizontal engine and
Cornish boiler
.
[14]
Pattern maker's shop
[
edit
]
The former
pattern-maker's
shop and stores date from the same period and are grade II listed,
[15]
Many of the original wooden patterns still exist with some being used for educational purposes, some being put on display, and others have been kept for operational purposes.
[10]
The shop is occupied by RB Boatbuilding Ltd, a small business dedicated to the re-creation of classic, late 19th century, wooden working boats, including the
Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter
.
[16]
The
Slipway Co-operative
Ltd manages the slipping of boats. They build, repair and restore wooden craft including the 14 feet (4 m)
Bristol Jolly Boat
.
[17]
Slipway
[
edit
]
The original slipway was built by John Ward Girdlestone in 1890 which had replaced a predecessor built in the 1850s by boat builders
Ross and Sage
. It used a system in which the ship is floated onto the cradle and secured. The cradle is then drawn out of the water with a steam-driven
winch
. The device was a low-cost alternative to dry docks for maintenance and repair work. This became known as the
Patent slipway
or 'Heave-up Slip' and was patented in 1819 by shipbuilder
Thomas Morton
of
Leith
in Scotland.
[5]
The 1890 replacement was originally driven by an hydraulic engine powered by the dock's hydraulic system. In 1924, an electric motor was installed which still operates today. The Bristol slipway is relatively small with a cradle of 100 feet (30 m) and a runway of 265 feet (81 m) and can lift vessels up to 250 tons (250 tonnes).
[5]
[18]
The three electronic pumping engines
It fell into disuse by 1974. By the 1990s this was rotting and was rebuilt by members of the Slipway Co-operative and Underfall Trust in 1998-99. The restoration required the complete renewal of the underwater runway with steel piling to replace the previous timber, iron and masonry supports. The above-water track was re-laid, reusing the original
cast iron
centre rails with their integral
ratchets
. The cradle was completely rebuilt on the original pattern.
[5]
The functioning of the slipway was essential for the long-term preservation of the restored Underfall Yard as a historic industrial monument, as it provided the Underfall Restoration Trust with funds to maintain the slipway and buildings, and the tenants of those buildings with boats to earn a living.
[19]
The Pump Room
[
edit
]
The power house at Underfall Yard was built in 1887 to supply hydraulic power to a network around the floating harbour. It was originally powered by steam (the large chimney remains from this system). The room which is now the visitor centre housed three boilers which powered steam hydraulic pumps. There are three electric pumps in the room adjacent to the visitor centre which are regularly run to demonstrate how they worked. These three pumps are 1907 replacements for the originals.
[20]
The Big Shed
[
edit
]
Originally used as a place in which large items such as lock gates were built, the Big Shed was used by maritime businesses and is not open to the public.

New York
, often called
New York City
[b]
or simply
NYC
, is the
most populous city
in the
United States
. With a population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km
2
) in 2020, the city is the
most densely populated
major city in the United States. NYC is more than twice as populous as
Los Angeles
, the nation's second-most populous city. New York City is at the southern tip of
New York State
and is situated on
one of the world's largest natural harbors
. The city comprises
five boroughs
, each of which is coextensive with a respective
county
. The five boroughs, which were created in 1898 when local governments were
consolidated
into a single municipality, are:
Brooklyn
(Kings County),
Queens
(Queens County),
Manhattan
(New York County),
the Bronx
(Bronx County), and
Staten Island
(Richmond County).

, New York is an important center for
international diplomacy
,
[15]
[16]
and it is sometimes described as the world's most important city
[17]
and the capital of the world.
[18]
[19]
The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the
Northeast megalopolis
and the
New York metropolitan area
, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and
urban area
. With over 20.1 million people in its
metropolitan statistical area
and 23.5 million in its
combined statistical area
as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous
megacities
.
[20]
The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal
immigration to the United States
. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,
[21]
making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York City enforces a
right-to-shelter
law guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs shelter, regardless of their immigration status;
[22]
and the city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.
[23]
It is the most visited U.S. city by international visitors.
[24]
Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the
nickname
The City That Never Sleeps
, the
New York City Subway
is the largest single-operator
rapid transit
system in the world with 472
passenger rail stations

Penn Station
in
Midtown Manhattan
is the busiest transportation hub in the
Western Hemisphere
.
[25]
New York City traces its origins to
Fort Amsterdam
and a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by
Dutch
colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named
New Amsterdam
(
Dutch
:
Nieuw Amsterdam
) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under
British control
in 1664 and was renamed New York after King
Charles II
granted the lands to his brother, the
Duke of York
.
[26]
The city was temporarily regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange; the city has been named New York since November 1674. New York City was the
capital of the United States
from 1785 until 1790,
[27]
and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The
Statue of Liberty
greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. via
Ellis Island
by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.
[28]
Anchored by
Wall Street
in the
Financial District
of
Lower Manhattan
, New York City has been called both the world's leading
financial
and
fintech
center
[29]
[30]
and the most economically powerful city in the world,
[31]
and is home to the world's two
largest stock exchanges
by
market capitalization
of their listed companies: the
New York Stock Exchange
and
Nasdaq
.
[32]
[33]
As of 2021
, the New York metropolitan area is the
second-largest metropolitan economy in the world
with a
gross metropolitan product
of almost $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were
its own country
, it would have the
tenth-largest economy
in the world. New York City is an established safe haven for global investors.
[34]
As of 2023
, New York City is the most expensive city in the world for
expatriates
to live.
[35]
New York City is home to the
highest number of billionaires
,
[36]
[37]
individuals of ultra-high
net worth
(greater than US$30 million),
[38]
and
millionaires
of any city in the world.
[39]
Many
districts and monuments
in New York City are major landmarks, including three of the world's ten-most-visited tourist attractions in 2023.
[40]
A record 66.6 million tourists visited New York City in 2019.

[43]
Many of the city's landmarks,
skyscrapers
, and

are known around the world, and the city's fast pace led to the phrase
New York minute
. The
Empire State Building
is a global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures.

Early history
Main article:
History of New York City (prehistory-1664)
In the
pre-Columbian era
, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by
Algonquians
, including the
Lenape
. Their homeland, known as
Lenapehoking
, included the present-day areas of
Staten Island
, Manhattan,
the Bronx
, the western portion of
Long Island
(including
Brooklyn
and
Queens
), and the
Lower Hudson Valley
.
[48]
The first documented visit into
New York Harbor
by a European was in 1524 by Italian
Giovanni da Verrazzano
, an explorer from
Florence
in the service of the
French crown
.
[49]
He claimed the area for France and named it
Nouvelle Angoulême
(
New Angoulême
).
[50]
A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain
Estêvão Gomes
sailing for
Emperor Charles V
, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the
Hudson River
, which he named
Río de San Antonio
('Saint Anthony's River').
[51]
In 1609, the English explorer
Henry Hudson
rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the
Northwest Passage
to the
Orient
for the
Dutch East India Company
.
[52]
He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the
North River
(now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the
Mauritius
after
Maurice, Prince of Orange
. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a very good Harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and "full of fish".
[53]
Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between
Cape Cod
and
Delaware Bay
was claimed by the Netherlands and called
Nieuw-Nederland
('
New Netherland
').
The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was
Juan Rodriguez
, a merchant from
Santo Domingo
who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613-14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch colonists.
Broadway
, from 159th Street to 218th Street in
Upper Manhattan
, is named Juan Rodriguez Way to recount this historical significance

New Amsterdam
, centered in what eventually became
Lower Manhattan
, in 1664, the year
England
took control and renamed it New York
A permanent European presence near
New York Harbor
was established in 1624, making New York the
12th-oldest continuously occupied
European-established settlement in the
continental United States
, with the founding of a Dutch
fur trading
settlement on
Governors Island
. In 1625, construction was started on a
citadel
and
Fort Amsterdam
, later called
Nieuw Amsterdam
(New Amsterdam), on present-day
Manhattan Island
.
[56]
[57]
The colony of New Amsterdam was centered on what would ultimately become
Lower Manhattan
. Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day
Wall Street
, where a 12-foot (3.7 m) wooden
stockade
was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British raids.
[58]
In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General
Peter Minuit
, acting as charged by the
Dutch West India Company
, purchased the island of Manhattan from the
Canarsie
, a small Lenape band,
[59]
for "the value of 60
guilders
"
[60]
(about $900 in 2018).
[61]
A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.
[62]
[63]
Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.
[26]
To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the
patroon system
in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (
patroons
, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.
[64]
Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a
monopoly
in New Netherland, on authority granted by the
Dutch States General
. In 1639-1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the
Dutch West Indies
).
[26]
[65]
In 1647,
Peter Stuyvesant
began his tenure as the last
Director-General
of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.
[66]
[67]
Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he earned a reputation as a
despotic
leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the
Dutch Reformed Church
, and blocked other religious groups (including
Quakers
,
Jews
, and
Lutherans
) from establishing houses of worship.
[68]
The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.

In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel
Richard Nicolls
, without bloodshed.
[68]
[69]
The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.
[70]
In 1667, during negotiations leading to the
Treaty of Breda
after the
Second Anglo-Dutch War
, the victorious Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now
Suriname
on the northern South American coast, which they had gained from the English;
[71]
and in return, the English kept
New Amsterdam
. The fledgling settlement was promptly renamed "New York" after the
Duke of York
(the future King James II and VII).
[72]
After the founding, the duke gave part of the colony to proprietors
George Carteret
and
John Berkeley
.
Fort Orange
, 150 miles (240 km) north on the
Hudson River
, was renamed
Albany
after James's Scottish title.
[73]
On August 24, 1673, during the
Third Anglo-Dutch War
,
Anthony Colve
of the Dutch navy
seized New York from the English
at the behest of
Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest
and rechristened it "New Orange" after
William III
, the
Prince of Orange
.
[74]
The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the
Treaty of Westminster
of November 1674.
[75]
[76]
Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some
epidemics
brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.
[77]
By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.
[78]
New York experienced several
yellow fever
epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population in 1702 alone.
[79]
[80]
In the early 18th century, New York grew in importance as a
trading port
while as a part of the
colony of New York
.
[81]
It became a center of
slavery
, with 42% of households enslaving Africans by 1730.
[82]
Most cases were that of
domestic slavery
; others were hired out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banking and shipping industries trading with the
American South
. During construction in
Foley Square
in the 1990s, the
African Burying Ground
was discovered; the cemetery included 10,000 to 20,000 of graves of colonial-era Africans, some enslaved and some free.
[83]
The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of
John Peter Zenger
, who had been accused of
seditious libel
after criticizing
colonial governor
William Cosby
, helped to establish
freedom of the press
in North America.
[84]
In 1754,
Columbia University
was founded under charter by
King George II
as King's College in Lower Manhattan.

[86]
The
Battle of Long Island
, the largest battle of the
American Revolutionary War
, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn.
[87]
After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for
Loyalist
refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the
Crown
. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces
evacuated
New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of
freedmen
for resettlement in
Nova Scotia
, England, and the
Caribbean
.
[88]
The attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the
Conference House
on Staten Island between American delegates, including
Benjamin Franklin
, and British general
Lord Howe
on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the
Great Fire of New York
occurred, a large conflagration on the
West Side
of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including
Trinity Church
.

Post-revolutionary period and early 19th century

History of New York City (1784-1854)
First inauguration of George Washington
in 1789
In 1785, the assembly of the
Congress of the Confederation
made New York City the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the
Articles of Confederation
and the first capital under the
Constitution of the United States
.
[90]
As the U.S. capital, New York City hosted several events of national scope in 1789—the first President of the United States,
George Washington
, was inaugurated; the first
United States Congress
and the
Supreme Court of the United States
each assembled for the first time; and the
United States Bill of Rights
was drafted, all at
Federal Hall
on
Wall Street
.
[90]
In 1790, for the first time, New York City, surpassed
Philadelphia
as the nation's largest city. At the end of that year, the national capital was
moved to Philadelphia
.
[91]
[92]
Over the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.
[93]
Under New York State's
abolition
act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in
indentured servitude
until their mid-to-late twenties.
[94]
[95]
Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-Black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential
United States founders
as
Alexander Hamilton
and
John Jay
, the
New York Manumission Society
worked for abolition and established the
African Free School
to educate Black children.
[96]
It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free Blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School.

In the 19th century, the city was transformed by both commercial and residential development relating to its status as a national and
international trading center
, as well as by European immigration, respectively.
[100]
The city adopted the
Commissioners' Plan of 1811
, which expanded the city
street grid
to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the
Erie Canal
through
central New York
connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the
Hudson River
and the
Great Lakes
.
[101]
Local politics became dominated by
Tammany Hall
, a
political machine
supported by
Irish
and
German immigrants
.
[102]
Several prominent American
literary figures
lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including
William Cullen Bryant
,
Washington Irving
,
Herman Melville
,
Rufus Wilmot Griswold
,
John Keese
,
Nathaniel Parker Willis
, and
Edgar Allan Poe
. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of
Central Park
, which in 1857 became the first
landscaped park
in an American city.
[103]
and one of the most filmed and visited locations in the world, with 40 million visitors in 2013.
[104]
The
Great Irish Famine
brought a large influx of
Irish immigrants
, of whom more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, representing upward of one-quarter of the city's population.
[105]
There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.

Democratic Party
candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor
Fernando Wood
called on the
aldermen

[96]
Anger at new
military conscription
laws during the
American Civil War
(1861-1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the
Draft Riots of 1863
, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.
[96]
The
draft riots
deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the
New York Police Department
, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.
[106]
At least 120 people were killed.
[108]
Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865. The White working class had established dominance.
[106]
[108]
Violence by
longshoremen
against Black men was especially fierce in the docks area.

African diaspora
in North America.

London
. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first

Returning
World War II
veterans created a post-war
economic boom
and the development of large
housing tracts
in eastern Queens and
Nassau County
. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with
Wall Street
leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The
United Nations headquarters
was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global
geopolitical
influence, and the rise of
abstract expressionism
in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.

History of New York City (1978-present)
and
September 11 attacks
In the 1970s, job losses due to
industrial restructuring
caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.
[121]
While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.
[122]
By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities,
gentrification
, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
New York City's population reached all-time highs in the
2000
,
2010
, and
2020
US censuses. Important new sectors, such as
Silicon Alley
, emerged in the city's economy.

in 2001
The advent of
Y2K
was celebrated with fanfare in
Times Square
.
[124]
New York City suffered the bulk of the
economic damage
and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the
September 11, 2001, attacks
.
[125]
Two of the four airliners hijacked that day were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying the towers and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers. The North Tower became, and remains, the tallest building to ever be destroyed.
[126]
The area was rebuilt
with a new
World Trade Center
, the
National September 11 Memorial and Museum
, and other new buildings and infrastructure.
[127]
The
World Trade Center PATH station
, which had opened on July 19, 1909, as the Hudson Terminal,
[

]
was destroyed in the attacks. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003.
[

An 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m
2
) permanent rail station designed by
Santiago Calatrava
, the
World Trade Center Transportation Hub
, the city's third-largest hub, was completed in 2016.
[128]
The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere
[129]
and the
seventh-tallest building in the world
by
pinnacle
height, with its
spire
reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of
U.S. independence
.
[130]
[131]
[132]
The
Occupy Wall Street
protests in
Zuccotti Park
in the
Financial District
of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the
Occupy movement
against
social
and
economic inequality
worldwide.
[133]
New York City was
heavily affected
by
Hurricane Sandy
in late October 2012. Sandy's impacts included the flooding of the
New York City Subway
system, of many suburban communities, and of all road tunnels entering
Manhattan
except the
Lincoln Tunnel
. The
New York Stock Exchange
closed for two consecutive days. At least 43 people died in New York City as a result of Sandy, and the economic losses in New York City were estimated to be roughly $19 billion. The disaster spawned long-term efforts towards infrastructural projects to counter
climate change
and rising seas.
[134]
In March 2020, the first case of
COVID-19
in the city was confirmed in Manhattan.
[135]
The city rapidly replaced
Wuhan, China
to become the global epicenter of the
pandemic
during the early phase, before the infection became widespread across the world and the rest of the nation. As of March 2021, New York City had recorded
over 30,000 deaths
from COVID-19-related complications.
Geography
Main articles:
Geography of New York City
and
Geography of New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary
Aerial view of the
New York City metropolitan area
with
Manhattan
at its center
New York City is situated in the
northeastern United States
, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between
Washington, D.C.
and
Boston
. Its location at the mouth of the
Hudson River
, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of the city is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.
During the
Wisconsin glaciation
, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large
ice sheet
.
[136]
The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now
Long Island
and
Staten Island
. That action left
bedrock
at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid
foundation
for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.
[137]
The Hudson River flows through the
Hudson Valley
into
New York Bay
. Between New York City and
Troy, New York
, the river is an
estuary
.
[138]
The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of
New Jersey
. The
East River
—a
tidal strait
—flows from
Long Island Sound
and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The
Harlem River
, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The
Bronx River
, which flows through the Bronx and
Westchester County
, is the only entirely
freshwater
river in the city.
[139]
[
importance?
]
The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable
land reclamation
along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in
Lower Manhattan
, with developments such as
Battery Park City
in the 1970s and 1980s.
[140]
Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.
[141]
The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km
2
). 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km
2
) of the city is land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km
2
) of is water.
[142]
[143]
The highest point in the city is
Todt Hill
on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m)
above sea level
, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of
Maine
.
[144]
The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in
woodlands
as part of the
Staten Island Greenbelt
.

Staten Island
New York City
is sometimes referred to collectively as the
Five Boroughs
.
[146]
Each borough is coextensive with a respective
county
of
New York State
, making New York City one of the
U.S. municipalities in multiple counties
.
Manhattan
(New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough. It is home to
Central Park
and most of the city's
skyscrapers
, and is sometimes locally known as
The City
.
[147]
Manhattan's population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km
2
) in 2015 makes it the
highest of any county in the United States
and
higher than the density of any individual American city
.
[148]
Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and
financial center
of New York City and contains the
headquarters
of many major
multinational corporations
, the
United Nations headquarters
,
Wall Street
, and a number of important universities. The borough of Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.
[149]
[150]
Brooklyn
(Kings County), on the western tip of
Long Island
, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene,
distinct neighborhoods
, and a distinctive architectural heritage.
Downtown Brooklyn
is the largest central core neighborhood in the Outer Boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including
Coney Island
, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the U.S.
[151]
Marine Park
and
Prospect Park
are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.
[152]
Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of
entrepreneurship
and
high technology
startup firms
,
[153]
[154]
and of
postmodern art
and design.
[154]
[155]
Brooklyn is also home to
Fort Hamilton
, the
U.S. military's
only active duty installation within New York City,
[156]
aside from
Coast Guard
operations. The facility was established in 1825 on the site of a
battery
used during the
American Revolution
, and it is one of America's longest serving military forts.
[157]
Queens
(Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most
ethnically diverse
county in the United States,
[158]
and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.
[159]
[160]
Queens is the site of the
Citi Field
baseball stadium, home of the
New York Mets
, and hosts the annual
U.S. Open tennis tournament
at
Flushing Meadows-Corona Park
. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area,
John F. Kennedy International Airport
and
LaGuardia Airport
, are in Queens.
The Bronx
(Bronx County) is both New York City's northernmost borough, and the only one that is mostly on the mainland. It is the location of
Yankee Stadium
, the baseball park of the
New York Yankees
, and home to the largest
cooperatively-owned housing
complex in the United States,
Co-op City
.
[161]
It is home to the
Bronx Zoo
, the world's largest metropolitan zoo,
[162]
which spans 265 acres (1.07 km
2
) and houses more than 6,000 animals.
[163]
The Bronx is the birthplace of
hip hop music
and its associated
culture
.
[164]
Pelham Bay Park
is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).
[165]
Staten Island
(Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. It is connected to Brooklyn by the
Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge
, and to Manhattan by way of the free
Staten Island Ferry
. In central Staten Island, the
Staten Island Greenbelt
spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km
2
), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.
[166]
Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.

Under the
Köppen climate classification
, New York City has a
humid subtropical climate
(Cfa), and is the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west are in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and
humid continental climates
(Dfa).
[167]
[168]
Annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine.
[169]
Winters are chilly and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow
sea breezes
offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the
Appalachian Mountains
keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 33.3 °F (0.7 °C).
[170]
Temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter,
[171]
yet can also reach 60 °F (16 °C) for several days even in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 77.5 °F (25.3 °C) in July.
[170]
Nighttime temperatures are often enhanced due to the
urban heat island
effect. Daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °F (38 °C), although this is a rare achievement, last occurring on July 18, 2012.
[172]
Similarly, readings of 0 °F (−18 °C) are extremely rare, last occurring on February 14, 2016.
[173]
Extreme temperatures have ranged from −15 °F (−26 °C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936;
[170]
the coldest recorded wind chill was −37 °F (−38 °C) on the same day as the all-time record low.
[174]
The record cold daily maximum was 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum was 87 °F (31 °C), on July 2, 1903.
[172]
The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7 °F (4.3 °C) in February to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in August.
[175]
The city receives 49.5 inches (1,260 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1991 and 2020 was 29.8 inches (76 cm); this varies considerably between years.
Hurricanes
and
tropical storms
are rare in the New York area.
[176]
Hurricane Sandy
brought a destructive
storm surge
to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs.
[177]
The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing
seawalls
and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

,
[447]
respectively.
Chinese
and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints,
trattorias
,
diners
, and
coffeehouses
are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as
falafel
and
kebabs
[448]
examples of modern New York
street food
. The city is home to "nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse
haute cuisine
restaurants in the world", according to
Michelin
.

Parades
The annual
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
, the world's largest parade
[453]
New York City is well known for its street
parades
, the majority held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual

Canyon of Heroes
on
Broadway
from
Bowling Green
to
City Hall Park
in Lower Manhattan.
Accent and dialect
Main articles:
New York City English
and
New York accent
The New York area is home to a distinctive regional accent and speech pattern called the
New York dialect
, alternatively known as
Brooklynese
or
New Yorkese
. It has been considered one of the most recognizable accents within
American English
.
[455]
The traditional New York area speech pattern is known for its rapid delivery, and its accent is characterized as
non-rhotic
so that the sound
[ɹ]
does not appear at the end of a
syllable
or immediately before a
consonant
, therefore the pronunciation of the city name as "New Yawk".
[456]
The classic version of the New York City dialect is centered on
middle-
and
working-class
New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,
[456]
and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent.

Transportation in New York City
Rapid transit
Port Authority Bus Terminal
, the world's busiest bus station, at
Eighth Avenue
and
42nd Street
[482]
Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.
[483]
[484]
Buses
New York City's public
bus fleet
runs 24/7 and is the largest in North America.
[485]
The
Port Authority Bus Terminal
, the main
intercity bus
terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.
[482]
Rail
Main article:
New York City Subway
New York City is home to the two busiest
train stations
in the U.S.,
Grand Central Terminal
(pictured) and
Penn Station
.
The
New York City Subway
, the world's largest
rapid transit
system by number of
stations
The
New York City Subway
system is the largest
rapid transit
system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities.
[486]
The New York City Subway is
the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere
,
[487]
with 1.70 billion passenger rides in 2019,
[488]
while
Grand Central Terminal
, referred to as "Grand Central Station", is the world's largest
railway station
by number of
train platforms
.
[489]
Public transport is widely used in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit.
[490]
This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace.
[491]
According to the
New York City Comptroller
, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6
hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities.
[492]
New York is the only U.S. city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car.
[493]
Due to their
high usage of mass transit
, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.
[494]
New York City's
commuter rail
network is the largest in North America.
[483]
The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the
Long Island Rail Road
,
Metro-North Railroad
, and
New Jersey Transit
. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and
Pennsylvania Station
and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.
[483]
For 24 hours a day, the elevated
AirTrain
system in Queens connects
JFK International Airport
to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the
Grand Central Parkway
to connect
LaGuardia Airport
to these transit systems.
[495]
[496]
For
inter-city rail
, New York City is served by
Amtrak
, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the
West Side
of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to
Boston
,
Philadelphia
, and
Washington, D.C.
along the
Northeast Corridor
, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.
[497]
The
Staten Island Railway
rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The
Port Authority Trans-Hudson
(PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to
northeastern New Jersey
. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the
Chicago "L"
, the
PATCO Speedline
serving Philadelphia, and the
Copenhagen Metro
).
[498]
[499]
Multibillion-dollar
heavy rail
transit projects under construction in New York City include the
Second Avenue Subway
.

Aviation in the New York metropolitan area
John F. Kennedy Airport
in
Queens
New York's airspace
is the busiest in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include
John F. Kennedy International Airport
,
Newark Liberty International Airport
, and
LaGuardia Airport
; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016.
[501]
JFK and Newark Liberty were the
busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways
for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011
, JFK was the
busiest airport for international passengers
in North America.
[502]
Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport,
Stewart International Airport
near
Newburgh, New York
, by the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
.
[503]
Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities
[

.
[504]
Other commercial airports in or serving the
New York metropolitan area
include
Long Island MacArthur Airport

The
Staten Island Ferry
shuttles
commuters
between
Manhattan
and
Staten Island
.
The
Staten Island Ferry
is the world's busiest
ferry route
, carrying more than 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on a 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running
24/7
.
[505]
[506]
Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area.
NYC Ferry
, a
NYCEDC
initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017.
[507]
Other features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass 13,587
yellow taxicabs
;
[508]
other
vehicle for hire
companies;
[509]
[510]
and the
Roosevelt Island Tramway
, an

that transports commuters between
Roosevelt Island
and Manhattan Island.
Cycling network
Main article:
Cycling in New York City
Citi Bike
bike share service, which started in May 2013
New York City has mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with stop-and-go traffic, and many pedestrians. The city's large cycling population includes
utility cyclists
, such as delivery and messenger services; recreational
cycling clubs
; and an increasing number of
commuters
. Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 in 2005.
[511]
As of 2017
, New York City had 1,333 miles (2,145 km) of bike lanes, compared to 513 miles (826 km) in 2006.
[511]
As of 2019, there are 126 miles (203 km) of segregated or "protected" bike lanes citywide.
[512]
Streets and highways
Further information:
List of bridges and tunnels in New York City
and
Commissioners' Plan of 1811
Streets are also a defining feature of the city. The
Commissioners' Plan of 1811
greatly influenced its physical development. Several streets and avenues, including
Broadway
,
[513]
Wall Street
,
[514]
Madison Avenue
,
[342]
and
Seventh Avenue
are used as
metonyms
for national industries: theater, finance, advertising, and fashion, respectively. New York City has an extensive web of
freeways
and
parkways
, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to
North Jersey
,
Westchester County
,
Long Island
, and southwestern
Connecticut
through
bridges and tunnels
. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who
commute
into Manhattan, it is common for motorists to be stranded for hours in
traffic congestion
that are a daily occurrence, particularly during
rush hour
.
[515]
[516]
Congestion pricing in New York City
will go into effect in 2022 at the earliest
[
needs update
]
.
[517]
[518]
[519]
Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.
[520]
The
George Washington Bridge
, across the
Hudson River
, is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge.
[521]
[522]
Manhattan and Staten Island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is on New York State's mainland. Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and to
New Jersey
by an extensive network of bridges and tunnels. The 14-lane
George Washington Bridge
, connecting Manhattan to
New Jersey
across the
Hudson River
, is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge.
[521]
[522]
The
Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge
, spanning
the Narrows
between Brooklyn and Staten Island, is the longest
suspension bridge
in the Americas and one of the world's longest.
[523]
[524]
The
Brooklyn Bridge
, with its stone neo-Gothic suspension towers, is an icon of the city itself; opened in 1883, it was the first steel-wire suspension bridge and was the longest suspension bridge in the world until 1903.
[525]
[526]
The
Queensboro Bridge
"was the longest
cantilever span
in North America" from 1909 to 1917.
[527]
The
Manhattan Bridge
, opened in 1909, "is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges", and its design "served as the model for the major long-span suspension bridges" of the early 20th century.
[528]
The
Throgs Neck Bridge
and
Whitestone Bridge
connect Queens and the Bronx, while the
Triborough Bridge
connects the three boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx.
Lincoln Tunnel
The
Lincoln Tunnel
, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.
[529]
The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and
cargo ships
that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The
Holland Tunnel
, connecting Lower Manhattan to
Jersey City, New Jersey
, was the first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.
[530]
[531]
The
Queens-Midtown Tunnel
, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.
[532]
The
Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel
(officially known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) runs underneath
Battery Park
and connects the
Financial District
in Lower Manhattan to
Red Hook
in Brooklyn.

Siluranodon auritus
is the only
species
in the
genus
Siluranodon
of the
catfish
(
order
Siluriformes)
family
Schilbeidae
.
[1]
This species is known from the
Nile River
and the
Chad
,
Niger
,
Volta
, and
Comoe
basins.
[1]
In the
Sudd
, these fish have been found to occur beneath fringing
Eichhornia
.
[2]
Although it has been previously thought that fish of this species lack teeth, it has been found that they have very reduced teeth. As the fish grows, teeth on the upper jaw are lost due to damage, while teeth on the lower jaw are overgrown by the surrounding bone.
[3]
It has been suggested that this species exhibits
pedomorphosis
, that is, they retain many juvenile traits into adulthood. Some of these include an absence of a
dorsal fin spine
and a reduced number of
ribs
.
[3]
S. auritus
reaches a length of about 17.5
centimetres
(6.9

)
TL
.
[2]
As adults,
S. auritus
are filter-feeders, feeding primarily on
phytoplankton
and
zooplankton
.
[3]
Stomachs
of fish have been examined to contain zooplankton,
chironomids
and
debris
.
[2]
These fish are
oviparous
and the eggs are unguarded.

Theoretical
physicist
John Hartley Brodie
(May 6, 1969
[1]
- January 28, 2006), was an American theoretical
physicist
specializing in
string theory
. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a psychotic episode in 2002, he left academia in 2004.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Brodie was born in
Worcester, Massachusetts
to the British born
Quaker
biochemists
Angela Hartley Brodie
and
Harry Brodie
. His grandfather
Herbert Hartley
had also been a biochemist. He was raised in
Columbia, Maryland
, where he graduated from
Atholton High School
. 
Brodie received
bachelor's
and
master's degrees
in physics from
Cornell University
in 1991 and 1992, respectively. He took one year off to travel the world, mainly in the
Far East
, where he developed an interest in
Eastern philosophies
and
religions
.
[2]
He returned to doctoral studies at
Princeton University
, receiving a
Ph.D.
in
theoretical physics
in 1998.
[2]
Scientific career, 1998-2004
[
edit
]
Brodie accepted post-doctorate offers first at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
, and in 2001 at the
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
in
Waterloo, Ontario
, Canada.
[2]
One of the first postdoctoral researchers at Perimeter institute, Brodie's work was notable for its breadth, ranging from
non-perturbative
effects in
supersymmetric gauge theories
to string theoretic descriptions of
quantum Hall
fluids and of
inflationary cosmology
.
[3]
During his short career, he published fifteen articles in peer-review journals, many of which have proven to be influential.
[3]
In 2002, Brodie had a psychotic episode and was diagnosed with
bipolar disorder
. He tried taking medication, but searched for an alternative to
mainstream medicine
.
[4]
Humanistic life
[
edit
]
In 2004, Brodie took a leave of absence from research and publication in disciplinary journals to teach at the
Monteverde Friends School
in
Costa Rica
.
[2]
Traveling to
Nicaragua
, he helped construct housing for the poor with
Habitat for Humanity
.
[2]
After his ID was stolen in Panama authorities stopped him on a bus and Brodie was held in jail.
[4]
In September 2005, after hiking much of the Appalachian Trail, he stopped in
Brattleboro, Vermont
and settled there.
[4]
In Brattleboro, he worked packing grocery bags at the local Price Chopper supermarket and attended Quaker worship at nearby Putney Friends Meeting.
[

Personal life and death
[
edit
]
Brodie was "a sharp intellect, a free spirit and a gentle person".
[3]
Friends and family have compared him to the mathematician John Nash.
[4]
On January 28, 2006, Brodie had been soliciting homes in
Hinsdale, New Hampshire
, that he was running for president. Police responded to a call and confronted him, after which he fled into the
Connecticut River
. His body was found five days later "not far from where he entered the river, about 150 feet from shore".
[4]
Eponymous award
[
edit
]
The
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
has been awarding an annual prize in Brodie's memory to celebrate independence and creativity in theoretical research.
[3]
The first recipient of the John Brodie Prize was the quantum researcher
Mohammad H. Ansari
in 2006.

The
1949-50
Chicago Black Hawks
season
was the team's
24th
season
in the
National Hockey League
. The Black Hawks finished in sixth, out of the playoffs.
Off-season

In goal, the Black Hawks acquired long-time
Boston Bruins
goaltender
Frank Brimsek
. Brimsek would play in all 70 games for the Hawks, winning 22 of them, earning five shutouts along the way, and posting a 3.49 GAA.
Regular season
[
edit
]
The Black Hawks had finished in fifth place in
1948-49
, failing to qualify for the
playoffs
for the third year in a row. Prior to the season, the NHL announced that they would be adding ten games to the regular season schedule, raising it from 60 games to 70.  Despite the extra games added, the Black Hawks would only win one more game than the previous season, and finish in last place in the NHL with 54 points, 13 behind the
New York Rangers
for the final playoff spot, missing the playoffs for the fourth straight season.
Offensively, the Hawks scoring was spread out, as 22-year-old
Metro Prystai
led the Hawks with 29 goals,
Doug Bentley
had a team high 33 assists, and
Roy Conacher
had a club-best 56 points.
Bill Gadsby
would be a force on the blueline, leading the way with 10 goals and 35 points, and having a team high 138 penalty minutes. The Hawks scored 203 goals, second highest total in the league, but would allow a league high 244 goals.

[1]
History and mandate
[
edit
]
THE UNGSC traces its roots back to the United Nations Logistics Base (UNLB), which was formed in 1994, and is currently based in
Brindisi, Italy
. The UNLB was formed due to the fact that the previous storage depot for
United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)
, the United Nations Supply Depot (UNSD), had become too small to handle the DPKO's surplus equipment.
[2]
The UNLB's primary functions were to provide: logistic support,  strategic and global information and communications technology support services and training.
In 2009, the UN Support Base in Valencia (UNSBV) was formed in
Valencia, Spain
to assist with information and telecommunications of UN missions around the world.
[3]
The base works in conjunction with UNLB to enhance the UN's capacity to respond efficiently to crises around the world.
On 24 June 2010 the
General Assembly
passed Resolution 64/269, which created the
Global Field Support Strategy (GFSS)
which merged the UNLB and UNSBV into one organization called the "Global Service Centre."  The mandate of the UNGSC is "to ensure efficient and effective peace operations through the core logistics, geospatial, information and telecommunications technology services it provides."
[4]
Services provided
[
edit
]
The UNGSC consists of three main core service areas. Some of their duties include:
[4]
Supply Chain Service
[5]
Act as focal point for Missions and HQ,
Asset and Resource Management,
Developing designs, statement of requirements and technical specifications for field missions.
Field Technology Service
[6]
Provide various global and centralized geospatial services for field operations, the secretariat and agencies,
Provide highly available wide area satellite service connectivity for all its internal and external clients,
Provide hosting of centralized applications, messaging and collaborative applications, backup and archiving, cloud and mobile computing and disaster recovery infrastructure.
Central Service
[7]
Administrative support, including: administering finances and budgets, proving human resources and procurement of goods and services for the UNGSC,
Occupational health and safety for all UN Field Mission, other UN Agencies and International Organizations,
Management of training and other learning activities hosted at the GSC.

[3]
Origin
[
edit
]
González is a Spanish name. Its origins trace back to a
Visigothic
name combining the words
gunþo(guntho)
(battle or war) and
alf
(elf); the Latinized form was Gundisalv. As the Spanish language developed, the name transformed into Gonzálo and its surname derivative González.
[4]
Some believe the name to mean "war hall", as evidenced by the castle in a field of blood on its family crest and the Visigothic cultural origins of the nation of Spain. González is also taken to mean "son of
Gonzalo
", "noble warrior", "soldier" or "castle guard".
[5]
Common spellings include: Gonzalez (no
acute accent
), Gonzáles, Gonzales, Gonzalés, González and
Goncalves
. The variant Consolus appears among people descended from a Spaniard with the surname Gonsález who settled in the Dutch colony of
New Amsterdam
.

Coracina striata
(

, 1783)
The
bar-bellied cuckooshrike
(
Coracina striata
) is a species of
bird
in the family
Campephagidae
. It is found in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and its natural
habitats
include mangrove forest, dry forest, swamp forest, and secondary forest. The plumage varies among the subspecies, with different amounts of barring on the underparts. The
International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) has assessed the species as one of least-concern.
Taxonomy
[
edit
]
The bar-bellied cuckooshrike was described by the French polymath
Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon
in 1775 in his
Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux
.
[2]
The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by
François-Nicolas Martinet
in the
Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle
which was produced under the supervision of
Edme-Louis Daubenton
to accompany Buffon's text.
[3]
Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist
Pieter Boddaert
coined the
binomial name
Corvus striatus
in his catalogue of the
Planches Enluminées
.
[4]
Buffon believed that his specimen had come from New Guinea but the species does not occur there; the
type locality
has been designated as the island of
Luzon
in the Philippines.
[5]
The bar-bellied cuckooshrike is now placed in the
genus
Coracina
that was introduced by the French ornithologist
Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot
in 1816.
[6]
[7]
The generic name
Coracina
is from the
Ancient Greek
korakinos
meaning "little raven", a diminutive of
korax
meaning "raven". The specific epithet
striata
is from the Latin
striatus
meaning "striated".
[8]
It was variously placed in the genera
Graucalus
and
Artamides
[9]
until
Coracina
was widely accepted around the early 1940s.
[10]
The
IOC World Bird List
recognises fourteen extant subspecies:
Coracina striata sumatrensis
,
C. s. simalurensis
,
C. s. babiensis
,
C. s. kannegieteri
,
C. s. enganensis
,
C. s. bungurensis
,
C. s. vordemani
,
C. s. difficilis
,
C. s. striata
,
C. s. mindorensis
,
C. s. panayensis
,
C. s. boholensis
,
C. s. kochii
and
C. s. guillemardi
.
[7]
C. s. cebuensis
, formerly found on
Cebu
, is extinct.
[11]
The
Andaman cuckooshrike
(
Coracina dobsoni
) is sometimes considered a subspecies. The
Handbook of the Birds of the World
considers
panayensis
to be a separate species.
[12]
Description
[
edit
]
The bar-bellied cuckooshrike is 24-32 centimetres (9.4-12.6 in) long. The plumage and size are variable.
[12]
In the Philippines, the subspecies
guillemardi
and
mindorensis
are uniformly grey, with some black on the male's head; in
striata
,
cebuensis
, and
difficilis
, the male has faint barring on the rump, and the female's belly is barred black and white; in
panayensis
, the male also has black and white bars on the belly, and the female has additional barred patches on the breast; in
kochii
, the male's breast is also barred, and the female's underparts are entirely barred.
[13]
[14]
In
C. s. sumatrensis
of the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, the male has grey upperparts with some barring on the rump and
lower-tail coverts
, and the female's underparts are barred up to the lower breast.
[15]
[16]
The
juvenile
bird has grey upperparts and entirely barred underparts in
panayensis
and
kochii
;
[13]
in
sumatrensis
, the juvenile has brown, white, and black upperparts, and the underparts are white with black bars.
[15]
Distribution and habitat
[
edit
]
This cuckooshrike is found in the
Thai-Malay Peninsula
,
Sumatra
,
Borneo
, the
Philippines
, and many small islands in the area, such as the
Kangean Islands
and
Natuna Islands
. It became
locally extinct
in Singapore around the late 1960s.
[15]
It lives at low elevations, its habitats being back-
mangrove forest
,
dry forest
,
freshwater swamp forest
,
[16]
secondary forest
, and sometimes
scrubs
and plantations.
[15]
Behaviour
[
edit
]
This cuckooshrike usually lives in small groups or in
mixed-species foraging flocks
with other cuckooshrikes.
[11]
It mainly eats insects, including
caterpillars
,
mantises
, and
dragonflies
, and also feeds on
figs
.
[15]
Vocalisations include a harsh
klee kleep
,
[11]
a whistling
keeuk-keeuk
,
sic sic sic
,
tliu k'liu
and a whinnying
kliukliukliu
.
[15]
Breeding has been reported in April and May. The
cup nest
is built on the fork of a tree and is made of mosses, lichens, leaves, rootlets,
[11]
and possibly mud.
[15]
The eggs are grey, marked lavender, and reddish brown.
[11]
Status
[
edit
]
This species has a large range. Its global population appears to be decreasing because of
habitat destruction
, but not rapidly, so the IUCN Red List has assessed it as a
least-concern species
.
[1]
In the Thai-Malay Peninsula, it is considered to be vulnerable.

The
Syöksy
-class motor torpedo boats
(English:
Attack
) was a series of four
British
Thornycroft type
motor torpedo boats
of the
Finnish Navy
. The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in
Woolton
, UK. The vessels saw service in
World War II
. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the
Gulf of Finland
.
[1]
In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures.
Nuoli
had the
ace of hearts
,
Vinha
the
ace of clubs
,
Syöksy
the
ace of diamonds
, and
Raju

.
[1]
Combat history
[
edit
]
On 6 July 1941
Syöksy
and
Vinha
sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead
Syöksy
dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond.
[1]
[2]
On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of
Estonia
when a Soviet
destroyer
opened fire on them.
Vinha
was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while
Syöksy
made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it.
[1]
[2]
On 1 September 1941
Syöksy
and
Vinha
were patrolling south of the
Beryozovye Islands
when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters.
Syöksy
torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS
Meero
, 1,866 tons).
[1]
[3]
On 22 September 1941
Syöksy
sank the Soviet
minehunter
T-41
(
Kirov
) east of
Gogland
while it was patrolling near the island with
Vinha
.
[1]
[4]
On 1 October 1941
Nuoli
participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from
Sisu
that sank the target.
[1]
[5]
Syöksy
,
Vinha
and
Vihuri
, as well as a
minelaying
KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of
Lavansaari
on 18 November 1942.
Syöksy
managed to torpedo the Soviet gunboat
Krasnoye Znamya
(1,760 tons), which sank.

Jean-Baptiste Lully by
Paul Mignard
Pastorale héroïque
was a type of
ballet héroïque
, a form of the
opéra-ballet
genre of
French
Baroque
opera
. The first work to bear the name was
Jean-Baptiste Lully
's final completed opera
Acis et Galatée
(1686), although musical works on pastoral themes had already appeared on the French stage. The pastorale héroïque usually drew on classical subject matter associated with
pastoral poetry
. Like the
tragédie en musique
, it had an allegorical prologue; however, its structure consisted of three acts, rather than the five of the tragédie en musique.   Later examples were written by
Jean-Philippe Rameau
; these include
Zaïs
(1748) and
Naïs
(1749), and
Acante et Céphise
(1751).

The
Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation
(BWAF), or
Beijing Workers’ Autonomous Union
(
Chinese
:
北京工人自治联合会
;
pinyin
:
Běijīng gōngrén zìzhì liánhéhuì
; popularly referred to in Chinese as gōngzìlián,
lit.
'workers' federation') was the primary
Chinese
workers' organization
calling for political change during the
Tiananmen Square protests of 1989
.  The group was formed in the wake of mourning activities for former
General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Hu Yaobang
in April 1989. The BWAF denounced
political corruption
, presenting itself as an independent union capable of "supervising the
Communist Party
," unlike the Party-controlled
All-China Federation of Trade Unions
(ACFTU).
[1]
Unlike typical labor unions, the BWAF did not establish branches in individual factories and workplaces. Nevertheless, its influence and activities expanded during its resistance to the imposition of
martial law
in May. The Federation itself was one of the casualties of the
People's Liberation Army
's violent suppression of protesters during the evening of June 3.  After the military crackdown, Party authorities labeled the BWAF an "illegal organization" and arrested its leaders.
[2]
Origins
[
edit
]
Economic reforms
initiated by
Deng Xiaoping
had improved the
living standard
of many urban workers, but by 1988, many such workers considered themselves "losers in the decade of economic reform."
[3]
Corruption and
inflation
especially angered workers, and some responded with
slowdowns
and
wildcat strikes
in 1988 to 1989.
[3]
In the days after Hu Yaobang's death on April 15, 1989, workers and other Beijing residents mourned and discussed
politics
at the
Monument to the People's Heroes
in
Tiananmen Square
. On April 20, after university students staging a
sit-in
outside
Zhongnanhai
claimed to have been beaten by
military police
, a group of workers calling themselves the "Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation" began issuing two
handbills
.
[4]
The first, the "Letter to People of the Entire City," decried "out of control" inflation, criticized corrupt officials, and called on "people from all walks of life to come together to fight for truth and the future of China."
[5]
The second handbill, "Ten Questions," demanded that top Communist Party leaders reveal how much money
Zhao Ziyang
spent playing
golf
, and how much Deng Xiaoping's son's spent
gambling
on
horse racing
. The pamphlet also questioned why "prices had risen without respite whilst the living standards of the people had dropped precipitously," asking top Party leaders disclose their
income
.
[6]
These handbills, along with fiery speeches in Tiananmen Square, helped recruit more workers to the Federation. One such recruit was
Han Dongfang
, a railway worker who would become one of the BWAF's top leaders.
[7]
Activities
[
edit
]
In late April and the first half of May, between 70 and 80
activist
workers met regularly at Tiananmen Square's western viewing stand but did not openly identify as the BWAF. In the week following students' declaration of a
hunger strike
on May 13, however, the BWAF began operating openly. During this period, Federation members sought assistance from the ACFTU, China's only officially sanctioned labor union.
[8]
Although the ACFTU had previously encouraged workers to oppose corruption and had donated 100,000
yuan
in medical aid for the hunger strikers, they did not help the BWAF.
[8]
[9]
Rebuffed in its attempts to register the organization with government authorities, the group proclaimed its founding on May 18.
[8]
A handbill dated May 20 declared that the BWAF as a "transitional organisation that the workers of the capital have spontaneously created during an extraordinary period." Its stated goals included advancement of
democracy
, opposition to
dictatorship
, and support of the hunger striking students.
[9]
According to sociologists Andrew G. Walder and Gong Xiaoxia, the BWAF wanted to independently represent workers' interests, rather than deal with specific proposals about workplace issues.
[10]
Membership in the BWAF continued to grow in the early days of June, although estimates of specific numbers vary widely; one scholar writes that the group "claimed three thousand members,"
[11]
while two former BWAF activists said that the group had registered "almost 20,000 members" by June 3.
[12]
Membership was limited to people who could prove
Beijing
residency and affiliation with a work unit.
[12]
Relationship with student protesters
[
edit
]
Scholars disagree about whether the BWAF cooperated or clashed with student protesters. Sociologist
Dingxin Zhao
writes that student leaders, including Li Jinjin, a law student at
Peking University
, and
Zhou Yongjun
of the
China University of Political Science and Law
, helped the BWAF by drafting documents and providing legal advice. Students also supplied the Federation with broadcasting equipment and banners. Zhao therefore concludes that the BWAF "was basically only an appendage of the student movement."
[13]
However, Walder and Gong's interviews with former members portray significant friction between the workers and students, suggesting that the two groups had conflicting goals. Particularly, the workers were more critical of economic reforms, and the Communist Party leaders associated with them, than the students were. For example, while many students expressed sympathy toward Zhao Ziyang and the reform faction, especially after Zhao's visit to Tiananmen Square on May 19, the BWAF remained "consistently critical of Zhao Ziyang even after his fall from power."
[10]
In addition, former Federation members felt marginalized by the students' insistence on maintaining the purity of the movement. At least twice in May, students stopped workers from establishing a headquarters in Tiananmen Square. At the end of the month, students finally allowed them to move from the western viewing stand into the square itself.
[14]
Dissolution
[
edit
]
The PLA's armed crackdown against protesters ended the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation's short existence. Late on the evening of June 3, a group of young people escorted BWAF leader
Han Dongfang
away from Tiananmen Square. As the youth tried to persuade him to leave, they compared him to
Polish
Solidarity
leader
Lech Wałęsa
. Han fled on his bicycle to the neighboring
Hebei
province.
[15]
On June 8, the Martial Law Command Headquarters issued a public notice declaring the BWAF was an illegal organization and ordering it to disband. The notice said that Federation leaders were among "the main instigators and organizers in the capital of the
counter-revolutionary
rebellion."
[2]
BWAF members were arrested and imprisoned; after Han turned himself in to police, he was imprisoned for 22 months without trial until he contracted tuberculosis and was released in April 1991.

The men's
coxed four
competition at the
1936 Summer Olympics
in
Berlin
took place are at
Grünau
on the
Langer See
.
[1]
It was held from 12 to 14 August.
[2]
There were 16 boats (80 competitors) from 16 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event.
[2]
The event was won by Germany, the second time the nation had won two consecutive gold medals in the men's coxed four (1900 and 1912 was the first; Switzerland also accomplished the feat in 1920 and 1924). Germany's four gold medals overall was the most any nation won in the event before it was discontinued; four nations (including two German teams, the United Team of Germany and East Germany) won two. Switzerland, which had won three straight medals in the 1920s before not competing in 1932, returned to the podium with a silver medal. Bronze went to France, the nation's first medal in the event since 1924. Both Italy (11th place) and Poland (9th place) had two-Games medal streaks broken.
Background
[
edit
]
This was the seventh appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.
[2]
Six of the seven nations from the 1932 Games returned, with only New Zealand missing; returning nations included gold medallists Germany, silver medallists Italy, and bronze medallists Poland. Switzerland, a perennial contender that had missed the 1932 Games in Los Angeles, competed once again. The favourites were Germany and Switzerland, with Italy also a strong contender.
[2]
Uruguay and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States each made their fifth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.
Competition format
[
edit
]
The coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.
[3]
Despite the field growing from 7 boats in 1932 to 16 in 1936, the tournament continued to use a three-round format: semifinals, repechage, final.
There were three semifinal heats, with 5 or 6 boats each. The winner of each heat (3 boats) advanced directly to the final, while the remainder (13 boats) competed in the repechage.
There were three repechage heats, with 4 or 5 boats each. The winner of each heat (3 boats) advanced to the final; others (10 boats) were eliminated.
There was a single final, with 6 boats, to determine the medals and 4th-6th place.

[1]
[2]
Taxonomy
[
edit
]
It was first
described
in 1946 by the French mycologist
Gilbert Bouriquet
who classified it as
Leucocoprinus tanetensis.
[3]
This species is currently accepted but appears to have received no attention since and may have simply been forgotten about as the publication in which it was described,
Bulletin l’Académie Malgache, Nouvelle série, tome 25
is rare and contains many other species for which there is no information available.
Description
[
edit
]
Leucocoprinus tanetensis
is a large white mushroom with white flesh which does not discolour red. The description for this species more closely resembles a
Chlorophyllum
species so it may be a synonym for another species which has yet to be reclassified.
Cap:
Starts ovoid before spreading out and expanding to 14cm wide, has a slight, broad
umbo
. The surface is creamy white and covered in many brown scales.
Stem:
Over 20cm long and 10mm thick with a bulbous base. It is firm with a white surface and a hollow, fibrous centre. No details of the stem ring are noted besides that it is very developed however the accompanying illustration shows a large ring towards the top of the stem (apical).
Gills:
Free, crowded and whitish but discolouring greenish with age.
Spore print:
Cream.
Spores:
12.5-15.5 x 8.75-12 μm. Dextrinoid. Guttulate with a thick membrane and a very distinct germ pore, very pale yellow.
Smell:
Pleasant.
Taste:
Pleasant.
[3]
Habitat and distribution
[
edit
]
The specimens studied by Bouriquet were found growing in open grassy areas in
Magagascar
near cattle manure and were often found on the low heights known as
tanety
. These mushrooms were found in January near
Antananarivo
and were said to be abundant during this month and common all over the island.
[3]
GBIF
has no recorded observations for this species.
[4]
Etymology
[
edit
]
Tanety
is the local term used to describe hillside areas.
[5]
L. tanetensis
was likely named for this word.
Edibility
[
edit
]
Bouriquet states that this species is one of the best edible mushrooms in Grande-Île,
[3]
which is another name for Madagascar.
[6]
He notes that it was listed as one of the species authorised for sale in Antananarivo.

The Ebony Idol
is a
plantation literature
novel by G. M. Flanders, first published in 1860. It is one of several pro-slavery novels written in the Southern United States in response to the 1852
abolitionist
novel
Uncle Tom's Cabin
by
Harriet Beecher Stowe
.
The majority of these works, such as
Aunt Phillis's Cabin
(1852) and
The Planter's Northern Bride
(1854) attacked Stowe for her allegedly inaccurate depiction of slavery, and criticized other abolitionists.
[1]
[2]
Plot
[
edit
]
The novel takes place in the fictional town of Minton in
New England
, inhabited entirely by white people, and where coloured people are almost unknown.
The local pastor, the Reverend Mr. Cary, converts to the cause of abolitionism, and arranges for a fugitive slave named Caesar to take up residence in the town, to act as an "ebony idol" for the respect and sympathy of the people of Minton.
Cary's social experiment, however, has disastrous consequences. Caesar's presence splits Minton between pro- and anti-slavery factions, and Cary himself is questioned on his motives for keeping Caesar at all. Practically overnight, Minton changes from a quiet paradise into a violent slum.
In time, Cary is visited by a slaveholder from the south, and under pressure from the townsfolk, agrees that Caesar leave Minton to work on the plantations of the South, restoring Minton to its original, idyllic condition.
Publication history
[
edit
]
The Ebony Idol
was published in 1860 by D. Appleton & Co. of New York City.
[3]
Appleton & Co. had been responsible for the publication of several previous anti-Tom novels, including
The Lofty and the Lowly, or Good in All and None All Good
by Maria J. McIntosh in 1853.

. Contrary to popular belief, Töölö is no longer an official name of any district or neighbourhood in Helsinki; in 1959 Töölö was divided into Etu-Töölö and Taka-Töölö.
Overview
[
edit
]
St. Urho's Pub
in Etu-Töölö
Töölö was built in 1920-1930 when Helsinki suffered from rapid population growth and needed more housing. It was the site of the first ever town planning competition in Finland in 1898-1900. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize was awarded to architect Gustaf Nyström (together with engineer Herman Norrmén), second prize to architect
Lars Sonck
, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck together with architects Bertil Jung and Valter Thomé.
[2]
Nyström's scheme represented classicism with wide main streets and imposing public buildings arranged in symmetrical axial compositions, and the other two entries following two picturesque theories of town planning proposed at that time by Viennese city planner
Camillo Sitte
, with the street network adapted to the rocky terrain and with picturesque compositions. Undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nyström and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nyström's spacious street network and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the
Nordic Classicism
style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in a classical style along a curving street line. A still wider (24 metres) new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of
Kallio
, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck, but with further input from Nyström, and completed in around 1923.
[3]
However, despite these wide streets there are also several Sitte-inspired picturesque streets and squares, most notably Temppeliaukio square (in the centre of which is the
"church in the rock")
.
Töölö has always been the most respected as a place to live, but the prices of apartments are high, especially in Etu-Töölö. In Töölö, the marketing times for apartments are clearly shorter and the prices per square meter are therefore higher than in the rest of Helsinki on average, which speaks of abundant demand. A square of living in Töölö costs about €8,000, which is close to the price level of the second most popular district,
Lauttasaari
, but clearly less than in
Ullanlinna
, where a square of living costs closer to €10,000.
[4]
Töölö is also known for its functionalist architecture, notably around Taka-Töölö. There are many parks, including Hesperia Park
[1]
on the Töölö Bay and also
Sibelius Park
, named after composer
Jean Sibelius
and containing a
monument
in his name. Töölö also has a vibrant cultural life, being the location of the
Finnish National Opera
, the
National Museum of Finland
, Kunsthalle Helsinki, the Zoological Museum, Töölö Library, and many small galleries and bookstores. With the
Olympic Stadium
,
Sonera Stadium
, the
Sports Hall
and the
Ice Hall
, all within walking distance from each other, Taka-Töölö is also a significant neighbourhood for sport life in Helsinki.

This article is about the type of cavalry. For infantry armed with an arquebus, see
Arquebusier
.
Harquebusier, carbine-armed cavalry, 17th century
The
harquebusier
was the most common form of
cavalry
found throughout
Western Europe
during the early to mid-
17th century
. Early harquebusiers were characterised by the use of a type of
carbine
called a "harquebus". In England, harquebusier was the technical name for this type of cavalry, though in everyday usage they were usually simply called 'cavalry' or 'horse'. In Germany they were often termed
Ringerpferd
, or sometimes
Reiter
, in Sweden they were called
lätta ryttare
.
[1]
Development
[
edit
]
Gustavus Adolphus
(centre) leading a mixed-cavalry charge, c. 1632. Painting by Jan Martszen de Jonge, 1634
According to John Cruso in his cavalry manual of 1632, the harquebusier was 'first invented in France'.
[2]
This type of cavalryman was characterised by the use of a form of carbine, the earliest type of carbine used was called a "
harquebus
" (a word derived from the heavier infantry weapon, the
arquebus
).  In the late
16th century
and into the first decades of the following century the harquebusier was envisioned, like the similar and earlier
petronel
,
as a support for more heavily-armoured cavalrymen such as the
demi-lancer
, or
pistol
-armed cavalry - the
cuirassier
and
reiter
.
[3]
Towards the mid-17th century, the harquebusier became the standard type of cavalry found throughout western Europe. The change in the role of the harquebusier from support cavalry primarily reliant on firearms to one of
shock-capable
close-combat cavalry can be attributed to
Gustavus Adolphus
of
Sweden
in the 1620s and 1630s. This change was initially made from necessity; Sweden was a relatively poor nation and could not afford to equip many expensive cuirassiers, therefore more lightly-equipped cavalry had to be employed in the shock role.  The success of Swedish cavalry in battle during the
Thirty Years War
led to other nations adopting their methods.
[4]
Gustavus Adolphus also reduced the depth of a cavalry formation from the previous six to ten
ranks
for pistol-based tactics, to three ranks to suit his sword-based shock tactics.
[5]
The later harquebusier was also used in a shock role by cavalry leaders of the
English Civil War
, such as
Prince Rupert of the Rhine
and
Oliver Cromwell
. They employed harquesbusiers very aggressively, charging with sword in hand, thus relegating their firearms to a secondary function.
[6]
Indeed by the 1620s cavalry not equipped with carbines could be termed "harquebusiers", just from the level and style of their armour protection. By the time of the English Civil War all cavalry not equipped as cuirassiers or carrying a
lance
(the Scots fielded light lancers as late as the 1650s) were called harquebusiers. In the course of the war the cuirassier ceased to be fielded in Britain, and when the cuirassier discarded his limb armour he instantly became indistinguishable from the harquebusier.
[7]
[8]
Equipment
[
edit
]
Snaphaunce

c.
1660s
English-made very high quality harquebusier armour of
Pedro II of Portugal
: an engraved
cuirass
, bridle-hand gauntlet,
buff coat
, and 3-barred
lobster tailed pot
helmet
The harquebusier would usually be armed with a
wheellock
,
snaphaunce
or
doglock
flintlock
carbine hung from a swivel attached to a
baldric
, pistols in
saddle
holsters, and a stout, straight-bladed sword.
[9]
The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch used to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe or
pick
, which were hafted weapons with axe or hammer heads and armour-piercing spikes.
[10]
The typical harquebusier would have an iron
cuirass
with a breast and backplate, and an open-faced helmet such as a
lobster-tailed pot
; the fashion-conscious could replace the helmet with a broad-brimmed felt hat, often worn over a concealed iron skullcap or
secrete
. In England, in 1629, a harquebusier's armour cost one pound and six shillings, that of a cuirassier four pounds and ten shillings.
[11]
A more wealthy harquebusier may have worn a
buff coat
(the finest quality buff coats were often more expensive than an iron cuirass) under his armour and a metal
gauntlet
to protect his bridle hand and forearm.
[12]
Also worn were tall, cuff-topped riding boots; these reached the thigh and were often also of buff leather.

(mass-produced) armour at this time was usually of iron, sometimes containing small amounts of phosphorus; this addition gave a minimal increase in hardness. Officers and other wealthy men would have had access to
steel
armour, which was carefully
heat-treated
to harden it.
[14]
[15]
Organisation
[
edit
]
Harquebusiers were organised into
troops
, and a variable number of troops made up a
regiment
. The organisation of the cavalry of the
New Model Army
in England was typical: each troop was ideally composed of 100 cavalrymen commanded by a
captain
, with six troops comprising a regiment under a
colonel
. Regiments were usually named after their colonel, and both the colonel and his second-in-command, the
major
or
sergeant major
, personally led his own troop. When the regimental colonel was also a
general
or had other duties, a 'stand-in' termed a
lieutenant-colonel
was appointed. Numbers of cavalrymen per troop were often lower than the ideal when on campaign and some regiments had more troops than was normal. Prominent commanders also often had a 'lifeguard'; Prince Rupert had a ten-troop regiment plus a lifeguard of 150 men, whilst Oliver Cromwell's regiment had fourteen troops.
[16]
Tactics
[
edit
]
German drill manual for early 17th century harquebusiers
There were national variations in the battlefield employment of harquebusiers. The French tended to retain greater use of firearms, with their harquebusiers often giving a volley of carbine or pistol fire before closing with the sword. The Swedish and
Royalist English
horse charged home directly with the sword, not using firearms until the
melee
. The
Parliamentarian English
cavalry retained the use of firearms in the charge until later in the Civil War, but by the time of the
New Model Army
had largely adopted the direct charge with the sword.
[17]
The Royalists, under Prince Rupert's direction, began the Civil War using the Swedish three ranks-deep formation but the Parliamentarians retained a six-deep formation until late 1643 or early 1644. A cavalry unit drawn up in a shallow formation would
outflank
a similar-sized unit arrayed in a deep formation, a considerable tactical advantage.
[18]
The Swedes and Royalist horse usually charged at speed, while the Parliamentarian
Ironsides
charged at a slower pace, the troopers keeping together knee-to-knee in order to retain their formation.
[19]
[20]
In England many harquebusiers did not employ a carbine, as is described in
Militaire Discipline
of 1661:
Many troops and regiments only with sword and pistol armed, their encounterings being not after the ancient manner of firing at a distance and wheeling off, which hath been found to be of dangerous consequence, but to fire at near distance their swords hanging at their wrists by a string, and with their sword points charging through adverse troops.
[21]
Demise
[
edit
]
Victorian
painting of a harquebusier. The image is intended to show  a soldier of the late 17th century, though the equipment is more typical of early 17th: a wheelock carbine, a cuirass over a buff coat, and an old-fashioned
burgonet
helmet.
The term
harquebusier
fell out of use gradually, as armour use declined and the fully-armoured cuirassier disappeared. Harquebusiers became part of the undifferentiated "horse" or, in French, "cavalerie", of the early to mid-
18th century
. In the British army many cavalry regiments having their origins as units of harquebusiers eventually transformed into
dragoons
. In the last two decades of the 17th century, the use of armour and the buff coat declined and helmets were definitively replaced by felt hats and uniform coats. As an example, all items of armour previously employed by the regiment of Oxford Blues (precursor of the
Royal Horse Guards
) were ordered to be put in store in 1688 before the regiment went on active service.
[22]
The equipment of the harquebusier disappeared at different rates; the doglock carbine was replaced by the 'true'
flintlock
in the late 17th century.
Cuirasses
fell in and out of fashion during the 18th century, before the Napoleonic renaissance of the later type of cuirassier in the first decade of the
19th century
. The lobster-tailed pot helmet fell out of favour in most countries by 1700, though the Austrian army retained this type of helmet for its cuirassiers into the 1780s, especially when campaigning against the Ottoman Turks.
