The size of Africa compared to the other continents
Africa
is the world's second-largest and second-most populous
continent
, after
Asia
in both aspects. At about 30.3 million km
2
(11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of
Earth
's land area and 6% of its total surface area.
[7]
With 1.4 billion people
[1]
[2]
as of 2021, it accounts for about
18% of the world's
human population
. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;
[8]
[9]
the
median
age in 2012 was 19.7,   when the worldwide median age was 30.4.
[10]
Despite a wide range of
natural resources
, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of
Oceania
. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate,
tribalism
,
[11]
colonialism
, the
Cold War
,
[12]
[13]
neocolonialism
, lack of
democracy
, and
corruption
.
[11]
Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.
The continent is surrounded by the
Mediterranean Sea
to the north, the
Isthmus of Suez
and the
Red Sea
to the northeast, the
Indian Ocean
to the southeast and the
Atlantic Ocean
to the west. The continent includes
Madagascar
and various
archipelagos
. It contains
54 fully recognised sovereign states
, eight
cities and islands that are part of non-African states
, and two
de facto
independent
states with limited or no recognition
. This count does not include
Malta
and
Sicily
, which are geologically part of the African continent.
Algeria
is Africa's largest country by area, and
Nigeria
is its largest by population. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the
African Union
, which is headquartered in
Addis Ababa
.
Africa straddles the
equator
and the
prime meridian
. It is the only continent to stretch from the northern
temperate
to the southern temperate zones.
[14]
The majority of the continent and its countries are in the
Northern Hemisphere
, with a substantial portion and a number of countries in the
Southern Hemisphere
. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of
Western Sahara
,
Algeria
,
Libya
and
Egypt
, the northern tip of
Mauritania
, and the entire territories of
Morocco
,
Ceuta
,
Melilla
, and
Tunisia
which in turn are located above the
tropic of Cancer
, in the
northern temperate zone
. In the other extreme of the continent, southern
Namibia
, southern
Botswana
, great parts of
South Africa
, the entire territories of
Lesotho
and
Eswatini
and the southern tips of
Mozambique
and Madagascar are located below the
tropic of Capricorn
, in the
southern temperate zone
.
Africa is highly
biodiverse
;
[15]
it is the continent with the largest number of
megafauna
species, as it was least affected by the
extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna
. However, Africa also is
heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues
, including desertification, deforestation,
water scarcity
and
pollution
. These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as
climate change impacts Africa
. The UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
has identified Africa as the continent most
vulnerable to climate change
.
[16]
[17]
The
history of Africa
is long, complex, and has often been under-appreciated by the global
historical community
.
[18]
Africa, particularly
Eastern Africa
, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the
Hominidae
clade
(
great apes
). The earliest
hominids
and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including
Sahelanthropus tchadensis
,
Australopithecus africanus
,
A. afarensis
,
Homo erectus
,
H. habilis
and
H. ergaster
—the earliest
Homo sapiens
(modern human) remains, found in
Ethiopia
,
South Africa
, and
Morocco
, date to circa 233,000, 259,000, and 300,000 years ago, respectively, and
Homo sapiens
is believed to have originated in Africa around 350,000-260,000 years ago.
[a]
Africa is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited.
[25]
[26]
[27]
Early human civilizations, such as
Ancient Egypt
and
Carthage
emerged in
North Africa
. Following a subsequent
long and complex history of civilizations
, migration and trade, Africa hosts a large diversity of
ethnicities
,
cultures
and
languages
. The last 400 years have witnessed an increasing
European
influence on the continent. Starting in the 16th century, this was driven by trade, including the
Trans-Atlantic slave trade
, which created large
African diaspora
populations in the Americas. From the
late 19th century
to  the early 20th century, European nations colonized almost all of Africa, reaching a point when only
Ethiopia
and
Liberia
were independent polities.
[28]
Most present states in Africa emerged from a process of
decolonisation
following
World War II
.
Etymology
The totality of Africa seen by the
Apollo 17
crew
Afri
was a
Latin
name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the
Nile
river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the
Mediterranean
(
Ancient Libya
).
[29]
[30]
This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern
Berbers
; see
Terence
for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the
Phoenician
word
ʿafar
meaning "dust",
[31]
but a 1981 hypothesis
[32]
has asserted that it stems from the
Berber
word
ifri
(plural
ifran
) meaning  "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.
[33]
The same word
[33]
may be found in the name of the
Banu Ifran
from
Algeria
and
Tripolitania
, a Berber tribe originally from
Yafran
(also known as
Ifrane
) in northwestern Libya,
[34]
as well as the city of
Ifrane
in Morocco.
Under
Roman
rule,
Carthage
became the capital of the province it then named
Africa Proconsularis
, following its defeat of the
Carthaginians
in the
Third Punic War
in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern
Libya
.
[35]
The Latin suffix
-ica
can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in
Celtica
from
Celtae
, as used by
Julius Caesar
). The later Muslim region of
Ifriqiya
, following its conquest of the
Byzantine (Eastern Roman)
Empire's
Exarchatus Africae
, also preserved a form of the name.
According to the Romans, Africa lies to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to
Anatolia
and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer
Ptolemy
(85-165 CE), indicating
Alexandria
along the
Prime Meridian
and making the isthmus of Suez and the
Red Sea
the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.
Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
The 1st-century Jewish historian
Flavius Josephus
(
Ant. 1.15
) asserted that it was named for
Epher
, grandson of
Abraham
according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
Isidore of Seville
in his 7th-century
Etymologiae
XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the Latin
aprica
, meaning "sunny".
Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian
af-rui-ka
, meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The
Ka
is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."
[36]
Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed
[37]
linking the Latin word with
africus
"south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
Robert R. Stieglitz of
Rutgers University
in 1984 proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew
Ophir
['rich']."
[38]
Ibn Khallikan
and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a
Himyarite
king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called "Afrikus son of Abraham" who subdued Ifriqiya.
[39]
[40]
[41]
Arabic
afrīqā
(feminine noun) and
ifrīqiyā
, now usually pronounced
afrīqiyā
(feminine) 'Africa', from
‘afara
[‘ =
‘ain
, not
’alif
] 'to be dusty' from
‘afar
'dust, powder' and
‘afir
'dried, dried up by the sun, withered' and
‘affara
'to dry in the sun on hot sand' or 'to sprinkle with dust'.
[42]
Possibly Phoenician
faraqa
in the sense of 'colony, separation'.

Africa is considered by most
paleoanthropologists
to be the
oldest inhabited territory
on Earth, with the Human species originating from the continent.
[44]
During the mid-20th century,
anthropologists
discovered many
fossils
and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (
Before present
, BP). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have
evolved
into modern man, such as
Australopithecus afarensis
radiometrically dated
to approximately 3.9-3.0 million years BP,
[45]
Paranthropus boisei
(c. 2.3-1.4 million years BP)
[46]
and
Homo ergaster
(c. 1.9 million-600,000 years BP) have been discovered.
[7]
After the evolution of
Homo sapiens
approximately 350,000 to 260,000 years BP in Africa,
[20]
[21]
[22]
[23]
the continent was mainly populated by groups of
hunter-gatherers
.
[47]
[48]
These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the
globe
during the
Out of Africa II
migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across
Bab-el-Mandeb
over the
Red Sea
,
[49]
[50]
the
Strait of Gibraltar
in Morocco,
[51]
[52]
or the
Isthmus of Suez
in Egypt.
[53]
Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the
Sahara
.
[54]
Emergence of civilization

Cradle of civilization § Ancient Egypt
The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.
[55]
At the end of the
Ice ages
, estimated to have been around 10,500 BCE, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in
sub-Saharan Africa
, with
rock art paintings
depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in
Tassili n'Ajjer
dating back perhaps 10 millennia.
[56]
However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the Earth's
orbit
, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.
[57]
The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the
Second Cataract
where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and
Eastern Africa
. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in
Ethiopia
.

The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.
[58]
In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to
Nubia
.
Between 10,000 and 9,000 BC, pottery was independently invented in the region of Mali in the savannah of West Africa.
[59]
[60]
In the
steppes
and
savannahs
of the Sahara and
Sahel
in Northern West Africa, people possibly ancestral to modern
Nilo-Saharan
and
Mandé
cultures started to collect wild
millet
,
[61]
around 8000 to 6000 BCE. Later,
gourds
,
watermelons
,
castor beans
, and
cotton
were also collected.
[62]
Sorghum was first domesticated in Eastern
Sudan
around 4000 BC, in one of the earliest instances of agriculture in human history. Its cultivation would gradually spread across Africa, before spreading to India around 2000 BC.
[63]
[64]
Colossal statues of
Ramesses II
at
Abu Simbel
,
Egypt
, date from around 1250 BC.
People around modern-day Mauritania started making
pottery
and built stone settlements (e.g.,
Tichitt
,
Oualata
). Fishing, using bone-tipped
harpoons
, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains.
[65]
In West Africa, the wet phase ushered in an expanding
rainforest
and wooded savanna from
Senegal
to
Cameroon
. Between 9,000 and 5,000 BC,
Niger-Congo speakers
domesticated the
oil palm
and
raffia palm
.
Black-eyed peas
and
voandzeia
(African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by
okra
and
kola nuts
. Since most of the plants grew in the forest, the Niger-Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.
[66]
Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.
[67]
This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing
desertification
. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and encouraged migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.
[67]
During the first millennium BC, a reduction in wild grain populations related to changing climate conditions facilitated the expansion of farming communities and the rapid adoption of rice cultivation around the Niger River.
[68]
[69]
By the first millennium BC,
ironworking
had been introduced in Northern Africa. Around that time it also became established in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, either through independent invention there or diffusion from the north
[70]
[71]
and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years,
[72]
and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa.
Ironworking
was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions did not begin ironworking until the early centuries CE. Copper objects from
Egypt
, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that
Trans-Saharan trade
networks had been established by this date.
[67]
Early civilizations

At about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the
Pharaonic
civilization of
ancient Egypt
.
[73]
One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.
[74]
[75]
Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day
Libya
and
Nubia
, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.
[76]
An independent centre of
civilization
with trading links to
Phoenicia
was established by
Phoenicians
from
Tyre
on the north-west African coast at Carthage.
[77]
[78]
[79]
European exploration of Africa
began with the
ancient Greeks
and
Romans
.
[80]
[81]
In 332 BC,
Alexander the Great
was welcomed as a liberator in
Persian-occupied Egypt
. He founded
Alexandria
in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the
Ptolemaic dynasty
after his death.

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean
coastline
by the
Roman Empire
, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system.
Roman settlement
occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first
Roman emperor
native to North Africa was
Septimius Severus
, born in
Leptis Magna
in present-day Libya - his mother was Italian Roman and his father was
Punic
.
[83]
Christianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;
[84]
by 340 AD at the latest, it had become the
state religion
of the
Aksumite Empire
.
Syro-Greek missionaries
, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.
[85]
In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic
Caliphate
expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local
Berber
elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from
Syria
to
Qayrawan
in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.
[86]
In West Africa,
Dhar Tichitt
and
Oualata
in present-day
Mauritania
figure prominently among the early urban centers, dated to 2,000 BC. About 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. It has been found by Augustin Holl that the
Soninke
of the
Mandé peoples
were likely responsible for constructing such settlements. Around 300 BCE, the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to
Koumbi Saleh
.
[87]
Architectural evidence and the comparison of pottery styles suggest that Dhar Tichitt was related to the subsequent
Ghana Empire
.
Djenné-Djenno
(in present-day
Mali
) was settled around 300 BC, and the town grew to house a sizable
Iron Age
population, as evidenced by crowded cemeteries. Living structures were made of sun-dried mud. By 250 BCE,
Djenné-Djenno
had become a large, thriving market town.
[88]
[89]
Further south, in central
Nigeria
, around 1,500 BC, the
Nok culture
developed on the
Jos Plateau
. It was a highly centralized community. The Nok people produced lifelike representations in
terracotta
, including human heads and human figures, elephants, and other animals. By 500 BC, and possibly earlier, they were smelting iron. By 200 AD, the Nok culture had vanished.
[71]
and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years. Based on stylistic similarities with the
Nok terracottas
, the bronze figurines of the
Yoruba
kingdom of
Ife
and those of the
Bini
kingdom of
Benin
are suggested to be continuations of the traditions of the earlier Nok culture.

Medieval and early modern Africa
The intricate 9th-century bronzes from
Igbo-Ukwu
, in
Nigeria
displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.
[91]
Pre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities
[92]
characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the
San people
of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the
Bantu-speaking
peoples
of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the
Horn of Africa
; the large
Sahelian kingdoms
; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the
Akan
;
Edo
,
Yoruba
, and
Igbo people
in West Africa; and the
Swahili
coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.
By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest
Hausa
states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were
Ghana
,
Gao
, and the
Kanem-Bornu Empire
.
Ghana
declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the
Mali Empire
which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.
In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the
Muslim
north. The
Kingdom of Nri
was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the
Eze Nri
. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate
bronzes
, found at the town of
Igbo-Ukwu
. The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.
[93]
The
Kingdom of Ife
, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly
oba
('king' or 'ruler' in the
Yoruba language
), called the
Ooni of Ife
. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the
Oyo Empire
, where its obas or kings, called the
Alaafins of Oyo
, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the
Fon
Kingdom of
Dahomey
was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.

The
Almoravids
were a
Berber
dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.
[94]
The
Banu Hilal
and
Banu Ma'qil
were a collection of
Arab
Bedouin
tribes from the
Arabian Peninsula
who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their
migration
resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were
Arabized
,
[95]
and
Arab
culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.
[96]
Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named
Sonni Ali
(1464-1492) founded the
Songhai Empire
in the region of middle
Niger
and the western
Sudan
and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized
Timbuktu
in 1468 and
Jenne
in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor
Askia Mohammad I
(1493-1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.
[97]
By the eleventh century, some
Hausa
states - such as
Kano
,
jigawa
,
Katsina
, and
Gobir
- had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing
caravans
, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.

Indian Ocean slave trade
Major slave trading regions of Africa, 15th-19th centuries.
Slavery
had long been practiced in Africa.
[98]
[99]
Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7-12 million slaves to the New World.
[100]
[101]
[102]
In addition, more than 1 million Europeans were captured by
Barbary pirates
and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.
[103]
In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the
New World
, increasing
anti-slavery
legislation in Europe and America, and the
British Royal Navy's
increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British
West Africa Squadron
seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.
[104]
Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of
Lagos
", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.
[105]
The largest powers of West Africa (the
Asante Confederacy
, the
Kingdom of Dahomey
, and the
Oyo Empire
) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of "legitimate commerce" in the form of
palm oil
,
cocoa
, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.

Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913
These paragraphs are an excerpt from
Scramble for Africa
.
[
]
The
Scramble for Africa
[b]
, as used by historians, describes the invasion, annexation, division, and
colonization of most of Africa
by seven
Western European
powers during an era known as "
New Imperialism
" (between 1833 and 1914). The 10 percent of Africa that was under formal European control in 1870 increased to almost 90 percent by 1914, with only
Liberia
and
Ethiopia
remaining independent.
[107]
The
Berlin Conference
of 1884, which regulated
European colonization
and trade in Africa, is usually accepted as the beginning.
[108]
In the last quarter of the 19th century, there were considerable political rivalries between the
European empires
, which provided the impetus for the Scramble.
[109]
The later years of the 19th century saw a transition from "
informal imperialism
" - military influence and economic dominance - to direct rule.
[110]
Most of Africa
was decolonised
during the
Cold War
period. However, the old imperial boundaries and economic systems imposed by the Scramble still affect
the politics
and
economy of African
nations to today.
[111]

Independent
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of
World War II
, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.
Independence movements in Africa
gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956,
Tunisia
and
Morocco
won their independence from France.
[112]
Ghana
followed suit the next year (March 1957),
[113]
becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.
Portugal's overseas presence in
sub-Saharan Africa
(most notably in
Angola
, Cape Verde,
Mozambique
,
Guinea-Bissau
, and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the
Estado Novo
regime was overthrown in
a military coup in Lisbon
.
Rhodesia
unilaterally declared independence
from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the
white minority
government of
Ian Smith
, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as
Zimbabwe
) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a
bitter guerrilla war
. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of
racial segregation
known as
apartheid
until 1994.

, and
Non-Aligned Movement
Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since independence, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the
presidential system
of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis - per the criteria laid out by Lührmann et al. (2018), only
Botswana
and
Mauritius
have been consistently democratic for the entirety of their post-colonial history. Most African countries have experienced several
coups
or periods of
military dictatorship
. Between 1990 and 2018, though, the continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic governance.
[114]
Upon independence an overwhelming majority of Africans lived in
extreme poverty
. The continent suffered from the lack of infrastructural or industrial development under
colonial
rule, along with political instability. With limited financial resources or access to global markets, relatively stable countries such as
Kenya
still experienced only very slow economic development. Only a handful of African countries succeeded in obtaining rapid economic growth prior to 1990. Exceptions include Libya and Equatorial Guinea, both of which possess large oil reserves.
Instability throughout the continent after decolonization resulted primarily from
marginalization of ethnic groups
, and
corruption
. In pursuit of personal
political gain
, many leaders deliberately promoted ethnic conflicts, some of which had originated during the colonial period, such as from the grouping of multiple unrelated ethnic groups into a single colony, the splitting of a distinct ethnic group between multiple colonies, or existing conflicts being exacerbated by colonial rule (for instance, the preferential treatment given to ethnic
Hutus
over
Tutsis
in Rwanda during German and Belgian rule).
Faced with increasingly frequent and severe violence, military rule was widely accepted by the population of many countries as means to maintain order, and during the 1970s and 1980s a majority of African countries were controlled by
military dictatorships
. Territorial disputes between nations and rebellions by groups seeking independence were also common in independent African states. The most devastating of these was the
Nigerian Civil War
, fought between government forces and an
Igbo
separatist republic
, which resulted in a famine that killed 1-2 million people. Two
civil wars
in Sudan,
the first
lasting from 1955 to 1972 and
the second
from 1983 to 2005, collectively killed around 3 million. Both were fought primarily on ethnic and religious lines.
Cold War
conflicts between the United States and the
Soviet Union
also contributed to instability. Both the Soviet Union and the United States offered considerable incentives to African political and military leaders who aligned themselves with the superpowers' foreign policy. As an example, during the
Angolan Civil War
, the Soviet and Cuban aligned
MPLA
and the American aligned
UNITA
received the vast majority of their military and political support from these countries. Many African countries became highly dependent on foreign aid. The sudden loss of both Soviet and American aid at the end of the Cold War and
fall of the USSR
resulted in severe economic and political turmoil in the countries most dependent on foreign support.
There was a
major famine in Ethiopia
between 1983 and 1985, killing up to 1.2 million people, which most
historians
attribute primarily to the forced relocation of farmworkers and seizure of grain by communist
Derg
government, further exacerbated by the
civil war
.
[115]
[116]
[117]
[118]
In 1994 a
genocide in Rwanda
resulted in up to 800,000 deaths, added to
a severe refugee crisis
and fueled the rise of militia groups in neighboring countries. This contributed to the outbreak of the
first
and
second
Congo Wars, which were the most devastating military conflicts in modern Africa, with up to 5.5 million deaths,
[119]
making it by far the deadliest conflict in modern African history and one of the
costliest wars in human history
.

Various conflicts between various insurgent groups and governments continue. Since 2003 there has been an ongoing
conflict in Darfur
(Sudan) which peaked in intensity from 2003 to 2005 with notable spikes in violence in 2007 and 2013-15, killing around 300,000 people total. The
Boko Haram Insurgency
primarily within Nigeria (with considerable fighting in Niger, Chad, and Cameroon as well) has killed around 350,000 people since 2009. Most African conflicts have been reduced to low-intensity conflicts as of 2022. However, the
Tigray War
which began in 2020 has killed an estimated 300,000-500,000 people, primarily due to
famine
.
Overall though, violence across Africa has greatly declined in the 21st century, with the end of civil wars in Angola,
Sierra Leone
, and
Algeria
in 2002,
Liberia
in 2003, and
Sudan
and
Burundi
in 2005. The Second Congo War, which involved 9 countries and several insurgent groups, ended in 2003. This decline in violence coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms, which over the course of the 1990s and 2000s promoted the establishment of permanent, peaceful trade between neighboring countries (see
Capitalist peace
).
Improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,
[121]
which further spurred economic growth. Between 2000 and 2014, annual GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa averaged 5.02%, doubling its total GDP from $811 Billion to $1.63 Trillion (Constant 2015
USD
).
[122]
North Africa experienced comparable growth rates.
[123]
A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.
[124]
While several individual countries have maintained high growth rates, since 2014 overall growth has considerably slowed, primarily as a result of falling commodity prices, continued lack of
industrialization
, and epidemics of
Ebola
and
COVID-19
.

Geology, geography, ecology, and environment
Main article:
Geography of Africa
Topography of Africa
Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest
landmass
of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the
Mediterranean Sea
, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the
Isthmus of Suez
(transected by the
Suez Canal
), 163 km (101 mi) wide.
[127]
(
Geopolitically
, Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula
east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)
[128]
The coastline is 26,000 km (16,000 mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000 km
2
(4,000,000 sq mi) - about a third of the surface of Africa - has a coastline of 32,000 km (20,000 mi).
[129]
From the most northerly point,
Ras ben Sakka
in Tunisia (37°21' N), to the most southerly point,
Cape Agulhas
in South Africa (34°51'15" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000 km (5,000 mi).
[130]
Cape Verde
, 17°33'22" W, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,400 km (4,600 mi) to
Ras Hafun
, 51°27'52" E, the most easterly projection that neighbours
Cape Guardafui
, the tip of the Horn of Africa.
[129]
Africa's largest country is Algeria, and its smallest country is
Seychelles
, an
archipelago
off the east coast.
[131]
The smallest nation on the continental mainland is
The Gambia

African plate
Today, the African Plate is moving over Earth's surface at a speed of 0.292° ± 0.007° per million years, relative to the "average" Earth (NNR-MORVEL56)
This section is an excerpt from
African Plate
.
[
]
The
African Plate
, also known as the Nubian Plate, is a
major tectonic plate
that includes much of the
continent
of Africa (except for its
easternmost part
) and the adjacent oceanic crust to the west and south. It is bounded by the
North American Plate
and
South American Plate
to the west (separated by the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge
); the
Arabian Plate
and
Somali Plate
to the east; the
Eurasian Plate
,
Aegean Sea Plate
and
Anatolian Plate
to the north; and the
Antarctic Plate
to the south.
Between
million years ago
and
million years ago
, the
Somali Plate
began
rifting
from the African Plate along the
East African Rift
.
[132]
Since the continent of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the
Nubian Plate
to distinguish it from the continent as a whole.
[133]
Climate
Main article:
Climate of Africa
The climate of Africa ranges from
tropical
to
subarctic
on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily
desert
, or
arid
, while its central and southern areas contain both
savanna
plains and dense
jungle
(rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as
sahel
and
steppe
dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on Earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.
[134]
The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in
Libya
in 1922 (58 °C (136 °F)), was discredited in 2013.
[135]
[136]
Ecology and biodiversity
The main biomes in Africa.
Africa has over 3,000
protected areas
, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and
arable land
. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.
[134]
Deforestation
is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (
UNEP
).
[137]
According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.
[134]
Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.
[138]
Over 90% of
Madagascar
's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.
[139]
About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from
soil degradation
.

Environmental issues

Environmental issues in Africa
.
[
]
African environmental issues
are caused by
human impacts on the natural environment
and affect humans and nearly all forms of life. Issues include
deforestation
,
soil degradation
, air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution,
climate change
and
water scarcity
(resulting in problems with access to safe
water supply and sanitation
).
[141]
These issues result in
environmental conflict
and are connected to broader social struggles for democracy and sovereignty.
[142]
Water resources
See also:
Water scarcity in Africa
and
Water supply and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa
Water development and
management
are complex in Africa due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (
rivers
,
lakes
and
aquifers
).
[143]
Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 international
river basin
catchments that traverse multiple borders.
[144]
[143]
This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area's water resources.
[143]
A multi-sectoral analysis of the
Zambezi River
, for example, shows that
riparian
cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments.
[144]
[143]
A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the
Southern African Development Community
(SADC) Protocol,
Volta River Authority
and the
Nile Basin Commission
.
[143]
However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.

Climate change in Africa

[

Climate change in Africa
is an increasingly serious threat as Africa is among the most
vulnerable
continents to the
effects of climate change
.
[145]
[146]
[147]
Some sources even classify Africa as "the most vulnerable continent on Earth".
[148]
[149]
This vulnerability is driven by a range of factors that include weak
adaptive capacity
, high dependence on ecosystem goods for livelihoods, and less developed agricultural production systems.
[150]
The risks of climate change on
agricultural production
,
food security
,
water resources
and
ecosystem services
will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and
sustainable development
prospects in Africa.
[146]
With high confidence, it was projected by the
IPCC
in 2007 that in many African countries and regions, agricultural production and
food security
would probably be severely compromised by climate change and climate variability.
[151]
Managing this risk requires an integration of
mitigation
and
adaptation strategies
in the management of ecosystem goods and services, and the agriculture production systems in Africa.
[152]
Over the coming decades, warming from climate change is expected across almost all the Earth's surface, and global mean rainfall will increase.
[153]
Currently, Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world on average. Large portions of the continent may become uninhabitable as a result of the rapid effects of climate change, which would have disastrous effects on human health, food security, and poverty.
[154]
[155]
[156]
Regional effects on rainfall in the tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable and the sign of change at any one location is often less certain, although changes are expected. Consistent with this, observed
surface temperatures
have generally increased over Africa since the late 19th century to the early 21st century by about 1 °C, but locally as much as 3 °C for minimum temperature in the Sahel at the end of the dry season.
[157]
Observed precipitation trends indicate spatial and temporal discrepancies as expected.
[158]
[146]
The observed changes in temperature and
precipitation
vary regionally.

Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of
wild animal
populations and diversity, with wild populations of large
carnivores
(such as lions,
hyenas
, and cheetahs) and
herbivores
(such as
buffalo
, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including snakes and
primates
and
aquatic life
such as crocodiles and
amphibians
. In addition, Africa has the largest number of

species, as it was least affected by the
extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna

The
African Union
(AU) is a
continental union
consisting of 55
member states
. The union was formed, with
Addis Ababa
, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002
[160]
as a successor to the
Organisation of African Unity
(OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's
Pan-African Parliament
(PAP) was relocated to
Midrand
, in South Africa, but the
African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights
remained in Addis Ababa.
The African Union, not to be confused with the
AU Commission
, is formed by the
Constitutive Act of the African Union
, which aims to transform the
African Economic Community
, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the
African Union Government
, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the
Pan-African Parliament
. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the
Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament
, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the
OAU
Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union, regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.
Extensive
human rights abuses
still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
,
Sierra Leone
,
Liberia
,
Sudan
,
Zimbabwe
, and
Ivory Coast
.

African states have made great efforts to respect interstate borders as inviolate for a long time. For example, the
Organization of African Unity
(OAU), which was established in 1963 and replaced by the
African Union
in 2002, set the respect for the territorial integrity of each state as one of its principles in OAU Charter.
[161]
Indeed, compared with the formation of European states, there have been fewer interstate conflicts in Africa for changing the borders, which has influenced the state formation there and has enabled some states to survive that might have been defeated and absorbed by others.
[162]
Yet interstate conflicts have played out by support for proxy armies or rebel movements. Many states have experienced civil wars: including Rwanda, Sudan, Angola, Sierra Leone, Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia and Somalia.

Although it has abundant
natural resources
, Africa remains the world's poorest and
least-developed
continent (other than
Antarctica
), the result of a variety of causes that may include
corrupt governments
that have often committed serious
human rights violations
, failed
central planning
, high levels of
illiteracy
, low self-esteem, lack of access to foreign capital, legacies of colonialism, the
slave
trade, and the Cold War, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from
guerrilla warfare
to
genocide
).
[164]
Its total nominal GDP remains behind that of the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, India and France. According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.
[165]
Poverty
, illiteracy,
malnutrition
and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the
World Bank
[166]
announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). Eighty-one percent of the
sub-Saharan African
population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 86% for India.
[167]
Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of
the population living in poverty
in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,
[168]
indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.
[169]
[170]
Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries. The last debt
crisis
in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC). The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa. About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into debt. A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.
[171]
From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably
Angola
,
Sudan
and
Equatorial Guinea
, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their
oil extraction
capacity.
In a recently published analysis based on
World Values Survey
data, the Austrian political scientist Arno Tausch maintained that several African countries, most notably
Ghana
, perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the
market economy
.

As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the
food security crisis of 2008
which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.
[178]
In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.
[121]
A Harvard University study led by professor
Calestous Juma
showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."

Electricity generation
The main source of
electricity
is
hydropower
, which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy.

Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and is consequently relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.
[181]
The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.
[182]
As of 2021, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.4 billion
[1]
[2]
. Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time - India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.
[183]
This increase in number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050; while in 1990 sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 16% of the world's births.
[184]
The
total fertility rate
(children per woman) for Sub-Saharan Africa is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world.
[185]
All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had
TFRs
(average number of children) above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27.1% of
global
livebirths.
[186]
In 2021, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 29% of global births.
[187]
Speakers of
Bantu languages
(part of the
Niger-Congo
family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from
the Sahel
progressively expanded over most of sub-Saharan Africa.
[188]
But there are also several
Nilotic
groups in
South Sudan
and East Africa, the mixed
Swahili people
on the
Swahili Coast
, and a few remaining
indigenous
Khoisan ("
San"
or "Bushmen") and
Pygmy peoples
in Southern and Central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the
Kalahari Desert
of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "
Hottentots
") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa.

Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.
[189]
The peoples of West Africa primarily speak
Niger-Congo languages

Nilo-Saharan
and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger-Congo-speaking
Yoruba
,
Igbo
,

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century CE introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic
Phoenicians
(who founded
Carthage
) and
Hyksos
, the Indo-Iranian
Alans
, the Indo- European
Greeks
, Romans, and
Vandals
settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within
Morocco
and
Algeria
in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.
[190]
The Berber-speaking
Tuareg
and other often-
nomadic
peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger-Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.
[191]
In the
Horn of Africa
, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the
Amhara
and
Tigrayans
, collectively known as
Habesha
) speak languages from the
Semitic
branch of the
Afro-Asiatic
language family, while the
Oromo
and
Somali
speak languages from the
Cushitic
branch of Afro-Asiatic.
Prior to the
decolonization
movements of the post-World War II era,
Europeans
were represented in every part of Africa.
[192]
Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers - especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million
pieds-noirs
in North Africa),
[193]
Kenya, Congo,
[194]
Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.
[195]
Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.
[196]
Nevertheless,
white Africans
remain an important minority in many African states, particularly
Zimbabwe
,
Namibia
,
Réunion
, and
South Africa
.
[197]
The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.
[198]
Dutch
and
British
diasporas
represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.
[199]
European colonization also brought sizable groups of
Asians
, particularly from the
Indian subcontinent
, to British colonies. Large
Indian communities
are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large
Indian community in Uganda
was
expelled
by the dictator
Idi Amin
in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The
Malagasy people
of Madagascar are an
Austronesian people
, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as
Cape Coloureds
(people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of
Lebanese
and
Chinese
[121]
have also developed in the larger coastal cities of
West
and East Africa, respectively.

Religion in Africa
See also:
African divination
While Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, the majority of the people respect African religions or parts of them. However, in formal surveys or census, most people will identify with major religions that came from outside the continent, mainly through colonisation. There are several reasons for this, the main one being the colonial idea that African religious beliefs and practices are not good enough. Religious beliefs and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations.
[206]
[207]
According to the
World Book Encyclopedia
,
Islam
and
Christianity
are the two largest religions in Africa. According to
Encyclopædia Britannica
, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow
traditional religions
.

Writing systems of Africa § Indigenous writing systems
By most estimates, well over a thousand
languages
(
UNESCO
has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.
[208]
Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most
multilingual
continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well.
[
further explanation needed
]
There are four major groups indigenous to Africa:
A simplistic view of language families spoken in Africa
The
Afroasiatic
languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the
Sahel
, and Southwest Asia.
The
Nilo-Saharan
languages consist of a group of several possibly related
families
,
[209]
spoken by 30 million people between 100 languages. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in
Chad
,
Ethiopia
,
Kenya
,
Nigeria
,
Sudan
,
South Sudan
,
Uganda
, and northern
Tanzania
.
The
Niger-Congo
language family covers much of sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps one of the largest in the world.
The
Khoisan
languages form a group of three unrelated
[210]
families and two
isolates
and number about fifty in total. They are mainly spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 400,000 people.
[211]
Many of the Khoisan languages are
endangered
. The
Khoi
and
San
peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.
Following the end of
colonialism
, nearly all African countries adopted
official languages
that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as
Swahili
,
Yoruba
,
Igbo
and
Hausa
). In numerous countries, English and French (
see
African French
) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic,
Portuguese
,
Afrikaans
and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former
Italian colonies
in Africa. German is spoken in
Namibia
, as it was a former German protectorate. In total, at least a fifth of Africans speak the former colonial languages.

More than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The
Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the African Decade on
African traditional medicine
in an effort to promote The WHO African Region's adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.
[215]
Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.
[216]
AIDS in post-colonial Africa
is a prevalent issue. Although the continent is home to about 15.2 percent of the world's population,
[217]
more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide - some 35 million people - were Africans, of whom 15 million have already died.
[218]
Sub-Saharan Africa
alone accounted for an estimated 69 percent of all people living with HIV
[219]
and 70 percent of all AIDS deaths in 2011.
[220]
In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa most affected, AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years.
[218]
Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of Africa has declined, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.
[221]
Culture
Main article:
Culture of Africa
The
Senegambian stone circles
, lying in The
Gambia
and
Senegal

.
Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.
[222]
Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.
[222]
Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.
[223]
According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, "The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art."
[224]
Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects "lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.
[224]
Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that "the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art."
[225]
Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the "traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe."
[226]
On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)assert themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies."
[227]
There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the
African Renaissance
, led by
Thabo Mbeki
,
Afrocentrism
, led by a group of scholars, including
Molefi Asante
, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of
Vodou
and other forms of spirituality.
As of March 2023, 98 African properties are listed by
UNESCO
as
World Heritage Sites
. Among these proprieties, 54 are cultural sites, 39 are natural sites and 5 are mixed sites. The
List Of World Heritage in Danger
includes 15 African sites.

These paragraphs are an excerpt from
African art

[
]
African art
describes the modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other
visual culture
from native or indigenous
Africans
and the
African continent
. The definition may also include the art of the
African diasporas
, such as:
African-American
,
Caribbean
or art in
South American
societies inspired by African traditions. Despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.
[229]
Pottery
,
metalwork
,
sculpture
,
architecture
,
textile art
and fiber art are important visual art forms across Africa and may be included in the study of African art. The term "African art" does not usually include the art of the
North African
areas along the
Mediterranean
coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions. For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of
Berber
or
Islamic art
, although with many particular local characteristics.
The
Art of Ethiopia
, with a long
Christian tradition
,
[230]
is also different from that of most of Africa, where the
Traditional African religion
(with
Islam
in the north) was dominant until the 20th century.
[231]
African art includes
prehistoric
and
ancient
art, the Islamic art of
West Africa
, the Christian art of
East Africa
, and the traditional
artifacts
of these and other regions. Many
African sculptures
were historically made of wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago, although rare older pottery and metal figures can be found in some areas.
[232]
Some of the earliest decorative objects, such as shell beads and evidence of paint, have been discovered in Africa, dating to the
Middle Stone Age
.
[233]
[234]
[235]
Masks
are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, and are often highly Stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin and depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among "groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the
Niger
and
Congo rivers
" in West Africa.
[236]
Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for ritual ceremonies. Since the late 19th century there has been an increasing amount of
African art in Western collections
, the finest pieces of which are displayed as part of the history of colonization.
African art has had an important influence on European
Modernist
art,
[237]
which was inspired by their interest in abstract depiction. It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed to the very concept of "African art", as seen by European and American artists and art historians.
[238]
West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous
Benin Bronzes
, to decorate palaces and for highly
naturalistic
royal heads from around the
Bini
town of
Benin City, Edo State
, as well as in terracotta or metal, from the 12th-14th centuries.
Akan gold weights
are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400-1900; some apparently represent
proverbs
, contributing a narrative element rare in African sculpture; and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.
[239]
Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The
Mande
-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs shaped like cylinders. In
Central Africa
, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.
Architecture
This section is an excerpt from
Architecture of Africa
.
[
]
The
Great Pyramids of Giza
are regarded as one of the greatest architectural feats of all time and are one of the
Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
Like other aspects of the
culture of Africa
, the
architecture of Africa
is exceptionally diverse. Throughout the
history of Africa
,
Africans
have developed their own local
architectural
traditions. In some cases, broader regional styles can be identified, such as the
Sudano-Sahelian architecture
of
West Africa
. A common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of
fractal
scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.
[240]
African architecture in some areas has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according to available evidence. Western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century and is now an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.
African architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, mud,
mudbrick
,
rammed earth
, and stone. These material preferences vary by region: North Africa for stone and rammed earth, the
Horn of Africa
for stone and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.

and others.
Cinema of Africa
covers both the
history
and present of the
making
or screening of films on the African continent, and also refers to the persons involved in this form of
audiovisual
culture. It dates back to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use. During the
colonial era
, African life was shown only by the work of white, colonial, Western filmmakers, who depicted Africans in a negative fashion, as exotic "others".
[241]
As there are more than 50 countries with audiovisual traditions, there is no one single 'African cinema'. Both historically and culturally, there are major regional differences between
North African
and
sub-Saharan
cinemas, and between the cinemas of different countries.
[241]
The
cinema of Tunisia
and the
cinema of Egypt
are among the oldest in the world. Pioneers
Auguste and Louis Lumière
screened their films in
Alexandria
,
Cairo
,
Tunis
,
Susa, Libya
and
Hammam-Lif
,
Tunisia
in 1896.
[242]
[243]
Albert Samama Chikly
is often cited as the first producer of indigenous African cinema, screening his own short documentaries in the
casino
of Tunis as early as December 1905.
[244]
Alongside his daughter
Haydée Tamzali
, Chikly would go on to produce important early milestones such as 1924's
The Girl from Carthage
. In 1935, the
MISR film
studio in Cairo began producing mostly formulaic comedies and musicals, but also films like Kamal Selim's
The Will
(1939). Egyptian cinema flourished in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, considered its Golden Age.

Given the vastness of the African continent, its music is diverse, with
regions

nations
having many distinct
musical
traditions. African music includes the genres
amapiano
,
Jùjú
,
Fuji
,
Afrobeat
,
Highlife
,
Makossa
,
Kizomba
, and others. African music also uses a large variety of instruments across the continent. The music and dance of the
African diaspora
, formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include
American music
like
Dixieland jazz
,
blues
,
jazz
, and many
Caribbean
genres, such as
calypso
(see
kaiso
) and
soca
.
Latin American music
genres such as
cumbia
,
salsa music
,
son cubano
,
rumba
,
conga
,
bomba
,
samba
and
zouk
were founded on the music of
enslaved Africans
, and have in turn influenced
African popular music
.
[247]
Like the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. The complex rhythmic patterns often involving one rhythm played against another to create a
polyrhythm
. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes.
Sub-Saharan African music traditions
frequently rely on percussion instruments of many varieties, including

Dance
This section is an excerpt from
African dance
.
[
]
African dance
refers to the various dance styles of
sub-Saharan Africa
. These dances are closely connected with the traditional
rhythms
and
music traditions
of the region. Music and dancing is an integral part of many traditional African societies. Songs and dances facilitate teaching and promoting social values, celebrating special events and major life milestones, performing
oral history
and other recitations, and spiritual experiences.
[249]
African dance utilizes the concepts of
polyrhythm
and total body articulation.
[250]
African dances are a collective activity performed in large groups, with significant interaction between dancers and onlookers in the majority of styles.
[251]
Sports
Best results of African men's national football teams at the FIFA World Cup
Fifty-four African countries have
football
teams in the
Confederation of African Football
. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent
FIFA World Cups
. Morocco made history at the
2022 World Cup in Qatar
as the first African nation to reach the semi-finals of the FIFA Men's World Cup. South Africa hosted the
2010 World Cup tournament
, becoming the first African country to do so.
The top clubs in each African football league play the
CAF Champions League
, while lower-ranked clubs compete in
CAF Confederation Cup
.
In recent years, the continent has made major progress in terms of state-of-the-art
basketball
facilities which have been built in cites as diverse as
Cairo
,
Dakar
,
Johannesburg
,
Kigali
,
Luanda
and
Rades
.
[252]
The number of African basketball players who drafted into the
NBA
has experienced major growth in the 2010s.
[253]
Cricket
is popular in some African nations.
South Africa
and
Zimbabwe
have
Test
status, while
Kenya
is the leading non-test team and previously had
One-Day International cricket
(ODI) status (from
10 October 1997
, until
30 January 2014
). The three countries jointly hosted the
2003 Cricket World Cup
.
Namibia
is the other African country to have played in a World Cup.
Morocco
in northern Africa has also hosted the
2002 Morocco Cup
, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament.
Rugby
is popular in several southern African nations.
Namibia
and
Zimbabwe
both have appeared on multiple occasions at the
Rugby World Cup
, while South Africa is the joint-most successful national team (alongside New Zealand) at the Rugby World Cup, having won the tournament on 3 occasions, in 1995, 2007, and 2019.

Architect(s)
Frank Lloyd Wright
Robert and Rae Levin House
, also
Robert Levin House
and
Robert Levin Residence
, is a
single-family home
in
Kalamazoo, Michigan
and designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright
.
In 1949,
[
clarification needed
]
Robert and Rae Levin worked with Frank Lloyd Wright to build a house, the first one to be constructed in Parkwyn Village, a
planned community
of
Usonian
houses. Usonia is a word used by Frank Lloyd Wright and refers to the residents of the
U
nited
S
tates
O
f
N
orth
A
merica.
[2]
Those houses were meant for the common man at that time.
[2]
The finished house was constructed of
textile blocks
(patterned blocks made by pouring concrete into a mold), big windows and skylights, built-in furniture, and a mix of shallow and grand sloping ceilings. Wright designed the house to be connected closely to nature.
[2]
Beginning process
[
edit
]
In the early 1940s, a group of employees from the
Upjohn Company
began to meet and plan for a new cooperative community in Kalamazoo. They were looking for a design that was inexpensive yet practical, and a community where decisions were made equally.
[3]
The group began to search for land and interview architects. After interviewing architects they asked for their opinion as to what architect would be the best for the job, and they all said Frank Lloyd Wright, but that he would never agree to work with them.
The group contacted Wright between 1946 and 1947 requesting his involvement in their community. By phone the group explained their ideas and were invited to
Taliesin
to explain their ideas more thoroughly. Part of the group went to present their ideas. Even though it was a small task during this period of his career, Wright accepted the job.
[3]
After Wright agreed to work with them, they began recruiting other families to become part of their community. Potential families had to attend a Parkwyn Association meeting before they could buy land within the community. The association was not allowed to discriminate against race, religion, or color.
[2]
By November 1948 there were 26 families.
The group then found 72 acres (290,000 m
2
) of land in
Galesburg
, ten miles (16 km) away from Kalamazoo. Some wanted to live there, but others wanted to live closer to town. Soon the group split into two, those who wanted to live closer to the city, and those who wanted to live in Galesburg, often called "
The Acres
" or "Galesburg Country Homes". The families wanting to live closer to town found 47 acres (190,000 m
2
) and called their community "Parkwyn Village". Although the two groups were not living in the same location, they worked together to promote both communities.
[4]
During 1947 both
plats
were designed, and sent to the
Federal Housing Administration
for approval. Wright planned circular lots for Parkwyn Village so there would be shared space between each house, but later changed them to rectangles after having the lots denied by the FHA for financing. Even though technically the area between each house was not shared, the owners planted trees and flowers between the properties to honor the original plans.
[2]
The plan included space for community owned property. That area included an outdoor grill, picnic tables, swings,
teeter-totters
, tennis courts, an ice-skating rink, a
baseball diamond
, swimming pool, and a community center. Some of these amenities were forgotten and never completed.
[3]
Wright also planned for a circular road pattern to build a stronger sense of community, and underground utilities so there would be no curbs, gutters, sewers, or above ground telephone wires.
[3]
Textile blocks
[
edit
]
Frank Lloyd Wright designed textile blocks
Textile blocks are concrete blocks designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and were used to build the Levin House. Some blocks contained patterns and some had cut outs with glass inserted, to allow light to filter through.
The Association was told there was going to be a machine to help with the making of the blocks. A machine was never made available to them like Wright said.
[5]
An engineer, who was part of the Parkwyn Association, built a mold for making the concrete blocks. First, concrete was poured into the mold, and then the mold was removed and the block was set outside to cure overnight. Proper curing strengthens the blocks and makes them more durable. Water is needed to cure the blocks and the closest supply was from the nearby pond, so that was the water used.
[5]
The color added to the blocks was a mix of red and yellow, creating a shade of orange. Rae Levin chose the color for the blocks. Unskilled laborers were hired from a local university to make the blocks. They were mostly college students interested in the project.
[5]
Over 15,000 blocks were built.
[5]
Due to the pond water, a white residue was left on the blocks. The unskilled laborers did not understand that the blocks were not going to be covered by plaster or wallpaper but were going to be seen from the inside.
[5]
The discoloration was an annoyance to the owners.
[5]
The house was assembled without mortar between the bricks, but with a steel rod for the inner foundation. This method of assembling the blocks was also used for the
Imperial Hotel
.
Money
[
edit
]
Wright, after meeting with the two groups, agreed to an average house price of $15,000. The end price turned out to be much higher than Wright had estimated.
[5]
The 47 acres (190,000 m
2
) of land cost $18,000. The roads cost $7,000. The under-ground electricity cost $9,000. The telephone wiring cost $1,600. The water system cost $10,000. Surveying of the land cost $1,500. The surveying of the land after the FHA denied the circular lots cost $600. The tennis courts cost $2,772.
[5]
Finished house
[
edit
]
Exterior of the Levin House
As with many of the Usonian houses, Wright used a large amount of glass, wide roof overhangs, large fireplaces, open interiors, spacious terraces, and outdoor living facilities. He did not like the idea of a house being like a cardboard box, so his designs were far from four walls and a single flat roof.
[2]
A Usonian house was intended to be "a thing loving the ground with the new sense of space, light, and freedom."
Wright used natural light to help dramatize forms and textures. In the Levin house there were many grand windows, as well as smaller cut-outs that light could shine through in the textile bricks.
To help simplify the house, the garage became an open-carport, radiators became radiant heat, and paint was not used in favor of natural wood. Wright also reduced the need for free standing furniture by creating built-in furniture.
[3]
The original finished house consisted of three bedrooms, two baths, a study, a living room, a dining room, a screened in porch, and a small basement utility room. In the original plans the kitchen was labeled as a workspace that included the clothes washer and dryer. Later a family room, two bedrooms, and a basement were added to the house.
[5]
Life in the house
[
edit
]
Interior of the Levin House
James Levin, son of Robert and Rae Levin, remembers people knocking at the door wanting to see his home. About once a month students and others interested in Wright's work would ask for a tour of the Levin House.
[5]
Because Wright designed his homes to be horizontal with the surrounding environment, his roofs were flat, causing them to leak.
[2]
After a snowfall, the Levins would climb onto the roof to shovel snow off it.
[5]
Wright made the Usonian houses feel like a comfortable shelter by lowering the ceilings to “human proportions”.
[2]
In a section of the Levin House, the roof is about five feet from the ground, when outside. The Levin children loved the low roof because in the winter they would jump off of it and into the snow banks.
[5]
The most frequent complaint in the Usonian homes was the kitchen.
[2]
Wright didn't think big kitchens were important.
[2]
The homeowners disliked the small size and lack of view to the outside.
Originally there was no attic or basement. In place of a garage there was a carport. The house had very little storage space, but there was a small shed accessible from the outside that the Levins used to store pickles.

Regionalism in Somogy County
is a political phenomenon that focuses on the normative interests of
Somogy County
and its citizens in Hungarian politics. This can be derived from the former independent
Duchy of Somogy
and the administrative division maintained by the older
County system
(1000-1049) of the
Hungarian Kingdom
and later by the current
county system
in force since 1949.
Association for Somogy
is currently the only regionalist party of Somogy County.
Ideology
[
edit
]
Somogy County economically, culturally, linguistically or religiously does not form a distinct area in
Hungary
since its industry is an organic part of the
Hungarian economy
and its population is Hungarian and Christian in majority. The regionalist intentions are for the creation of an attractive and sustaining force for capital and labor, furthermore for the economic development of the county. However they demand more sovereignty, there is no claim to separatism.
[1]
According to the
Association for Somogy
political party there are some leading objectives of regionalist politics in Somogy which includes the improvement of infrastructure, health, education, public security and the support of those who creates employment opportunities. Helping the young in starting their lives and the elderly in their livelihood, as well as catching up the disadvantaged are also significant goals. One of their main aim is establishing an autonomous
Balaton Region
at
Lake Balaton
.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
The
Duchy of Somogy
as an autonomous area between the
River Drava
and
Lake Balaton
was created in the 10th century. The first known ruler of the principality was
Fajsz
who had his residence in
Somogyvár
. He was followed by
Zerind the Bald
, then by
Koppány
who in the
Battle of Veszprém
was defeated by
Stephen I of Hungary
. Consequently, Somogy became part of the newly formed county system as
Somogy County
.

The scheme for classifying buildings in Scotland is:
Category A
: "buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic; or fine, little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type."
[1]
Category B
: "buildings of regional or more than local importance; or major examples of some particular period, style or building type, which may have been altered."
[1]
Category C
: "buildings of local importance; lesser examples of any period, style, or building type, as originally constructed or moderately altered; and simple traditional buildings which group well with other listed buildings."
[1]
In March 2016 there were 47,288 listed buildings in Scotland. Of these, 8% were Category A, and 50% were Category B, with the remaining 42% being Category C.

United Nations Security Council resolution 973
, adopted unanimously on 13 January 1995, after recalling resolutions
621
(1988),
658
(1990),
690
(1991),
725
(1991),
809
(1993) and
907
(1994), the Council discussed the
Settlement Plan
for the
Western Sahara
and extended the mandate of
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) until 31 May 1995.
[1]
Acknowledging the Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali
's visit to the Western Sahara in November 1994, the Council affirmed that a
referendum
of
self-determination
must be held for the people of the territory. The Secretary-General felt that the MINURSO mission, which was responsible for the organisation of the referendum, required more staff for the purposes of
voter registration
. The Settlement Plan as a whole had also been delayed.
The council stated that the referendum was to go ahead as planned to solve the issue in the Western Sahara.
[2]
The extension of MINURSO as defined by the secretary-general was approved concerning the deployment of
observers
. In this regard, he was requested to report to the council by 31 March 1995 on the logistic, personnel and other resources required and its further plans. The transitional period would begin on 1 June 1995 with a view to holding the referendum in October 1995 and the termination of MINURSO. The possible extension of MINURSO beyond 31 May 1995 was dependent on a report by the Secretary-General.

Bilateral relations
Namibia - United States relations
Namibia
United States
Namibia - United States relations
are
bilateral relations
between
Namibia
and the
United States
.
History
[
edit
]
During the
South African Border War
, the United States mediated in bringing to fruition the
Tripartite Accord
which committed to a withdrawal of Cuban and South African military personnel from
Angola
and South West Africa (present-day Namibia) respectively. The United States recognized Namibia on 21 March 1990 soon after obtaining independence from
South Africa
. The U.S. Liaison Office at Windhoek was elevated to an embassy.
[1]
Relations between both nations are friendly. The United States participated in the diplomatic efforts to bring about Namibia’s 1990 independence from South Africa and has since worked to strengthen political, economic, and people-to-people ties. The bilateral relationship is characterized by a shared commitment to democratic principles, including the rule of law, respect for human rights, independence of the judiciary, and freedom of the press. The United States and Namibia are partners in the effort to combat HIV/AIDS, stem wildlife trafficking and promote conservation, and expand trade and development opportunities.

Frederick Brown "Fritz" Fisher
(born November 28, 1941) is an American former
professional baseball
player. A
left-handed
pitcher
who attended the
University of Michigan
(where he compiled a 21-9 record, including a 9-1 mark in his senior year in 1962), Fisher played five years in
minor league baseball
and was a standout at the Double-A level, but in his only
Major League
appearance, in April 1964 for the
Detroit Tigers
, he was treated roughly and gained only one
out
.  In one-third of an
inning
, Fisher yielded two
hits
, four
earned runs
and two
bases on balls
.
Fisher was listed at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 180 pounds (82 kg). After a successful professional debut with the Double-A
Knoxville Smokies
and impressing
manager
Chuck Dressen
[1]
during workouts in 1963, Fisher was added to the Tigers' 40-man
spring training
roster for 1964.
[1]
He was kept on the team's early-season 28-man squad. During Detroit's fourth game of the
American League
campaign, on April 19 at
Tiger Stadium
, Fisher made his debut in
relief
the ninth
inning
with the Tigers trailing the
Minnesota Twins
, 8-3. The first batter he faced was a future
Hall of Famer
,
Harmon Killebrew
, and Fisher struck him out.
[2]
But that was the only out he recorded; he walked the next two batters and gave up run-scoring hits to
Jerry Zimmerman
and
Camilo Pascual
before being relieved by
Ed Rakow
, who allowed the inherited runners to score.
[2]
Fisher spent the rest of 1964 with Knoxville and the Triple-A
Syracuse Chiefs
, and he retired after the 1967 season, never returning to the Majors. His minor league
record
of 44 wins and 25 defeats and a 3.05
earned run average
in 103 games included a 33-15 (2.66) mark at the Double-A level.

"
Satellite
" is a song recorded by Canadian
rock
group
Nickelback
for their eighth studio album,
No Fixed Address
(2014). A
pop rock
"power
ballad
" about an all-encompassing love, the song was written by group members
Chad Kroeger
and
Ryan Peake
with
Josh Ramsay
and
David Hodges
. Nickelback co-produced the track with Chris Baseford. "Satellite" was released March 23, 2015 as the album's sixth single and serves as the second
pop
single in continental Europe. The song was later serviced to
hot adult contemporary
radio stations in the United States on May 11, 2015 as the album's third pop single in North America.
[1]
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by
Nigel Dick
, serves as the second half of a two-part story started in the video for "
Get 'Em Up
". Music critics were divided on their opinion of "Satellite", with some praising the ballad form and others labelling the song as "cliché." The song only charted in Canada, where it peaked outside the top 40 on the national
adult contemporary
chart.
Release and promotion
[
edit
]
In January 2015,
Universal Music Germany
announced "Satellite" as the album's second European single, with the release date yet to be determined.
[2]
Nickelback opted for three region-specific releases for the album's second pop single after "
What Are You Waiting For?
": "Miss You" was released in the United Kingdom and "
She Keeps Me Up
" was released in North America, both in February 2015,
[3]
[4]
and "Satellite" was released to continental Europe.
[2]
This release materialized on March 23, 2015.
[5]
The group uploaded an official lyric video for the song on March 18, 2015.
[6]
Republic Records
announced that "Satellite" would serve as the album's third pop single in the United States and serviced the song to the
hot adult contemporary
radio format on May 11, 2015.
[1]
"Satellite" was also released as the third radio single in the United Kingdom, being added to the
BBC Radio 2
B List for the week ending May 23, 2015.
[7]
Critical reception
[
edit
]
Chase Hunt of
AXS TV
wrote that "Satellite" was an indicator of where "the creative juices seem to start running out" on the album, calling the song a "cliché tune" about love.

complimented "Satellite" and "Miss You" as examples of Nickelback's sweet spot, writing that "the power ballad "Satellite" ... could easily be mistaken for adult contemporary pop from Y2K."
[9]
Jeremy Thomas of 411 Mania criticized the song's formulaic composition, writing that "Satellite" "makes grand but meaningless statements... and sounds audibly like just about every rock ballad they've done."

Rounds
[
edit
]
Round One (Open Auditions):
Open auditions were held in Beijing. Rappers would rap without music and if the producers liked it, they would hand the rapper a chain that indicates that they move on to the next round.
Round Two (60 Second Rap):
Contestants that passed would be given 60 seconds each to present their prepared rap to the producers. They only need one producer to pass for them to move on; however, if all the producers fail them, they would be eliminated.
Round Three (Team Cypher):
Contestants draw a name from a hat to pick their temporary team. Each team takes a turn to freestyle to a beat on a topic that their producer chose. If they don’t get the microphone in the time permitted or their rap is deemed not good enough, they are chosen for elimination.
Round Four (1 vs 1 Battle):
Based on their assessment in the previous round, the contestants chose an opponent to battle against. They choose a beat and create a song together that is performed. When they battle, producers vote on who was better and the loser is eliminated. The 20 contestants who were eliminated in the 1 vs 1 battles return and each producer team chooses one rapper to return.
Round Five (Team Selection):
Each producer team performs in front of the contestants and an audience who votes for their favorite. From the votes, the judges earn chances to select rappers to form teams. The producers sit on one side of the doors and contestants enter from the opposite room. If both the producer and contestant stand at the door, the contestant makes it into that producer's team. If not, they will still have a chance at being chosen later on. Each team can have up to 5 members.
Round Six (Team Performance Part I):
Each team has a short amount of time after selection to create a team song to a chosen beat. They perform in front of an audience that votes for the member that they think did the worst. That member is then eliminated.
Round Seven (Team Performance Part II):
Once again, each team creates a team song; however, they perform for just the producers this time around. The producer of each team chooses a member to eliminate from their team.
Round Eight (Demon Challenge and Team Performance):
A mainstream artist is invited on the show and assesses a member from each team. Both separately perform a prepared song. Representatives from media companies vote on their performances. If the contestant wins, they immediately advance to the top 6. The producers and their teams create a song together and perform it for the audience. The team with the most votes can save a member while the second team is up for elimination. The last team is forced to immediately eliminate one member.
Round Nine (Semi-finals Part I):
The top 6 are drawn against one another to each perform a song. Renowned music producers then vote on which contestant was better in each battle. The 3 losing contestants battle against each other and 2 are eliminated.
Round Ten (Semi-finals Part II):
The 4 contestants team up with a guest singer for a performance. The 2 rappers with the lowest votes compete against each other and one is eliminated.
Round Eleven (Finals):
The remaining 3 rappers as well as one resurrected rapper perform to a live audience. Votes decides who moves on until there are only 2 rappers left. The final 2 contestants each perform a song and the winner is decided by a combination of votes from invited peers and the producers.

[11]
Controversies
[
edit
]
The show has been accused of plagiarizing South Korean rap competition show
Show Me the Money
. There were rumors that
iQiyi
already bought the rights for the show from
CJ E&M
; however,
Mnet
stated "
Show Me the Money
is not the content which
CJ E&M
sold the rights."
[12]
[13]
In addition, since the release of "China Has Hip Hop", many rappers have released
diss
tracks about the show.
[14]
NetEase Music
has included a considerable number of diss songs on
The Rap of China
.
[15]
Some rappers stated in their diss tracks that they and other rappers spent a lot of money and went to Beijing to compete in the show, but only appeared on screen for a few second, or not all.  Producers of the show were accused of overlooking talented artists, and others critiqued the mentors invited by the show for being less talented than the participants. Other controversies included the inclusion of hanmai participants, as there is debate as to whether hanmai, a style of Chinese party rap, is considered hiphop. Many people emphatically blamed
Kris Wu
and Che Che, and affirmed their respect for some of the well-known rappers.  Some netizens commented: "There is hip-hop in China, but not in iQiyi".
[16]
After the government cracked down on some of the participants in the first season, the second season and further were accused of being overly sanitized: contestants had to adhere strictly to Chinese nationalism and omit most references to sex, drugs, or cops.

The following is a comprehensive discography of
Sparks
, an American
rock
and
pop music
band formed in
Los Angeles
in 1970 by brothers
Ron
(keyboards) and
Russell Mael
(vocals), initially under the name
Halfnelson
. Best known for their quirky approach to songwriting,
[1]
Sparks' music is often accompanied by cutting and acerbic lyrics,
[2]
and an idiosyncratic stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's wide-eyed hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's sedentary scowling.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation
Emblem of India
Agency overview
Formed
27 May 2004
Dissolved
6 July 2017
Jurisdiction
Government of India
Headquarters
New Delhi
Website
The
Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation
was a ministry of the
Government of India
responsible for urban
poverty
,
housing
, and
employment
programs. It involved in national policy decisions and coordinates with Indian central
ministries
, state governments, and central sponsor programs.
On 6 July 2017, the ministry was re-united with the Ministry of Urban Development to form the
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The ministry was first created in 1999 as the "Ministry of Urban Affairs and Poverty Alleviation" and existed alongside the
Ministry of Urban Development
. On 22 November 1999, the ministry was renamed as the "Ministry of Urban Employment and Poverty Alleviation" and was concerned for generating employment in urban areas. On 27 May 2000, the ministry was merged along with the Ministry of Urban Development and renamed as the "Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation".
Following the formation of the
First Manmohan Singh ministry
on 22 May 2004, the Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation was re-bifurcated into the "Ministry of Urban Development" and the "Ministry of Urban Employment and Poverty Alleviation". The Ministry of Urban Employment and Poverty Alleviation was renamed as the "Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation" on 1 June 2006. The ministry was re-merged with the Ministry of Urban Development on 6 July 2017 to form the "
Ministry of Urban Affairs
.
Overview.
[
edit
]
The
Indian Constitution
has allocated responsibility for
housing
and
urban development
to the state; and the 74th amendment to the Constitution delegates some responsibility to the local governments. The ministry was responsible for the
national capital territory
of
Delhi
and
union territories
. It also provided finances through federal institutions and allocates resources to the state governments. The ministry supported the country's external housing and urban development assistance programs.
[2]
Divisions
[
edit
]
The ministry had administrative control over the
National Buildings Organisation
(NBO) attached office and the Hindustan Prefab Limited (HPL) and
Housing and Urban Development Corporation
(HUDCO)
public sector undertakings
. It was also responsible for the following statutory and autonomous bodies:
Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC)
Central Government Employees Welfare Housing Organisation
(CGEWHO)
National Cooperative Housing Federation of India (NCHFI)
Principal Account Office (PAO)
Sectors for improvement
[
edit
]
For poverty alleviation programs to be successful, the following sectors should realise improvements: Income generation, health, shelter, education, environment and infrastructure. Environmental Improvement for Urban Slum, Urban Basic Service programs, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Shelter and Infrastructural facilities, and Low Cost Sanitation Night Shelter are examples of schemes to meet these objectives.
[3]
The Ministry had constituted a Committee on Streamlining Approval Procedures for Real Estate Projects (SAPREP)
[4]
under the Chairmanship of
Dhanendra Kumar
, former Chairman of Competition Commission of India. Amongst other things, the concept of single window clearance as advocated by this committee report draw parallels with government's effort towards improving ease of doing business in the country.
[5]
National programs and legislation
[
edit
]
The
Government of India
has launched various programs since its
independence
, such as some of the
five-year plans
, to alleviate poverty and address the widening income gap, both, amongst the upper and lower classes of society, and amongst the rural and urban parts of the country.
[6]
For instance, the "
Eighth Plan
policy guidelines envisages integrated approach to alleviation of urban poverty and servicing the urban poor with basic facilities so that their quality of life improves."
[7]
As trends in the
Gini coefficient
reflect,
[6]
the income gaps were not as pronounced until the early 1980s, but the situation has been continually getting worse since. Misplaced priorities of the Indian Government and bad planning of subsidy programs is largely responsible for this.

Hosting the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in 2010 that cost the exchequer an approximate
₹
110 billion
(US$1.4 billion), excluding the price of non-sports related infrastructure, is a case in point.
[8]
While newly launched programs like
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
(MNREGA),
National Rural Health Mission
(NRHM),
Food Security Act
, Mid-day Meals and
Bharat Nirman Yojana
have demonstrated success in the initial stages, their performance over the long-run still remains to be seen.  The shortsightedness of the Indian government often leads it to launch populist programs that may not necessarily work well. Low-hanging fruit like increasing worker's
minimum wage
can go a long way in achieving the goal of poverty alleviation, but are yet to be taken up in spite of reminders from leading
economists
.

The
Ford Fiesta Mk1
is the first generation of the
Ford Fiesta
supermini
. Originally introduced in 1976, it was
Ford Europe
's first multi-national
front-wheel-drive
automobile
, and was available in both 3-door
hatchback
and
panel van
derivatives. In 1983, the Fiesta was updated, and the
Fiesta Mk2
was introduced.
History
[
edit
]
The Fiesta was originally developed under the project name "Bobcat" (not to be confused with the subsequent
rebadged
Mercury
variant of the
Ford Pinto
) and approved for development by
Henry Ford II
in September 1972.
[1]
Development targets indicated a production cost US$100 less than the current
Escort
.
[2]
The car was to have a wheelbase longer than that of the
Fiat 127
(although shorter than some other rivals, like the
Peugeot 104
,
Renault 5
and
Volkswagen Polo
),
[3]
but with an overall length shorter than that of the Escort. The final proposal was developed by
Tom Tjaarda
at
Ghia
.
[3]
The project was approved for production in December 1973, with Ford's engineering centres in Cologne and
Dunton (Essex)
collaborating.
[3]
Ford estimated that 500,000 Fiestas a year would be produced, and built an all-new
factory
in
Almussafes
,
Valencia
,
Spain
; a trans-axle factory near
Bordeaux, France
; factory extensions for the assembly plants in Dagenham, UK. Final assembly also took place in Valencia.
[4]
Ford's plants in
Dagenham
, England, and
Saarlouis
and
Cologne
(from 1979) in Germany, also manufactured Fiestas.
The motoring press had begun speculating about the existence of the Bobcat project since 1973, but it was not until December 1975 that Ford officially announced it as the Fiesta.
[3]
A Fiesta was on display at the
24 Hours of Le Mans
in
June 1976
, and a few rallys.
The name
Fiesta
belonged to
General Motors
when the car was designed, as they had used the name for the
Oldsmobile Fiesta
in the 1950s; however, it was freely given for Ford to use on their new supermini.
[3]
Ford's marketing team had preferred the name
Bravo
, but Henry Ford II vetoed it in favour of the Fiesta name.
[3]
Mechanically, the Fiesta adopted the now industry-standard mechanical layout pioneered by Fiat with a transverse mounted engine coupled to an end-on four-speed
manual transmission
of the
Ford BC-Series
with unequal length driveshafts. The power unit would be a new "short block" version of the venerable
Ford Kent
OHV
engine, dubbed "Valencia" after the new factory's location. To cut costs and speed up the research and development, the new powertrain package destined for the Fiesta was tested in
Fiat 127
development "mules".
[3]
Unlike several rivals, which used
torsion bars
in their suspension, the Fiesta used
coil springs
.
[3]
The front suspension was of Ford's typical "track control arm" arrangement, where
MacPherson struts
were combined with lower control arms and longitudinal compression links.
[3]
The standard rear suspension used a
beam axle
, trailing links and a
Panhard rod
, whilst an
anti-roll bar
was included in the sports package.
[3]
All Mk1 Fiestas featured 12-inch wheels as standard, with
disc brakes
at the front and
drum brakes
at the rear.
[3]
Ford paid particular attention ease of service, and published the times required to replace various common parts.
[5]
Model history
[
edit
]
Although not the first Ford vehicle to feature
front-wheel drive
(the 1960s
Taunus 12M
produced by
Ford of Germany
laid claim to that title), the Fiesta is widely credited as being Ford's first globally successful front-wheel-drive model, and was the first front-wheel drive Ford car to feature a transverse engine layout.  Pilot production began at Cologne in April 1976, with production starting in Valencia and Dagenham in October of that year. The Fiesta was officially launched in the UK on February 2, 1977, where it was available from £1,856 for the basic 950 cc-engined model.
[6]
It was only the second hatchback supermini to have been built in the UK at this stage, being launched a year after the
Vauxhall Chevette
, but nearly a year before the launch of the
Chrysler Sunbeam
and four years before the
Austin Metro
. The millionth Fiesta was produced in 1979.
[1]
Ford Fiesta XR2
The car was initially available in Europe with the Valencia 957 cc (58.4 cu in)
I4
(high compression and low compression options), and 1,117 cc (68.2 cu in) engines and in Base, Popular, L, GL (1978 onward), Ghia and S trim, as well as a
van
.  The U.S. Mark I Fiesta was built in
Saarlouis
and Cologne, Germany but to slightly different specifications; U.S. models were Base, Decor, Sport, and Ghia, the Ghia having the highest level of trim.
[7]
These trim levels changed very little in the Fiesta's three-year run in the US, from 1977 to 1980. All U.S. models featured the more powerful 1,596 cc (97.4 cu in) engine, which was the older "Crossflow" version of the Kent engine.  Among the other changes required for the US market, the Fiesta was fitted with a catalytic converter and air pump to satisfy strict Californian emission regulations), energy-absorbing bumpers, side-marker lamps, round sealed-beam headlamps, improved crash dynamics and fuel system integrity as well as optional air conditioning (a/c was not available in Europe). In the U.S. market, the
Ford Escort
replaced both the Fiesta and the compact
Pinto
in 1981.
At the beginning of the British government's
Motability
scheme for disabled motorists in 1978, the Fiesta was one of the key cars to be available on the scheme.
[8]
A sporting derivative (1.3 L Supersport) was offered in Europe for the 1980 model year, using the 1.3 L (79 cu in) Kent Crossflow engine,  effectively to test the market for the similar XR2 introduced a year later, which featured a 1.6 L version of the same engine. Black plastic trim was added to the exterior and interior. The small square headlights were replaced with larger circular ones resulting in the front indicators being moved into the bumper to accommodate the change. With a quoted performance of 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) in 9.3 seconds and 105 mph (169 km/h) top speed, the XR2
hot hatch
became a cult car beloved of
boy racers
throughout the 1980s.
For the 1979 auto show season, Ford in conjunction with its Ghia Operations in Turin, Italy,  produced the Ford Fiesta Tuareg off-road car.  It was touted in press materials as "a concept vehicle designed and equipped for practical, off-road recreational use."
[9]
Minor revisions appeared across the range in late 1981, with larger bumpers to meet crash worthiness regulations and other small improvements in a bid to maintain showroom appeal ahead of the forthcoming second generation.
It was well-received on most European markets, particularly the United Kingdom, where it was the ninth best selling car in its first year, and by 1981 it was the third best seller. However, in 1982 it was outsold by BL's new
Austin Metro
, and with a host of new superminis being launched across Europe between September 1982 and June 1983, Ford was keen to update the Fiesta in order to keep it competitive with its rivals.

Convertible conversions
[
edit
]
Crayford
[
edit
]
In 1981,
coachbuilders
Crayford
developed a convertible version of the Fiesta, which was dubbed the Fiesta Fly.
[23]
Designed by David McMullan, the Fiesta Fly had a permanently welded-shut boot, with a plastic sill fitted to prevent the car from needing to be repainted.
[23]
The production history of the Fiesta Fly is not clear; but the common claim that only 20 or so cars were built is probably untrue; it is believed that this figure refers to the number built by Crayford, rather than the number built in total.
[24]
What is known is that Dorset-based firm F. English Coachwork Division bought the rights to produce the Fiesta Fly sometime in 1982, and Autocar reported in September 1983 that about 100 Fiesta Fly conversions had been produced.
[25]
It is believed that F English built around 200 Fiesta Flys, with 83 known to survive.
[24]
Crayford also reportedly built two Fiesta Flys based on the Mk2 Fiesta.
[23]
It was also possible to purchase any production Fiesta model in Fiesta Fly form,
[26]
not just the 1300 and XR2 models as often reported.

The
Old town of Visoki
(
Serbo-Croatian
:
Stari grad Visoki
,
Стари град Високи
,
pronounced
[ʋǐsoki:]
) was a medieval royal
castle town
built during the 14th century on the top of the hill overlooking town of
Visoko
,
Bosnia and Herzegovina
. The first mention of the town was on 1 September 1355, in the charter "
in castro nosto Visoka vocatum
" written by
Tvrtko I of Bosnia
while he was a young
ban
.
[1]
The town was presumably abandoned before 1503, as it is not mentioned in the Turkish-Hungarian treaty from the mentioned year.
[1]
In 1626, Đorđić mentioned Visoki among abandoned towns.

Location and size
[

Overhead illustration of the fortress
The Old Town of Visoki is at the top of
Visočica hill
, 213 metres (699 ft) high. Its position provides an excellent view at the plains below. The entry to the castle is on the southwest side, with two lookout towers. Passing through the entry you enter a part that is called
Podvisoki
, which was quite small, measuring 60 by 25 metres (197 by 82 ft) and has signs and remains of early medieval houses. The thickness of the castle town walls is about 2 metres (7 ft). Its position provides an excellent view at the plains below bordered by the mountains
Romanija
,
Jahorina
,
Treskavica
and
Bjelašnica
in the east and southeast,
Bitovnja
in the south, the mountain Zec and
Vranica
in the Southeast,
Vlašić
in the west, and Tajan and
Zvijezda
in the north.
Historic importance
[
edit
]
The primary function of the old town of Visoki was defense, but it was also a place where a lot of medieval
Bosnian rulers
issued various documents and
charters
. The first mention of the town itself was in a charter written by the young Tvrtko I named
in castro nosto Visoka vocatum
on 1 September 1355. The final document of importance signed there was by Tvrtko Borovinić in 1436, showing that it was also of high importance to Bosnian nobility.

The Incline
is an
online newspaper
focused on the
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
region. Launched in 2016, the news outlet curates syndicated content
[2]
and produces original stories aimed towards millennials.
[3]
Instead of ads, The Incline's revenue comes from events. The best known of which is their "Who's next" event series.
[4]
In March 2019, The Incline was acquired by WhereBy.Us.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
Spirited Media founded Philadelphia's web-only local news site
Billy Penn
in 2014. Billy Penn functions as a mixture of links to news articles produced by other outlets with its own original reporting mixed in.
[5]
Rather than direct ad sales, Billy Penn found success with an event-based business model. Spirited Media looked for new cities to deploy it in.
[6]
In 2016, Pittsburgh was identified as the second city after major investments came from
Gannett
.
[7]
The Incline deviated from Billy Penn, by selling ads upon its introduction in order to gain exposure and awareness.
[2]
The Incline was launched in September 2016. The news outlet was named after the
Duquesne Incline
.
[8]
Because of the presence of Silicon Valley companies working with
Carnegie Mellon University
and the absence of a tech business website in Pittsburgh, the Incline focused more on technology news compared to its Philadelphia counterpart.
[9]
The Incline was also experimented on curation of news based on the moods of their readers.
[2]
Awards and recognition
[
edit
]
The Incline won the award for the “Biggest blockbuster story” at the Hearken's 2018 Champions of Curiosity Awards.
[10]
The Incline obtained recognition in multiple categories from the Press Club of Western Pennsylvania at the 54th Golden Quill Awards.
[11]
The Incline won an award from the 30th Anniversary Vann Media Awards for their coverage of business news.

Occupation
actor
Terry Scully
(13 May 1932 - 17 April 2001) was a British theatre and television actor.
[1]
[2]
After making his name in the theatre, from the 1960s onwards he became more known for TV work. In 1960 he starred in the BBC's production of
An Age of Kings
, playing
King Henry VI
in several episodes.
[3]
Other notable roles for Scully were as
Horatio Nelson
in the 1968 television series,
Triton
, and as Bicket in the BBC's 1967 blockbuster adaptation of
The Forsyte Saga
.
[4]
He also appeared in
Dixon of Dock Green
,
Z-Cars
,
Softly, Softly
,
Callan
,
Public Eye
,
The Venturers
, and
Angels
.
[4]
[5]
Like many actors of his generation, he is now probably best remembered for his roles in Cult TV series, due to their enduring appeal - even though they were no more notable, at the time, than his many other TV roles.  He appeared in the
Doctor Who
serial
The Seeds of Death
, the
Blake's 7
episode "Dawn of the Gods" and starred as Vic Thatcher in four episodes of the 1970s series
Survivors
.
[6]
[7]
[8]
During his time on that series, Scully suffered a nervous breakdown. As a result, his role was filled by actor
Hugh Walters
in subsequent episodes.
[9]
In 2001, Scully died of a stroke, aged 68.

Edward Stephen Rapuano Jr.
(born September 30, 1957) is an
umpire
supervisor in
Major League Baseball
who previously worked as an on-field umpire in the
National League
from 1990 to 1999 and throughout both major leagues from 2000 to 2012.
[1]
Umpiring career
[
edit
]
Rapuano officiated in the
World Series
in
2001
and
2003
, as well as the
All-Star
game in
1995
and
2008
. He also worked in five
League Championship Series
(
1999
,
2000
,
2002
,
2004
,
2005
) and seven
Division Series
(

,
1998
,
2001
,
2003
,
2006
,
2008
,
2010
), and the NL's one-game wild card playoff in
1999
.
[2]
He was also an umpire in the
2009 World Baseball Classic
. Rapuano wore number 19 from 2000 to his retirement in 2012 (Rapuano wore number 23 during his NL tenure, but AL umpire
Rick Reed
had more seniority and claimed the number).
Controversies
[
edit
]
In 2002, Rapuano made contact with
New York Mets
manager
Bobby Valentine
during an exchange in a game with the
Florida Marlins
.
[3]
Valentine was subsequently ejected from the game and fined, although no disciplinary action was taken against Rapuano for allegedly making contact with Valentine. Rapuano acknowledged the contact, but claimed it was accidental.
[4]
In August 2009, plate umpire Rapuano ejected
Philadelphia Phillies
center fielder
Shane Victorino
for arguing balls and strikes from his position in the outfield. After calling a
Rodrigo López
pitch a ball, Rapuano claimed he then warned Victorino for gesturing with his arms. According to Rapuano, Victorino repeated the gesture, leading to the ejection. While Victorino did not admit to gesturing twice, he did say, "I've got to hold myself accountable. It's not something that you should be doing, but I've done it 1,000 times this year. It's not the first time -- and I'm not trying to show anybody up. Just things got built up from the half-inning before that, and it's just one of those things I let my emotions get the best of me."
[5]
Notable games

]
Rapuano was the home plate umpire for
Kent Mercker
's
no-hitter
on April 8, 1994.

1972 Palestinian militant attack in Thailand
Israeli Bangkok embassy hostage crisis
The attack site
Location
Bangkok
, Thailand
Date
28 December 1972
(
1972-12-28
)
Target
Israeli
embassy
Attack type
Hostage taking
Perpetrators
Black September
The
Israeli Bangkok embassy hostage crisis
occurred on 28 December 1972. It was a raid by a squad of four
Palestinian militants
, belonging to the
Black September
organization, on the
Israeli
embassy
building in
Bangkok
in which the militants held six Israeli embassy staff hostage. After 19 hours of
negotiations
, the hijackers agreed to abandon the embassy in exchange for being flown to
Egypt
. The raid was one of a
number of attacks that have been conducted against Israeli embassies and diplomats
.
Attack
The attack began when two Black September operatives infiltrated a party being held at the embassy. Once these two were inside, two others climbed over the wall with
automatic weapons
and together the four took over the embassy. They allowed all the
Thais
to leave but kept six
Israelis
hostage, including
Shimon Avimor
, Israeli Ambassador to Cambodia who was visiting.
[1]
Rehavam Amir
, the Israeli
ambassador
, and his wife Avital were attending the investiture ceremony of
Vajiralongkorn
as
Crown Prince of Thailand
at the
Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall
, thus they were not among the hostages and could therefore participate in the
negotiations
with the militants. Ambassador Amir and Prime Minister
Thanom Kittikachorn
was informed about the siege during a break in the middle of the ceremony.
[2]
The militants moved their hostages to the second floor of the three storey building and made their demands.
[

]
The militants demanded that 36 prisoners be released from
Israeli prisons
, including
Kōzō Okamoto
and the survivors of the
Sabena Flight 571 incident
.
[
citation needed
]
They threatened to blow up the embassy if these demands were not met by 08:00 on 29 December.
[

]
Two Thai government members,
Dawee Chullasapya
and
Chatichai Choonhavan
, who was then deputy foreign minister and became prime minister in 1988, along with the Egyptian ambassador to Thailand, Mustapha el Assawy, negotiated the release of the hostages and instead offered themselves and a number of other Thai officials as surety for the terrorists' safe conduct to Cairo.
[3]
After 19 hours of negotiation, an agreement, subsequently dubbed the "Bangkok solution", was worked out and no-one was injured.
[4]
Feeling that the Thai nation's celebration of the investiture of the
heir to the throne
should not be marred by a dispute that did not concern them, the
Thai government
guaranteed the
terrorists
safe travel to
Cairo
[5]
while leaving the hostages in the care of the Thais.
The Black September leadership was reportedly upset with the behavior of its operatives in settling the incident.
[1]
[6]
[7]
Then-Israeli prime minister

Carthage Administration Inscription
Type

Period/culture
4th to 2nd century BCE
Discovered

Present location

Culture
Carthaginian
The
Carthage Administration Inscription
is an inscription in the
Punic language
, using the
Phoenician alphabet
, discovered on the archaeological site of Carthage in the 1960s and preserved in the
National Museum of Carthage
. It is known as KAI 303.
Found among elements of the Roman period, this inscription is key for the knowledge of the institutions and town planning of Carthage during the Punic period; it refers to magistrates and a sector of the population, corporations and craftsmen.
Its dating varies according to scholars, ranging from the fourth to the second century BC. The text describes works carried out in the city but their exact nature is not established with certainty because of the difficulty of reading the Phoenician language and the gaps in the document.
Discovery
[
edit
]
The inscription was discovered in 1964 during excavations led by
Ammar Mahjoubi
, about 100 m (330 ft) west of the TGM station in Carthage, and 300 m (980 ft) from the potters' quarter located in the current archaeological park of the Antonine Baths. It was mixed upon its discovery with rubble from a late
Roman construction
, "in a layer of embankments covering a 4th-century AD mosaic pavement", and has therefore not been found in situ.

Dupont-Sommer distinguishes four parts in the inscription: the first concerns the evocation of the works that took place in the Punic city. The second is the enumeration of the conductors of these municipal works. In the third sentence are cited various trades involved in the work undertaken. Finally, the listing ends with a threat against anyone who would harm the listing.

[6]
[7]
Hale served in the
United States Air Force
2009-2013 before joining the National Security Agency and leaking classified documents to
The Intercept
. In 2021, he
pled guilty
to retaining and transmitting national defense information and was sentenced to 45 months in prison. As of October 2021, he was incarcerated at
United States Penitentiary, Marion
, Illinois, with a scheduled release date of July 5, 2024.
[8]
Government service
[
edit
]
Hale served in the
United States Air Force
from July 2009 to July 2013. He was an
enlisted
airman. In 2013, he was assigned to the NSA and the
Joint Special Operations Command
at
Bagram Airfield
, the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan, where he helped identify targets for assassination.
[9]
In February 2014, after leaving the Air Force and becoming a contractor at the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
, Hale leaked 17 classified documents to
The Intercept
.
[10]
[11]
The documents contained details about
U.S. kill lists
and
civilian casualties
of
drone strikes
,
[12]
and in some cases revealed actions that, if proven, would amount to
war crimes
.
[13]
Over one five-month period covered by the documents, nearly 90 percent of the people killed in U.S. drone strikes were not the intended targets. In an article published by
Truthout
,
Marjorie Cohn
wrote that "civilian bystanders were nonetheless classified as 'enemies killed in action' unless proven otherwise."
[14]
[15]
The documents formed the basis of a series of articles, the "
Drone Papers
", published by
The
Intercept
in October 2015.

, in what he described as retribution for his political activism. In 2016, he appeared in the documentary film
National Bird
, where he described his crisis of conscience and the FBI raid.
[17]
In 2019, Hale was charged with disclosing intelligence information and theft of government property. He was arraigned in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia
. In March 2021, he pleaded guilty to retaining and transmitting national defense information.
[11]
On July 27, 2021, citing the need to deter others from disclosing government secrets, U.S. District Judge
Liam O'Grady
sentenced Hale to 45 months in prison for violating the
Espionage Act of 1917
. "You are not being prosecuted for speaking out about the drone program killing innocent people", O'Grady told Hale. "You could have been a whistleblower ... without taking any of these documents."
[18]
In court, Hale said he accepted punishment for taking the documents, and for taking innocent lives during his participation in the drone program. Noting that he is a descendant of
Nathan Hale
, executed for spying on the British for the
Continental Army
during the
American Revolutionary War
, Hale paraphrased his ancestor's reported last words, saying, "I have but this one life to give in service of my country."
[18]
Incarceration
[
edit
]
Following sentencing, Hale was transferred from
Alexandria City Jail
to temporary confinement at
Northern Neck Regional Jail
in Virginia to await further disposition.
[19]
In early October 2021, Hale was transferred to a
communications management unit
in the
United States Penitentiary, Marion
, Illinois.
[20]
[21]
In August 2021 he received the
Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence
, eponymously named for a
Vietnam War
-era whistleblower, for "performing a vital public service at great personal cost—imprisonment for truth-telling".
[22]
[23]
Later that month,
U.S. Representative
Ilhan Omar
(D-MN) wrote to
President Biden
requesting a
full pardon
or
commutation of sentence
for Hale.

A phylogenetic representation of Nostratic proposed by

in 2008.
Nostratic
is a hypothetical language
macrofamily
including many of the
language families
of northern Eurasia. Though a historically important proposal, in a contemporary context it is typically considered a
fringe theory
. Although the exact composition varies based on proponent, it typically comprises
Kartvelian
,
Indo-European
and
Uralic
languages; some languages from the similarly controversial
Altaic
family; the
Afroasiatic languages
; as well as the
Dravidian languages
(sometimes also
Elamo-Dravidian
).
The Nostratic hypothesis originates with
Holger Pedersen
in the early 20th century. The name "Nostratic" is due to Pedersen (1903), derived from the Latin
nostrates
"fellow countrymen". The hypothesis was significantly expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, notably
Vladislav Illich-Svitych
and
Aharon Dolgopolsky
.
The hypothesis has fallen out of favour since the latter half of the 20th century and has limited degrees of acceptance, predominantly among a minority of Russian linguists. Linguists worldwide mostly reject Nostratic and many other macrofamily hypotheses with the exception of
Dené-Yeniseian languages
, which has been met with some degree of acceptance.
[2]
In
Russia
, it is endorsed by a minority of linguists, such as
Vladimir Dybo
, but is not a generally accepted hypothesis.

History of research
[
edit

Origin of the Nostratic hypothesis
[
edit
]
The last quarter of the 19th century saw various linguists putting forward proposals linking the
Indo-European languages
to other language families, such as
Finno-Ugric
and
Altaic
.
[7]
These proposals were taken much further in 1903 when
Holger Pedersen
proposed "Nostratic", a common ancestor for the
Indo-European
,
Finno-Ugric
,
Samoyed
,
Turkish
,
Mongolian
,
Manchu
,
Yukaghir
,
Eskimo
,
Semitic
, and
Hamitic
languages, with the door left open to the eventual inclusion of others.
The name
Nostratic
derives from the
Latin
word
nostrās
, meaning 'our fellow-countryman' (plural:
nostrates
) and has been defined, since Pedersen, as consisting of those language families that are related to Indo-European.
[8]
Merritt Ruhlen
notes that this definition is not properly taxonomic but amorphous, since there are broader and narrower degrees of relatedness, and moreover, some linguists who broadly accept the concept (such as Greenberg and Ruhlen himself) have criticised the name as reflecting the
ethnocentrism
frequent among Europeans at the time.
[9]
Martin Bernal
has described the term as distasteful because it implies that speakers of other language families are excluded from academic discussion.
[10]
However, some people like Pedersen's older contemporary
Henry Sweet
attributed some of the resistance by Indo-European specialists to hypotheses of wider genetic relationships as "prejudice against dethroning [Indo-European] from its proud isolation and affiliating it to the languages of yellow races".
[11]
Proposed alternative names such as
Mitian
, formed from the characteristic Nostratic first- and second-person pronouns
mi
'I' and
ti
'you' (more accurately '
thee
'),
[12]
have not attained the same currency.
An early supporter was the French linguist
Albert Cuny
—better known for his role in the development of the
laryngeal theory
[13]
—who published his
Recherches sur le vocalisme, le consonantisme et la formation des racines en « nostratique », ancêtre de l'indo-européen et du chamito-sémitique
('Researches on the Vocalism, Consonantism, and Formation of Roots in "Nostratic", Ancestor of Indo-European and Hamito-Semitic') in 1943. Although Cuny enjoyed a high reputation as a linguist, the work was coldly received.
Moscow School of Comparative Linguistics
[
edit

Main article:
Moscow School of Comparative Linguistics
While Pedersen's Nostratic hypothesis did not make much headway in the West, it became quite popular in what was then the
Soviet Union
. Working independently at first,
Vladislav Illich-Svitych
and
Aharon Dolgopolsky
elaborated the first version of the contemporary form of the hypothesis during the 1960s. They expanded it to include additional language families. Illich-Svitych also prepared the first dictionary of the hypothetical language. Dolgopolsky's most recent
Nostratic Dictionary
was published in 2008, and is considered the most up-to-date attempt at a Nostratic lexicon.
[14]
A principal source for the items in Illich-Svitych's dictionary was the earlier work of
Alfredo Trombetti
(1866-1929), an Italian linguist who had developed a classification scheme for all the world's languages, widely reviled at the time
[15]
and subsequently ignored by almost all linguists. In Trombetti's time, a widely held view on classifying languages was that similarity in inflections is the surest proof of
genetic relationship
. In the interim, the view had taken hold that the
comparative method
—previously used as a means of studying languages already known to be related and without any thought of classification
[16]
—is the most effective means to establish genetic relationship, eventually hardening into the conviction that it is the only legitimate means to do so. This view was basic to the outlook of the new Nostraticists. Although Illich-Svitych adopted many of Trombetti's etymologies, he sought to validate them by a systematic comparison of the sound systems of the languages concerned.
Constituent language families
[
edit
]
The language families proposed for inclusion in Nostratic vary, but all Nostraticists agree on a common core of language families, with differences of opinion appearing over the inclusion of additional families.
The three groups universally accepted among Nostraticists are Indo-European,
Uralic
, and
Altaic
. While the validity of Altaic itself generally rejected by linguists, is taken for granted by Nostraticists. Nearly all also include the
Kartvelian
and
Dravidian language
families.
[17]
Following Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included
Afroasiatic
, though criticisms by
Joseph Greenberg
and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.
The
Sumerian
and
Etruscan
languages, regarded as
language isolates
by linguists, are thought by some
[
who?
]
to be Nostratic languages as well. Others, however, consider one or both to be members of another macrofamily called
Dené-Caucasian
. Another notional isolate, the
Elamite language
, also figures in a number of Nostratic classifications.
In 1987 Joseph Greenberg proposed a similar macrofamily which he called
Eurasiatic
.
[18]
It included the same "Euraltaic" core (Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic), but excluded some of the above-listed families, most notably Afroasiatic. At about this time Russian Nostraticists, notably
Sergei Starostin
, constructed a revised version of Nostratic which was slightly broader than Greenberg's grouping but which similarly left out Afroasiatic.
Beginning in the early 2000s, a consensus emerged among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).
Georgiy Starostin
(2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.
[19]
Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Kartvelian and Dravidian.
According to Greenberg, Eurasiatic and
Amerind
form a genetic node, being more closely related to each other than either is to "the other families of the Old World".
[20]
There are a number of hypotheses incorporating Nostratic into an even broader linguistic 'mega-phylum', sometimes called
Borean
, which would also include at least the Dené-Caucasian and perhaps the Amerind and
Austric
superfamilies. The term SCAN has been used for a group that would include Sino-Caucasian, Amerind, and Nostratic.
[21]
None of these proposed links have found wider acceptance outside of Nostraticists.

Proposed features of Proto-Nostratic
[
edit
]
According to
Dolgopolsky
, the Proto-Nostratic language had
analytic structure
, which he argues by diverging of post- and prepositions of auxiliary words in descendant languages.
Dolgopolsky states three lexical categories to be in the Proto-Nostratic language:
Lexical words
Pronouns
Auxiliary words
Word order was
subject-object-verb
when the
subject
was a noun, and
object-verb-subject
when it was a
pronoun
. Attributive (expressed by a lexical word) preceded its head. Pronominal attributive ('my', 'this') might follow the noun. Auxiliary words are considered to be
postpositions
.
Status within comparative linguistics
[
edit
]
The Nostratic hypothesis is not endorsed by the mainstream of
comparative linguistics
.
Nostraticists tend to refuse to include in their schema language families for which no proto-language has yet been reconstructed. This approach was criticized by
Joseph Greenberg
on the ground that genetic classification is necessarily prior to linguistic reconstruction,
[26]
but this criticism has so far had no effect on Nostraticist theory and practice.
Certain critiques have pointed out that the data from individual, established language families that is cited in Nostratic comparisons often involves a high degree of errors; Campbell (1998) demonstrates this for
Uralic
data. Defenders of the Nostratic theory argue that were this to be true, it would remain that in classifying languages genetically, positives count for vastly more than negatives (Ruhlen 1994). The reason for this is that, above a certain threshold, resemblances in sound/meaning correspondences are highly improbable mathematically.
Pedersen's original Nostratic proposal synthesized earlier macrofamilies, some of which, including
Indo-Uralic
, involved extensive comparison of inflections.
[27]
It is true the Russian Nostraticists initially emphasized lexical comparisons. Critics argue that were one to collect all the words from the various known Indo-European languages and dialects which have at least one of any 4 meanings, one could easily form a list that would cover any conceivable combination of two consonants and a vowel (of which there are only about 20×20×5 = 2000). Nostraticists respond that they do not compare isolated lexical items but reconstructed proto-languages. To include a word for a proto-language it must be found in a number of languages and the forms must be relatable by regular sound changes. In addition, many languages have restrictions on
root structure
, reducing the number of possible root-forms far below its mathematical maximum. These languages include, among others, Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic—all the core languages of the Nostratic hypothesis.  For a highly critical assessment of the work of the
Moscow School
, especially the work of Illich-Svitych, cf. Campbell and Poser 2008:243-264.
Campbell and Poser argue that Nostratic, as reconstructed by Illich-Svitych and others, is "typologically flawed". For instance, they point out that, surprisingly, very few Nostratic roots contain two voiceless stops, which are less marked and should therefore occur more frequently, and where such roots do occur, in almost all cases the second stop occurs after a sonorant.
[28]
In summary, Campbell and Poser reject the Nostratic hypothesis and, as a parting shot, state that they "seriously doubt that further research will result in any significant support for this hypothesized macro-family."
[29]
Proto-Indo-European
*b[h]ars-
seems to be a cultural loanword from Semitic (though several reputable Indo-Europeanists dispute this and consider it to be a native IE word). Much of the IE agricultural lexicon is not shared among all branches and seems to have been borrowed, thus supporting the view that the expansion of IE languages was post-Neolithic rather than a Neolithic one as postulated by Renfrew's theory.

Etymology
[
edit
]
The name of the mountain is derived from a nearby former mine called
Alte Drei Brüder
(Old Three Brothers) and originates in a legend, according to which three brothers from Italy had discovered a vein of silver ore there.
Buildings
[
edit
]
An 18 m tall
observation tower
was opened in May 1883 by the Marienberg branch of the
Ore Mountain Club
, founded in 1878. It had been constructed by Maschinenfabrik C. Reinsch, Dresden, at a cost of 6000
Mark
. In 1884 the tower was named
Prinzeß-Marien-Turm
after the wife of then
Prince Georg of Saxony
. It became a popular touristic destination, so that in 1886 Gustav Loose, a member of the Marienberg branch of the Ore Mountain Club, opened a restaurant in the nearby mining office (Huthaus)
Alte Drei Brüder
which had been erected in 1853/1854. The mountain restaurant
Dreibrüderhöhe
remained property of the Loose family until 1977, when it was sold to Gebäudewirtschaft Marienberg (the municipal real estate management) who operated it until 1985. It then passed into the hands of the Marienberg Agricultural Production Cooperative who sold it in 1992. In 1992/1993 it was rebuilt into a hotel (
Berghotel Drei Brüder Höhe
).
After access to the 1883 observation tower had been banned by the building inspectorate for several years, and because it stood near a restricted military area, it was pulled down and scrapped in 1977. Later the borough of Marienberg had a new 25.4 m tall observation tower built which was opened on 12 May 1994. It grants a good view across Marienberg and its surroundings.

Stained Class
is the fourth studio album by English
heavy metal
band
Judas Priest
, released on 10 February 1978 by
Columbia Records
. It is the first of three Judas Priest albums to feature drummer
Les Binks
, as well as the first to feature the band's now well-known logo. The album features "
Exciter
", considered an early precursor to
speed metal
and
thrash metal
,
[5]
as well as a cover version of "
Better by You, Better than Me
" by
Spooky Tooth
, which garnered the band a great deal of negative attention several years after its release when a pair of fans were allegedly influenced by the song to make a suicide pact. Nonetheless,
Stained Class
is regarded by some as one of Judas Priest's best albums.
[6]
[7]
Overview
[
edit
]
Stained Class
is the only Judas Priest album to feature songwriting by all five members of the band. Newly added drummer
Les Binks
earned a songwriting credit for "
Beyond the Realms of Death
",
[8]
and bassist
Ian Hill
received his first songwriting credit for co-writing "Invader" with vocalist
Rob Halford
and lead guitarist
Glenn Tipton
.
Artist
Rosław Szaybo
's cover artwork introduced the now-classic Judas Priest logo, replacing the
Gothic Script
logo which appeared on all of the band's previous albums.
Stained Class
was the first Judas Priest album to crack the
Billboard
200
chart and was eventually certified gold in the US.
Dennis MacKay was brought in by CBS Records to produce the album. His resume at the time consisted mainly of
jazz fusion
artists and more progressive rock artists such as
David Bowie
and
Supertramp
. The recording sessions for
Stained Class
took place in October and November 1977 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in
Oxfordshire
.
"
Better by You, Better than Me
" was a last-minute addition to the album when CBS Records insisted on including something with commercial potential to liven up an album they felt had a very dark and sinister tone. The song was recorded with producer
James Guthrie
separately from the rest of the album, as MacKay had moved on to other projects and was no longer available. The band was reportedly so impressed with Guthrie's production on "Better by You, Better than Me" that they asked him to produce their next album,
Killing Machine
.

In 2017, it was ranked 43rd in
Rolling Stone

After the success of subsequent Judas Priest albums in the US,
Stained Class
would eventually be certified Gold.

The song "Invader" was finally added to the band's setlists in 2021, making "Heroes End" the only song off the album that has never been performed live.
[12]
Lawsuit
[
edit
]
Twelve years after its release,
Stained Class
was the subject of a
1990 civil action brought against the band
by the family of a teenager, James Vance, who entered into a
suicide pact
with his friend Ray Belknap after allegedly listening to "
Better by You, Better than Me
" on 23 December 1985. Belknap succeeded in killing himself, and Vance was left critically injured after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot to the face, eventually dying of a
methadone
overdose three years later. The suit alleged that Judas Priest recorded subliminal messages on the song that said "do it". The suit was eventually dismissed. The song was originally written and performed by the band
Spooky Tooth
.
Three weeks after the lawsuit wrapped up, the band kicked off their Painkiller Tour by playing "Better by You, Better than Me" on the first concert in
Burbank, California
on 13 September. It constitutes Judas Priest's only live performance of the song since 1979.
Comedian
Bill Hicks
ridiculed the lawsuit as part of his act, pointing out (as many others have also done) the absurdity of the notion that a successful band would wish to kill off their purchasing fanbase.
[13]
Chuck Schuldiner
from the metal band
Death
has
that the song "Lack of Comprehension" from their 1991 release
Human
is based on the lawsuit.

In 2000, pieces of the meteorite were included in an art installation for The

Discovery
[
edit
]
The fall of the meteorite might have been observed in 1516, but it is difficult to assess if this event is connected with the pieces that were retrieved in 1958.
[2]
The meteorite burst during passage through the atmosphere and the pieces were scattered in a
strewn field
28 kilometres (17 mi) long and 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) wide near the city of
Nantan
,
Nandan County
,
Guangxi
(
China
).
[2]
The meteorite was named after the city.
The fragments were not retrieved until the 1950s when they were gathered for
smelting
to make metal for the growing industrialization of China. It was found that the
meteoric iron
contained too much
nickel
for
smelting
.
[2]
Description and Classification
[
edit
]
The Nantan meteorite was classified as an IIICD in 2000, but was reclassified as an IAB-MG in 2006. 9,500 kilograms (20,900 lb) have been retrieved, the largest fragment having a mass of 2,000 kilograms (4,400 lb). Most fragments show strong signs of weathering, due to the long time it took to retrieve them. The
meteoric iron
has a Nickel concentration of 6.96%.

Australian politician
Daniel Fisher
(11 November 1812 - 2 June 1884) was a
grain merchant
and politician in the young colony of South Australia.
History
[
edit
]
Daniel Fisher was born in
Bradford, Wiltshire
, son of James Fisher (1785-1837) and his wife Sarah Fisher (c. 1787- ), and was transported to Van Diemen's Land (
Tasmania
) aged 15, for what he was later to describe as "an unfortunate mistake" and "a boyish escapade, involving no moral offence" for which he was later exonerated and, on a petition from
John Baker
received a
Royal Pardon
. He married Harriet Brown in
Hobart Town
on 6 November 1837 (Rev. William Bedford officiating) and moved to South Australia aboard the
Timbo
, arriving at
Port Adelaide
in April 1846.
He set up in business as a cornfactor and seedsman (grain merchant) in
Rundle Street
. His brother Charles arrived in Adelaide in 1848, for a time working as a contractor then joined Daniel as "Fisher Brothers",
[1]
(not to be confused with the earlier hardware firm of the same name run by the unrelated
James Hurtle Fisher
). Charles left the partnership in October 1856 and set up in
Grenfell Street
on his own account. Daniel joined the gold rush to Victoria, but returned to Adelaide without having made a fortune. Other members of his family joined him in South Australia. He was convicted of assault after repeatedly charging his brother-in-law
George P. Harris
(co-founder of
Harris Scarfe
) on horseback and making threatening gestures.
[2]
In a letter to the
Adelaide Times
, D. Fisher stated that there was great provocation given.
[3]
Public life
[
edit
]
He was prominent in the defence of
John Stephens
, editor of the
South Australian Register
.
[4]
He served on the Adelaide City Council from 1852 to 1855 and retired from business in 1856. He visited England in 1861, and in 1865 contested the election for seat of
East Torrens
in the
South Australian House of Assembly
but was unsuccessful.  Two years later one of the successful candidates,
Neville Blyth
, resigned on a point of honour, and Fisher won the resulting by-election and served from July 1867 to May 1870.
[5]
His colleagues were
Randolph Isham Stow
, who resigned in May 1868 then
George Pearce
. He was elected Mayor of the
Town of Kensington and Norwood
in 1862.
[6]
Last years
[
edit
]
About 1878 Fisher suffered a
stroke
, which left him paralysed, and withdrew totally from public life. In the last year he lost the use of his mental faculties.
[7]
He died at his home Nile Street, Glenelg.

In the present, lawyer Helen Young receives a terminal diagnosis. She retrieves a painting by a famous
pulp magazine

In 1940s San Francisco, a group of

women try to avoid America's anti-LGBT laws while living Bohemian lives. These women include Loretta Haskel, the aforementioned artist; Emily Netterfield, a cross-dressing singer; Franny Travers, a
witch
with the power of
teleportation
, and Helen Young. Haskel and Emily meet at
Mona's 440 Club
and establish a relationship. Haskel's estranged husband Len returns to the city, seeking money; Haskel spurns him and asks Helen to initiate divorce proceedings. One night, Emily and Haskel decide to go dancing. Emily dresses as a man so the couple can avoid suspicion. As they leave a performance hall, Len attacks them. Emily pushes Len into the street, where he is killed by a car. The police arrive, but Emily escapes using Franny's powers.
Haskel uses a family heirloom to create a magical painting of the night in which she and Emily went dancing.

(

Pavia
, 3 April 2010) was an Italian
sports
journalist
and
TV presenter
.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
In print
[
edit
]
Zico
, who fells out with Mosca in 1983.
Son of the humorist, journalist and writer
Giovanni Mosca
, and brother of Antonello, Benedetto and the writer
Paolo Mosca
, Maurizio Mosca began working for the newspaper
La Notte
in
Milan
before moving to the
Gazzetta dello Sport
, where he spent twenty years as editor in chief and where he also served as the interim director for two years.
In 1983, the paper published an interview with
Zico
, who seldom granted interviews with Italian newspapers. Mosca declared that it had been made possible thanks to his close friendship with the footballer.
Later, during an appearance on
Il Processo del Lunedì
(The Monday Trial, most closely associated with its host,
Aldo Biscardi
), Mosca appeared with
Zico
. Biscardi asked Zico how he became a friend of Maurizio Mosca, to which the Brazilian responded: "I don't know this man".
Mosca's career at
Gazzetta dello Sport
ended immediately. On being forced to leave the newspaper. Mosca claimed to be the victim of a "plot", and that he was considered "dangerous" by certain members of the national football system.
TV
[
edit
]
Having commentated for
Domenica Sportiva
('Sunday Sport') since 1969, Mosca began working regularly in television in 1979, making his debut as the host of a sports programme on a regional channel in
Milan
. He featured in many television and radio shows, almost always about football, both regionally and nationally.
After his ejection from the press, Mosca began to work in the growing market of private TV sports programming.
The end of the 1980s saw the increased influence of
Silvio Berlusconi
's
Fininvest
, and Mosca supported
Cesare Cadeo
on
Calciomania
, shown on
Italia 1
. During the show, in addition to expressing opinions, Mosca played the role of satirical opportunist, inspired by the latest news from the world of football. He made his entrance on stage dressed in an apron, brandishing
tagliatelle
around the time of the "Case
Lipopill
" (when the players
Andrea Carnevale
and
Angelo Peruzzi
had attributed their failed drugs tests to dietary suppressant medication).
During the years of the great
A.C. Milan
team coached by
Arrigo Sacchi
, lit up by the magic of the Dutch trio
Marco van Basten
,
Ruud Gullit
and
Frank Rijkaard
, Mosca became a supporter of the "game to zone" and "total football". He was sufficiently successful to guarantee himself a position as a regular guest and pundit on
Guida al Campionato
(Guide to the Championship), a Sunday show hosted by a young
Sandro Piccinini
. Mosca specialized in
risky bets
, such as "forecast by pendulum".
One of his programmes intended for a wider audience was
L'Appello del Martedì
(The appeal of the Tuesday), in which he would appear on stage dressed in magistrate's robes and headgear.
Later came other appearances, in programmes such as
Controcampo
,
Zitti e Mosca
,
La Mosca al Naso
and he had a section on
Studio Sport
called
Ce l'ho con...
(I blame...) through which he expressed, as can be understood by the eloquent title, his disappointment towards a particular character of the sports landscape.
In 2002 he conducted the TV show
Senza Rete
(Without Net), broadcast on
Rete 4
, along with
Paolo Liguori
, also participated in this broadcast
Monica Vanali
and
Benedetta Massola
. Maurizio Mosca is then passed to conduct a television football program popular in
Lombardy
broadcast on
Antenna 3
.
On 11 May 2005 Mosca was a guest on the program
Carta Straccia,
shown Antenna 3 and hosted by
Roberto Poletti
. The theme of the programme was a complaint by Consumers Association (CODACONS) against the
wrestling
shows on TV. During the broadcast, in that occasion, Mosca entertains the public, improvising an improbable match with
wrestlers
from a local federation and a
transvestite
.
Mosca played himself in
Neri Parenti
's movies
Paparazzi
(1998) and
Tifosi
(1999), and he wrote an autobiographical book titled
La vita é rotonda... come un pallone da calcio
(Life is round... like a football), published by Rizzoli in 2001.
Illness and death
[
edit
]
Having been ill for a long time, Mosca died on the morning of 3 April 2010 at San Matteo Hospital in
Pavia
.
Two days before his death,
Sport Mediaset
published his final article, regarding the dispute between
José Mourinho
and
Mario Balotelli
. In the article, Mosca discussed the reintegration of Mario Balotelli at
Inter
and improved relations between the two.

17th-century Italian chemist and poisoner
Exili
(17th century) was an
Italian
chemist and poisoner. His real name was probably Nicolò Egidi.
[1]
Few authentic details of his life exist. Tradition, however, credits him with having been originally the salaried poisoner at Rome of
Olympia Maidalchina
, the sister-in-law of
Pope Innocent X
. Subsequently, he became a gentleman in waiting to
Queen Christina
of
Sweden
, whose taste for chemistry may have influenced this appointment.
[1]
In 1663 his presence in
France
aroused the suspicions of the French government, and he was imprisoned in the
Bastille
. Here he is said to have made the acquaintance of
Godin de Sainte-Croix
, the lover of the
marquise de Brinvilliers
. After three months of imprisonment, powerful influences secured Exili's release, and he left France for
England
. In 1681 he was again in Italy, where he married the countess Fantaguzzi, second cousin of Duke
Francesco II
of
Modena
.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Nicaraguan contra
In this
Spanish name
, the first or paternal
surname
is
Sánchez
and the second or maternal family name is
Herdocia
.
José Aristides Sánchez Herdocia
served as a key political figure among the
Nicaraguan
Contras
. Early on, he joined
Enrique Bermúdez
in efforts to start a rebel opposition to the new
Sandinista
government, a hand-picked choice of the
CIA
for this position.
[1]
As the conduit between political leader
Adolfo Calero
in Miami and rebel base camps in
Honduras
, he spent more time in the camps than other Contra politicians and had the trust of the rebel field commanders. After working largely behind the scenes, in 1987 he joined the directorate of the
Nicaraguan Resistance
.
Sánchez's Contra career embodied striking contrasts. He was the key ally of the Contra leaders most favored by the CIA and on the agency's payroll,
[2]
yet he himself was detested by the CIA. Unlike many Contra political leaders, chosen for their ability to woo American Congressmen, he did not speak English. He has been characterized as a Somocista oligarch, but also as an anti-American nationalist.
Sánchez came from a family that had been prominent in Nicaragua's Liberal Party early in the 20th century. Exiled by the 1979
Sandinista
Revolution, he joined Enrique Bermúdez in recruiting for the 15th of September Legion.
When the 15th of September Legion merged with the Nicaraguan Democratic Union in August 1981 to form the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force
, he joined the FDN's political triumvirate along with the UDN's
José Francisco Cardenal
and Mariano Mendoza. But when the FDN replaced the triumvirate with a directorate in late 1982, the CIA's hostility forced Sánchez to recede into background roles.
Sánchez became the key link between the political and military leadership of the FDN. He served as Calero's political enforcer in Honduras, while Bermúdez counted on him to be the military's advocate in the political councils of Miami. The tight alliance between the three men became known as the "iron triangle," but privately Sánchez felt he came from a more prominent family than Calero and resented serving under him.
In May 1987, he and Calero were elected to the directorate of the new rebel umbrella group, the Nicaraguan Resistance. Now on a more equal footing with Calero, he became a rival for power. As the "iron triangle" collapsed, he opposed Calero's effort to remove Bermúdez in 1988.
On November 15, 1990, the day after a clash between police and former rebels at the Sébaco bridge, he was arrested. He filed a complaint with the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
, charging that he had been coerced by torture and the withholding of medicine into signing false statements.
[1]
Sánchez died on September 6, 1993, at age 50, after battling cancer for two years. His widow, Cecilia, has continued to support the cause of demobilized resistance fighters.

Fatboy
was the first studio album by the
jam band
Moe
. It was first released in 1992 as a cassette of which only 1,000 were released. The band re-released the album in September 1999 on
CD
.
Recording
[
edit
]
The album was recorded in the Spring of 1991 at Happy House Studios, the second floor of an apartment in
Buffalo, NY
, which was owned/operated by Andrew Buscher. Over ten evenings, the album was recorded and mixed. The band used
sixteen track audio
for the recording and used
overdubs
for vocals and solos.
The band's original drummer, Ray Schwartz, left the group between the tracking and mixing in order to attend
graduate school
in
New Paltz, NY
. Soon after the album was finished, the band took on Jim Loughlin as their new drummer.
[2]
"Yodelittle" was re-recorded for 1994's
Headseed
while an updated recording of "Spine Of A Dog" was featured on
No Doy
in 1996. Both songs would go on to become standards of the band's live-set rotation, along with "Y.O.Y".

Explanation of some aspect of the natural world which can be tested and corroborated
For broader coverage of this topic, see
Theory
.
A
scientific theory
is an explanation of an aspect of the
natural world and universe
that can be (or
a fortiori
, that has been)
repeatedly tested
and corroborated in accordance with the
scientific method
, using accepted
protocols
of
observation
, measurement, and evaluation of results. Where possible, some theories are tested under controlled conditions in an
experiment
.
[1]
[2]
In circumstances not amenable to experimental testing, theories are evaluated through principles of
abductive reasoning
. Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and embody scientific
knowledge
.
A scientific theory differs from a
scientific fact
or
scientific law
in that a theory explains "why" or "how": a fact is a simple, basic observation, whereas a law is a statement (often a mathematical equation) about a relationship between facts and/or other laws. For example,
Newton’s Law of Gravity
is a mathematical equation that can be used to predict the attraction between bodies, but it is not a theory to explain
how
gravity
works.
[3]
Stephen Jay Gould
wrote that "...facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts."
[4]
The meaning of the term
scientific theory
(often contracted to
theory
for brevity) as used in the
disciplines of science
is significantly different from the common
vernacular
usage of
theory
.
[5]
[note 1]
In everyday speech,
theory
can imply an explanation that represents an unsubstantiated and speculative
guess
,
[5]
whereas in a scientific context it most often refers to an explanation that has already been tested and is widely accepted as valid.
[1]
[2]
The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain and its simplicity. As additional
scientific evidence
is gathered, a scientific theory may be modified and ultimately rejected if it cannot be made to fit the new findings; in such circumstances, a more accurate theory is then required. Some theories are so well-established that they are unlikely ever to be fundamentally changed (for example, scientific theories such as
evolution
,
heliocentric theory
,
cell theory
,
theory of plate tectonics
,
germ theory of disease
, etc.). In certain cases, a scientific theory or scientific law that fails to fit all data can still be useful (due to its simplicity) as an approximation under specific conditions. An example is
Newton's laws of motion
, which are a highly accurate approximation to
special relativity
at velocities that are small relative to the
speed of light
.
[6]
[7]
[8]
Scientific theories are
testable
and make verifiable
predictions
.
[9]
They describe the causes of a particular natural phenomenon and are used to explain and predict aspects of the physical
universe
or specific areas of inquiry (for example, electricity, chemistry, and astronomy). As with other forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are both
deductive
and
inductive
,
[10]
aiming for
predictive
and
explanatory power
. Scientists use theories to further scientific knowledge, as well as to facilitate advances in
technology
or
medicine
.
Types
[
edit
]
Albert Einstein
described two different types of scientific theories: "Constructive theories" and "principle theories". Constructive theories are constructive models for phenomena: for example,
kinetic theory
. Principle theories are empirical generalisations, one such example being Newton's laws of motion.

For any theory to be accepted within most academia there is usually one simple criterion.  The essential criterion is that the theory must be observable and repeatable.  The aforementioned criterion is essential to prevent fraud and perpetuate science itself.
The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century. Plate tectonic theory successfully explains numerous observations about the Earth, including the distribution of earthquakes, mountains, continents, and oceans.
The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge, including theories, is the ability to make
falsifiable
or testable
predictions
.
[12]
The relevance and specificity of those predictions determine how potentially useful the theory is. A would-be theory that makes no observable predictions is not a scientific theory at all. Predictions not sufficiently specific to be tested are similarly not useful. In both cases, the term "theory" is not applicable.
A body of descriptions of
knowledge
can be called a theory if it fulfills the following criteria:
It makes
falsifiable
predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry (such as
mechanics
).
It is well-supported by many independent strands of evidence, rather than a single foundation.
It is consistent with preexisting experimental results and at least as accurate in its predictions as are any preexisting theories.
These qualities are certainly true of such established theories as
special
and
general relativity
,
quantum mechanics
,
plate tectonics
, the
modern evolutionary synthesis
, etc.
Other criteria
[
edit
]
In addition, most scientists prefer to work with a theory that meets the following qualities:
It can be subjected to minor adaptations to account for new data that do not fit it perfectly, as they are discovered, thus increasing its predictive capability over time.
[13]
It is among the most parsimonious explanations, economical in the use of proposed entities or explanatory steps as per
Occam's razor
. This is because for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives, because one can always burden failing explanations with
ad hoc
hypotheses
to prevent them from being falsified; therefore, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more
testable
.
[14]
[15]
[16]
Definitions from scientific organizations
[
edit
]
The
United States National Academy of Sciences
defines scientific theories as follows:
The formal scientific definition of theory is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the Sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.
[17]
From the
American Association for the Advancement of Science
:
A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory". It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.
Note that the term
theory
would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even
scientific models.
Formation
[
edit
]
The first observation of
cells
, by
Robert Hooke
, using an early
microscope
.
[18]
This led to the development of
cell theory
.
The
scientific method
involves the proposal and testing of
hypotheses
, by deriving
predictions
from the hypotheses about the results of future experiments, then performing those experiments to see whether the predictions are valid. This provides evidence either for or against the hypothesis. When enough experimental results have been gathered in a particular area of inquiry, scientists may propose an explanatory framework that accounts for as many of these as possible. This explanation is also tested, and if it fulfills the necessary criteria (see above), then the explanation becomes a theory. This can take many years, as it can be difficult or complicated to gather sufficient evidence.
[

]
Once all of the criteria have been met, it will be widely accepted by scientists (see
scientific consensus
) as the best available explanation of at least some phenomena. It will have made predictions of phenomena that previous theories could not explain or could not predict accurately, and it will have many repeated bouts of testing. The strength of the evidence is evaluated by the scientific community, and the most important experiments will have been replicated by multiple independent groups.

Theories do not have to be perfectly accurate to be scientifically useful. For example, the predictions made by
classical mechanics
are known to be inaccurate in the relativistic realm, but they are almost exactly correct at the comparatively low velocities of common human experience.
[6]
In
chemistry
, there are many
acid-base theories
providing highly divergent explanations of the underlying nature of acidic and basic compounds, but they are very useful for predicting their chemical behavior.
[19]
Like all knowledge in science, no theory can ever be completely
certain
, since it is possible that future experiments might conflict with the theory's predictions.
[8]
However, theories supported by the scientific consensus have the highest level of certainty of any scientific knowledge; for example, that all objects are subject to
gravity
or that life on Earth
evolved
from a
common ancestor
.
[20]
Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be unfeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally with the term "theoretical". These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to the revision or rejection of the theory.As Feynman puts it:
It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.
[21]
Modification and improvement
[
edit
]
If experimental results contrary to a theory's predictions are observed, scientists first evaluate whether the experimental design was sound, and if so they confirm the results by independent
replication
. A search for potential improvements to the theory then begins. Solutions may require minor or major changes to the theory, or none at all if a satisfactory explanation is found within the theory's existing framework.
[22]
Over time, as successive modifications build on top of each other, theories consistently improve and greater predictive accuracy is achieved. Since each new version of a theory (or a completely new theory) must have more predictive and explanatory power than the last, scientific knowledge consistently becomes more accurate over time.
[

]
If modifications to the theory or other explanations seem to be insufficient to account for the new results, then a new theory may be required. Since scientific knowledge is usually durable, this occurs much less commonly than modification.
[8]
Furthermore, until such a theory is proposed and accepted, the previous theory will be retained. This is because it is still the best available explanation for many other phenomena, as verified by its predictive power in other contexts. For example, it has been known since 1859 that the observed
perihelion precession of Mercury
violates Newtonian mechanics,
[23]
but the theory remained the best explanation available until
relativity
was supported by sufficient evidence. Also, while new theories may be proposed by a single person or by many, the cycle of modifications eventually incorporates contributions from many different scientists.
[24]
After the changes, the accepted theory will explain more phenomena and have greater predictive power (if it did not, the changes would not be adopted); this new explanation will then be open to further replacement or modification. If a theory does not require modification despite repeated tests, this implies that the theory is very accurate. This also means that accepted theories continue to accumulate evidence over time, and the length of time that a theory (or any of its principles) remains accepted often indicates the strength of its supporting evidence.

Unification
[
edit
]
In
quantum mechanics
, the
electrons
of an atom occupy
orbitals
around the
nucleus
. This image shows the orbitals of a
hydrogen
atom (
s
,
p
,
d
) at three different energy levels (1, 2, 3). Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density.
In some cases, two or more theories may be replaced by a single theory that explains the previous theories as approximations or special cases, analogous to the way a theory is a unifying explanation for many confirmed hypotheses; this is referred to as
unification
of theories.
[7]
For example,
electricity
and
magnetism
are now known to be two aspects of the same phenomenon, referred to as
electromagnetism
.
[25]
When the predictions of different theories appear to contradict each other, this is also resolved by either further evidence or unification. For example, physical theories in the 19th century implied that the
Sun
could not have been burning long enough to allow certain geological changes as well as the
evolution
of life. This was resolved by the discovery of
nuclear fusion
, the main energy source of the Sun.
[26]
Contradictions can also be explained as the result of theories approximating more fundamental (non-contradictory) phenomena. For example,
atomic theory
is an approximation of
quantum mechanics
. Current theories describe three separate
fundamental phenomena
of which all other theories are approximations;
[27]
the potential unification of these is sometimes called the
Theory of Everything
.
[7]
Example: Relativity
[
edit
]
In 1905,
Albert Einstein
published the principle of
special relativity
, which soon became a theory.
[28]
Special relativity predicted the alignment of the Newtonian principle of
Galilean invariance
, also termed
Galilean relativity
, with the electromagnetic field.
[29]
By omitting from special relativity the
luminiferous aether
, Einstein stated that
time dilation
and
length contraction
measured in an object in relative motion is
inertial
—that is, the object exhibits constant
velocity
, which is
speed
with
direction
, when measured by its observer. He thereby duplicated the
Lorentz transformation
and the
Lorentz contraction
that had been hypothesized to resolve experimental riddles and inserted into electrodynamic theory as dynamical consequences of the aether's properties. An elegant theory, special relativity yielded its own consequences,
[30]
such as the
equivalence of mass and energy transforming into one another
and the resolution of the paradox that an excitation of the electromagnetic field could be viewed in one reference frame as electricity, but in another as magnetism.
[
citation needed
]
Einstein sought to generalize the invariance principle to all reference frames, whether inertial or accelerating.
[31]
Rejecting Newtonian gravitation—a
central force
acting instantly at a distance
—Einstein presumed a gravitational field. In 1907, Einstein's
equivalence principle
implied that a free fall within a uniform gravitational field is equivalent to
inertial
motion.
[31]
By extending special relativity's effects into three dimensions,
general relativity
extended length contraction into
space contraction
, conceiving of 4D space-time as the gravitational field that alters geometrically and sets all local objects' pathways.  Even massless energy exerts gravitational motion on local objects by "curving" the geometrical "surface" of 4D space-time. Yet unless the energy is vast, its relativistic effects of contracting space and slowing time are negligible when merely predicting motion. Although general relativity is embraced as the more explanatory theory via
scientific realism
, Newton's theory remains successful as merely a predictive theory via
instrumentalism
. To calculate trajectories, engineers and NASA still uses Newton's equations, which are simpler to operate.
[8]
Theories and laws
[
edit
]
See also:
Scientific law
Both scientific laws and scientific theories are produced from the scientific method through the formation and testing of hypotheses, and can predict the behavior of the natural world. Both are also typically well-supported by observations and/or experimental evidence.
[32]
However, scientific laws are descriptive accounts of how nature will behave under certain conditions.
[33]
Scientific theories are broader in scope, and give overarching explanations of how nature works and why it exhibits certain characteristics. Theories are supported by evidence from many different sources, and may contain one or several laws.
[34]
A common misconception is that scientific theories are rudimentary ideas that will eventually graduate into scientific laws when enough data and evidence have been accumulated. A theory does not change into a scientific law with the accumulation of new or better evidence. A theory will always remain a theory; a law will always remain a law.
[32]
[35]
[36]
Both theories and laws could potentially be falsified by countervailing evidence.
[37]
Theories and laws are also distinct from
hypotheses
. Unlike hypotheses, theories and laws may be simply referred to as
scientific fact
.
[38]
[39]
However, in science, theories are different from facts even when they are well supported.
[40]
For example,
evolution
is both a
theory and a fact
.
[5]
About theories
[
edit
]
Theories as axioms
[
edit
]
The
logical positivists
thought of scientific theories as statements in a
formal language
.
First-order logic
is an example of a formal language. The logical positivists envisaged a similar scientific language. In addition to scientific theories, the language also included observation sentences ("the sun rises in the east"), definitions, and mathematical statements. The phenomena explained by the theories, if they could not be directly observed by the senses (for example,
atoms
and
radio waves
), were treated as theoretical concepts. In this view, theories function as
axioms
: predicted observations are derived from the theories much like
theorems
are derived in
Euclidean geometry
. However, the predictions are then tested against reality to verify the predictions, and the "axioms" can be revised as a direct result.
[
citation needed
]
The phrase "
the received view of theories
" is used to describe this approach. Terms commonly associated with it are "
linguistic
" (because theories are components of a language) and "
syntactic
" (because a language has rules about how symbols can be strung together). Problems in defining this kind of language precisely, e.g., are objects seen in microscopes observed or are they theoretical objects, led to the effective demise of logical positivism in the 1970s.

Theories as models
[
edit
]
Main article:
Scientific model
The
semantic view of theories
, which identifies scientific theories with
models
rather than
propositions
, has replaced the received view as the dominant position in theory formulation in the philosophy of science.
[41]
[42]
[43]
A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country.
[44]
[45]
Precession
of the
perihelion
of
Mercury
(exaggerated). The deviation in Mercury's position from the Newtonian prediction is about 43
arc-seconds
(about two-thirds of 1/60 of a
degree
) per century.
[46]
[47]
In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria (see
above
). One can use language to describe a model; however, the theory is the model (or a collection of similar models), and not the description of the model. A model of the solar system, for example, might consist of abstract objects that represent the sun and the planets. These objects have associated properties, e.g., positions, velocities, and masses. The model parameters, e.g., Newton's Law of Gravitation, determine how the positions and velocities change with time. This model can then be tested to see whether it accurately predicts future observations; astronomers can verify that the positions of the model's objects over time match the actual positions of the planets. For most planets, the Newtonian model's predictions are accurate; for
Mercury
, it is slightly inaccurate and the model of
general relativity
must be used instead.
[
citation needed
]
The word "
semantic
" refers to the way that a model represents the real world. The representation (literally, "re-presentation") describes particular aspects of a phenomenon or the manner of interaction among a set of phenomena. For instance, a scale model of a house or of a solar system is clearly not an actual house or an actual solar system; the aspects of an actual house or an actual solar system represented in a scale model are, only in certain limited ways, representative of the actual entity. A scale model of a house is not a house; but to someone who wants to
learn about
houses, analogous to a scientist who wants to understand reality, a sufficiently detailed scale model may suffice.
Differences between theory and model
[
edit
]
Main article:
Conceptual model
Several commentators
[48]
have stated that the distinguishing characteristic of theories is that they are explanatory as well as descriptive, while models are only descriptive (although still predictive in a more limited sense). Philosopher
Stephen Pepper
also distinguished between theories and models, and said in 1948 that general models and theories are predicated on a "root" metaphor that constrains how scientists theorize and model a phenomenon and thus arrive at testable hypotheses.
[
citation needed
]
Engineering practice makes a distinction between "mathematical models" and "physical models"; the cost of fabricating a physical model can be minimized by first creating a mathematical model using a computer software package, such as a
computer aided design
tool. The component parts are each themselves modelled, and the fabrication tolerances are specified. An
exploded view drawing
is used to lay out the fabrication sequence. Simulation packages for displaying each of the subassemblies allow the parts to be rotated, magnified, in realistic detail. Software packages for creating the bill of materials for construction allows subcontractors to specialize in assembly processes, which spreads the cost of manufacturing machinery among multiple customers.

Assumptions in formulating theories
[
edit
]
An assumption (or
axiom
) is a statement that is accepted without evidence. For example, assumptions can be used as premises in a logical argument.
Isaac Asimov
described assumptions as follows:
...it is incorrect to speak of an assumption as either true or false, since there is no way of proving it to be either (If there were, it would no longer be an assumption). It is better to consider assumptions as either useful or useless, depending on whether deductions made from them corresponded to reality...Since we must start somewhere, we must have assumptions, but at least let us have as few assumptions as possible.
[49]
Certain assumptions are necessary for all empirical claims (e.g. the assumption that
reality
exists). However, theories do not generally make assumptions in the conventional sense (statements accepted without evidence). While assumptions are often incorporated during the formation of new theories, these are either supported by evidence (such as from previously existing theories) or the evidence is produced in the course of validating the theory. This may be as simple as observing that the theory makes accurate predictions, which is evidence that any assumptions made at the outset are correct or approximately correct under the conditions tested.
[
citation needed
]
Conventional assumptions, without evidence, may be used if the theory is only intended to apply when the assumption is valid (or approximately valid). For example, the
special theory of relativity
assumes an
inertial frame of reference
. The theory makes accurate predictions when the assumption is valid, and does not make accurate predictions when the assumption is not valid. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the
general theory of relativity
works in non-inertial reference frames as well).
The term "assumption" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as
assumere
("accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp"), which is a conjunction of
ad-
("to, towards, at") and
sumere
(to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian
assumere
and Spanish
sumir
. The first sense of "assume" in the OED is "to take unto (oneself), receive, accept, adopt". The term was originally employed in religious contexts as in "to receive up into heaven", especially "the reception of the Virgin Mary into heaven, with body preserved from corruption", (1297 CE) but it was also simply used to refer to "receive into association" or "adopt into partnership". Moreover, other senses of assumere included (i) "investing oneself with (an attribute)", (ii) "to undertake" (especially in Law), (iii) "to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess", and (iv) "to suppose a thing to be" (all senses from OED entry on "assume"; the OED entry for "assumption" is almost perfectly symmetrical in senses). Thus, "assumption" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of "that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate" (only the 11th of 12 senses of "assumption", and the 10th of 11 senses of "assume").
Descriptions
[
edit
]
From philosophers of science
[
edit
]
Karl Popper
described the characteristics of a scientific theory as follows:
[9]
It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory—if we look for confirmations.
Confirmations should count only if they are the result of risky predictions; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in question, we should have expected an event which was incompatible with the theory—an event which would have refuted the theory.
Every "good" scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is.
A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice.
Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it. Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks.
Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of "corroborating evidence".)
Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, might still be upheld by their admirers—for example by introducing post hoc (after the fact) some auxiliary hypothesis or assumption, or by reinterpreting the theory post hoc in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status, by
tampering with evidence
. The temptation to tamper can be minimized by first taking the time to write down the testing protocol before embarking on the scientific work.
Popper summarized these statements by saying that the central criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its "falsifiability, or refutability, or testability".
[9]
Echoing this,
Stephen Hawking
states, "A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations." He also discusses the "unprovable but falsifiable" nature of theories, which is a necessary consequence of inductive logic, and that "you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory".
[50]
Several philosophers and historians of science have, however, argued that Popper's definition of theory as a set of falsifiable statements is wrong
[51]
because, as
Philip Kitcher
has pointed out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of "theory", observations of Uranus when first discovered in 1781 would have "falsified" Newton's celestial mechanics. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed.
Kitcher agrees with Popper that "There is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail."
[52]
He also says that scientific theories include statements that cannot be falsified, and that good theories must also be creative. He insists we view scientific theories as an "elaborate collection of statements", some of which are not falsifiable, while others—those he calls "auxiliary hypotheses", are.
According to Kitcher, good scientific theories must have three features:
[52]
Unity: "A science should be unified.... Good theories consist of just one problem-solving strategy, or a small family of problem-solving strategies, that can be applied to a wide range of problems."
Fecundity
: "A great scientific theory, like Newton's, opens up new areas of research.... Because a theory presents a new way of looking at the world, it can lead us to ask new questions, and so to embark on new and fruitful lines of inquiry.... Typically, a flourishing science is incomplete. At any time, it raises more questions than it can currently answer. But incompleteness is not vice. On the contrary, incompleteness is the mother of fecundity.... A good theory should be productive; it should raise new questions and presume those questions can be answered without giving up its problem-solving strategies."
Auxiliary hypotheses that are independently testable: "An auxiliary hypothesis ought to be testable independently of the particular problem it is introduced to solve, independently of the theory it is designed to save." (For example, the evidence for the existence of Neptune is independent of the anomalies in Uranus's orbit.)
Like other definitions of theories, including Popper's, Kitcher makes it clear that a theory must include statements that have observational consequences. But, like the observation of irregularities in the orbit of Uranus, falsification is only one possible consequence of observation. The production of new hypotheses is another possible and equally important result.
Analogies and metaphors
[
edit
]
The concept of a scientific theory has also been described using analogies and metaphors. For example, the logical empiricist
Carl Gustav Hempel
likened the structure of a scientific theory to a "complex spatial network:"
Its terms are represented by the knots, while the threads connecting the latter correspond, in part, to the definitions and, in part, to the fundamental and derivative hypotheses included in the theory. The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by the rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of these interpretive connections, the network can function as a scientific theory: From certain observational data, we may ascend, via an interpretive string, to some point in the theoretical network, thence proceed, via definitions and hypotheses, to other points, from which another interpretive string permits a descent to the plane of observation.
[53]
Michael Polanyi
made an analogy between a theory and a map:
A theory is something other than myself. It may be set out on paper as a system of rules, and it is the more truly a theory the more completely it can be put down in such terms. Mathematical theory reaches the highest perfection in this respect. But even a geographical map fully embodies in itself a set of strict rules for finding one's way through a region of otherwise uncharted experience. Indeed, all theory may be regarded as a kind of map extended over space and time.
[54]
A scientific theory can also be thought of as a book that captures the fundamental information about the world, a book that must be researched, written, and shared. In 1623,
Galileo Galilei
wrote:
Philosophy [i.e. physics] is written in this grand book—I mean the universe—which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.
[55]
The book metaphor could also be applied in the following passage, by the contemporary philosopher of science
Ian Hacking
:
I myself prefer an Argentine fantasy. God did not write a Book of Nature of the sort that the old Europeans imagined. He wrote a
Borgesian
library, each book of which is as brief as possible, yet each book of which is inconsistent with every other. No book is redundant. For every book there is some humanly accessible bit of Nature such that that book, and no other, makes possible the comprehension, prediction and influencing of what is going on...Leibniz said that God chose a world which maximized the variety of phenomena while choosing the simplest laws. Exactly so: but the best way to maximize phenomena and have simplest laws is to have the laws inconsistent with each other, each applying to this or that but none applying to all.
[56]
In physics
[
edit
]
In
physics
, the term
theory
is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic
postulates
(usually symmetries—like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—that is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. A good example is
classical electromagnetism
, which encompasses results derived from
gauge symmetry
(sometimes called
gauge invariance
) in a form of a few equations called
Maxwell's equations
. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered to be adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested. An example of the latter might be the
radiation reaction force
. As of 2009, its effects on the periodic motion of charges are detectable in
synchrotrons
, but only as
averaged
effects over time. Some researchers are now considering experiments that could observe these effects at the instantaneous level (i.e. not averaged over time).
[57]
[58]
Examples
[
edit
]
Note that many fields of inquiry do not have specific named theories, e.g.
developmental biology
. Scientific knowledge outside a named theory can still have a high level of certainty, depending on the amount of evidence supporting it. Also note that since theories draw evidence from many fields, the categorization is not absolute.

The evolution of the states of the British Isles. Those states evolved from the conquests and mergers of earlier states.
The
formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
has involved
personal
and
political union
across
Great Britain
and the wider
British Isles
. The
United Kingdom
is the most recent of a number of sovereign states that have been established in Great Britain at different periods in history, in different combinations and under a variety of
polities
. Historian
Norman Davies
has counted sixteen different states over the past 2,000 years.
[1]
By the start of the 16th century, the number of states in Great Britain had been reduced to two: the
Kingdom of England
(which included Wales and controlled Ireland) and the
Kingdom of Scotland
. The once independent
Principality of Wales
fell under the control of English monarchs from the
Statute of Rhuddlan
in 1284. The
Union of Crowns
in 1603, the accidental consequence of a royal marriage one hundred years earlier, united the kingdoms in a
personal union
, though full political union in the form of the
Kingdom of Great Britain
required a
Treaty of Union
in 1706 and
Acts of Union
in 1707 (to ratify the Treaty).
The
Acts of Union 1800
united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the
Kingdom of Ireland
, which had been gradually brought under English control between 1541 and 1691, to form the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
in 1801. Independence for the
Irish Free State
in 1922 followed the
partition
of the island of
Ireland
two years previously, with six of the nine counties of the
province of Ulster
remaining within the UK, which then changed to the current name in 1927 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
In the 20th century, the rise of
Welsh
and
Scottish nationalism
and resolution of
the Troubles
in Ireland resulted in the establishment of
devolved
parliaments or assemblies for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

England's conquest of Wales
[

Main article:
Conquest of Wales by Edward I
Through internal struggles and dynastic marriage alliances, the Welsh became more united until
Owain Gwynedd
(1100-1170) became the first Welsh ruler to use the title
princeps Wallensium
(prince of the Welsh).
[2]
After invading England, land-hungry
Normans
started pushing into the relatively weak
Welsh Marches
, setting up a number of lordships in the eastern part of the country and the border areas. In response, the usually fractious Welsh, who still retained control of the north and west of Wales, started to unite around leaders such as Owain Gwynedd's grandson
Llywelyn the Great
(1173-1240), who is known to have described himself as "prince of all North Wales".
[3]
Llywelyn wrestled concessions out of the
Magna Carta
in 1215 and received the
fealty
of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi, becoming the first
Prince of Wales
. His grandson,
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
, also secured the recognition of the title
Prince of Wales
from
Henry III
with the
Treaty of Montgomery
in 1267. However, a succession of disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife
Eleanor
, daughter of
Simon de Montfort
, culminated in the first invasion by
Edward I
. Following a military defeat, the
Treaty of Aberconwy
in 1277 reasserted Llywelyn's fealty to the King of England.
In 1282, following another rebellion,
Edward I
finally made a permanent conquest.  With Llywelyn dead, the King took over his lands and dispossessed various other allied princes of northern and western Wales,
[4]
and across that area Edward established the
counties
of
Anglesey
,
Caernarfonshire
,
Flintshire
,
Merionethshire
,
Cardiganshire
and
Carmarthenshire
. The
Statute of Rhuddlan
formally established Edward's rule over Wales two years later although Welsh law continued to be used.  Remaining princes became marcher lords. Edward's son (later
Edward II
), who had been born in Wales, was made
Prince of Wales
. The tradition of bestowing the title "Prince of Wales" on the heir of the British Monarch continues to the present day. To help maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of great stone
castles
.
Initially, the Crown had only indirect control over much of Wales because the
Marcher lords
(ruling over independent lordships in most of the country) were independent from direct Crown control. The exception was the lands of the
Principality of Wales
in the north and west of the country, which was held personally by the King (or the heir to the Crown) but was not incorporated into the Kingdom of England.  However, between the 13th and 16th centuries the Crown gradually acquired most of the Marcher Lordships, usually through inheritance, until almost all of Wales came under Crown control. Nevertheless, the whole of Wales - that is, the Principality, Marcher Lordships held by the Crown and Marcher Lordships held by others - remained outside of the legal and constitutional structures of the Kingdom of England.
There was no major uprising except that led by
Owain Glyndŵr
a century later, against
Henry IV of England
. In 1404 Glyndŵr was crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain, and Scotland; he went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including
Machynlleth
. The rebellion was ultimately to founder, however. Glyndŵr went into hiding in 1412, and peace was more or less restored in Wales by 1415.
The power of the Marcher lords was ended in 1535, when the political and administrative union of England and Wales was completed. The
Laws in Wales Act 1535
annexed Wales to England and extended English law to Wales, abolished the marcher lordships and partitioned their lands into the
counties
of
Brecon
,
Denbigh
,
Monmouth
,
Montgomery
, and
Radnor
while adding parts to
Gloucester
,
Hereford
, and
Salop
. (Monmouthshire was wholly subsumed into the court structure of England and so omitted from the subsequent Laws in Wales Act of 1542, which led to ambiguity about its status as part of England or Wales.) The Act also extended the Law of England to both England and Wales and made English the only permissible language for official purposes. This had the effect of creating an English-speaking ruling class amongst the Welsh, at a time when Welsh was the language of the great majority. Wales was also now represented in Parliament at Westminster.
English Conquest of Ireland
[
edit

Main article:
History of Ireland
By the 12th century,
Ireland
was divided. Power was exercised by the heads of a few regional dynasties vying with each other for supremacy over the whole island. In 1155 Pope
Adrian IV
issued the papal bull
Laudabiliter
giving the Norman King
Henry II of England
lordship over Ireland. The bull granted Henry the right to invade Ireland in order to reform Church practices. When the King of
Leinster
Diarmuid MacMorroug
was forcibly exiled from his kingdom by the new High King,
Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair
, he obtained permission from
Henry II of England
to use
Norman
forces to regain his kingdom. The
Normans
landed in Ireland in 1169, and within a short time Leinster was reclaimed by Diarmait, who named his son-in-law,
Richard de Clare
, heir to his kingdom. This caused consternation to
Henry
, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland.
The extent of Norman control of Ireland in 1300
With the authority of the papal bull Henry landed with a large fleet in 1171 and claimed sovereignty over the island. A peace treaty followed in 1175, with the Irish High King keeping lands outside Leinster, which had passed to Henry on the expected death of both Diarmait and de Clare. When the High King lost his authority Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son
John
with the title
Dominus Hiberniae
("Lord of Ireland") in 1185. When John unexpectedly became King of England, the Lordship of Ireland fell directly under the English Crown. The title of Lord of Ireland and King of England fell into personal union. Throughout the 13th century the policy of the English Kings was to weaken the power of the
Norman Lords
in Ireland.
There was a resurgence of
Gaelic
power as rebellious attacks stretched Norman resources. Politics and events in Gaelic Ireland also served to draw the settlers deeper into the orbit of the Irish. When the
Black Death
arrived in Ireland in 1348 it hit the English and Norman inhabitants who lived in towns and villages far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the countryside again. The English-controlled area shrunk back to the
Pale
, a fortified area around Dublin.
Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords adopted the Irish language and customs. Over the following centuries they sided with the indigenous Irish in political and military conflicts with England and generally stayed Catholic after the
Reformation
. The authorities in the Pale grew so worried about the "Gaelicisation" of Ireland that they passed special legislation banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes, or inter-marrying with the Irish. Since the government in Dublin had little real authority, however, the Statutes did not have much effect. By the end of the 15th century, the ruling English authority in Ireland had almost all disappeared.
In 1532,
Henry VIII
broke with
Papal
authority. While the English, the Welsh, and the Scots accepted
Protestantism
, the Irish remained Catholic. This affected Ireland's relationship with England for the next four hundred years since the English tried to re-conquer and colonise Ireland to prevent Ireland being a base for Catholic forces that were trying to overthrow the Protestant settlement in England.
From 1536, Henry VIII decided to conquer Ireland and bring it under crown control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. In 1541, he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full kingdom. Henry was proclaimed
King of Ireland
at a meeting of the Irish Parliament. With the institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. The re-conquest was completed during the reigns of
Elizabeth
and
James I
, after several bloody conflicts. However, the English were not successful in converting the Catholic Irish to the Protestant religion, and the brutal methods used by Crown authority to pacify the country heightened resentment of English rule.
From the mid-16th and into the early 17th century, Crown governments carried out a policy of
colonisation
known as
Plantations
. Scottish and English Protestants were sent as colonists to the provinces of
Munster
,
Ulster
, and the counties of
Laois
and
Offaly
. These settlers, who had a British Protestant identity, would form the ruling class of future British administrations in Ireland. A series of
Penal Laws
discriminated against all faiths other than the established (
Anglican
)
Church of Ireland
.
Personal Union: Union of the Crowns

The first
coat of arms
for
Great Britain
, as used in the
Kingdom of England
, from 1603
A 16th century map of
England
,
Scotland
,
Wales
and
Ireland
prior to unification
In August 1503
James IV
, King of Scots, married
Margaret Tudor
, the eldest daughter of
Henry VII of England
. Almost 100 years later, when
Elizabeth I
was in the last decade of her reign, it was clear to all that
James VI of Scotland
, the great-grandson of James IV and Margaret Tudor, was the only generally acceptable heir to the English throne. From 1601, Elizabeth I's chief minister
Sir Robert Cecil
maintained a secret correspondence with James in order to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. Elizabeth died on 24 March 1603, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day. Despite sharing a monarchy, Scotland and England continued as separate countries with separate parliaments for over one hundred more years.
James had the idealistic ambition of building on the personal union of the crowns of Scotland and England so as to establish a permanent
Union of the Crowns
under one monarch, one parliament, and one law. He insisted that English and Scots should "join and coalesce together in a sincere and perfect union, as two twins bred in one belly, to love one another as no more two but one estate". James's ambitions were greeted with very little enthusiasm, as one by one members of parliament rushed to defend the ancient name and realm of England. All sorts of legal objections were raised: all laws would have to be renewed and all treaties renegotiated. For James, whose experience of parliaments was limited to the stage-managed and semi-feudal Scottish variety, the self-assurance - and obduracy - of the English version, which had long experience of upsetting monarchs, was an obvious shock. The Scots were no more enthusiastic than the English because they feared being reduced to the status of Wales or Ireland. In October 1604, James assumed the title "King of Great Britain" by proclamation rather than statute, although
Sir Francis Bacon
told him he could not use the title in "any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance". The two realms continued to maintain separate parliaments. The
Union of the Crowns
had begun a process that would lead to the eventual unification of the two kingdoms. However, in the ensuing hundred years, strong religious and political differences continued to divide the kingdoms, and common royalty could not prevent occasions of internecine warfare.
James did not create a
British Crown
, but he did, in one sense at least, create the British as a distinct group of people. In 1607 large tracts of land in
Ulster
fell to the crown. A new Plantation was started, made up of Protestant settlers from Scotland and England. Over the years the settlers, surrounded by the hostile Catholic Irish, gradually cast off their separate English and Scottish roots, becoming British in the process, as a means of emphasising their "otherness" from their
Gaelic
neighbors. It was the one corner of the British Isles where Britishness became truly meaningful as a political and cultural identity in its own right, as opposed to a gloss on older and deeper national associations.
Ruling over the diverse kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland proved difficult for James and his successor
Charles
, particularly when they tried to impose religious uniformity on the Three Kingdoms. There were different religious conditions in each country.
King Henry VIII
had made himself head of the
Church of England
, which was reformed under
Edward VI
and became
Anglican
under Elizabeth I. Protestantism became intimately associated with national identity in England. Roman Catholicism was seen as the national enemy, especially as embodied in France and Spain. However, Catholicism remained the religion of most people in Ireland and became a symbol of native resistance to the Tudor re-conquest of Ireland in the 16th century. Scotland had a national church, the
Presbyterian
Church of Scotland
, although much of the
highlands
remained Catholic. With the support of the
Episcopalians
, James reintroduced bishops into the Church of Scotland against the wishes of the presbyterian party.
In 1625, James was succeeded by his son
Charles I
, who in 1633, some years after his
coronation
at
Westminster
, was crowned in
St Giles' Cathedral
,
Edinburgh
, with full Anglican rites. Opposition to his attempts to enforce Anglican practices reached a flashpoint when he tried to introduce a
Book of Common Prayer
. Charles's confrontation with the Scots came to a head in 1639, when he tried and failed to coerce Scotland by military means. In some respects, this revolt also represented Scottish resentment at being sidelined within the Stuart monarchy after James I's accession to the throne of England. It led to the
Bishop's Wars
.
Charles I
's accession also marked the beginning of an intense schism between King and Parliament. Charles's adherence to the doctrine of the
Divine Right of Kings
, a doctrine foreign to the English mentality he had inherited from his father, fuelled a vicious battle for supremacy between King and Parliament. Therefore, when Charles approached the Parliament to pay for a campaign against the Scots, they refused, declared themselves to be permanently in session and put forward a long list of civil and religious grievances that Charles would have to remedy before they approved any new legislation. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Ireland, Charles I's Lord Deputy there,
Thomas Wentworth
, had antagonised the native Irish Catholics by repeated initiatives to confiscate their lands and grant them to English colonists. He had also angered them by enforcing new taxes but denying Roman Catholics full rights as subjects. What made this situation explosive was his idea, in 1639, to offer Irish Catholics the reforms they had been looking for in return for them raising and paying for an Irish army to put down the Scottish rebellion. Although the army was to be officered by Protestants, the idea of an Irish Catholic army being used to enforce what was seen by many as tyrannical government horrified both the Scottish and the English Parliament, who in response threatened to invade Ireland.
Alienated by British Protestant domination and frightened by the rhetoric of the English and Scottish Parliaments, a small group of Irish conspirators launched the
Irish Rebellion of 1641
, ostensibly in support of the "King's Rights". The rising was marked by widespread assaults on the British Protestant communities in Ireland, sometimes culminating in massacres. Rumours spread in England and Scotland that the killings had the King's sanction and that this was a foretaste of what was in store for them if the King's Irish troops landed in Britain. As a result, the English Parliament refused to pay for a royal army to put down the rebellion in Ireland and instead raised its own armed forces. The King did likewise, rallying those
Royalists
(some of them members of Parliament) who believed that loyalty to the legitimate King was the most important political principle.
The
English Civil War
broke out in 1642. The Scottish
Covenanters
, as the Presbyterians called themselves, sided with the English Parliament, joined the war in 1643, and played a major role in the English Parliamentary victory. The King's forces were ground down by the efficiency of Parliament's
New Model Army
- backed by the financial muscle of the
City of London
. In 1646, Charles I surrendered. After failing to come to compromise with Parliament, he was arrested and executed in 1649. In Ireland, the rebel Irish Catholics formed their own government - Confederate Ireland with the intention of helping the Royalists in return for religious toleration and political autonomy. Troops from England and Scotland fought in Ireland, and Irish Confederate troops mounted an expedition to Scotland in 1644, sparking the
Scottish Civil War
. In Scotland, the Royalists had a series of victories in 1644-45 but were crushed with the end of the first English Civil War and the return of the main Covenanter armies to Scotland.
After the end of the second English Civil War, the victorious Parliamentary forces, now commanded by
Oliver Cromwell
, invaded Ireland and crushed the Royalist-Confederate alliance there in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. Their alliance with the Scottish Covenanters had also broken down, and the Scots crowned
Charles II
as king. Cromwell therefore embarked on a conquest of Scotland in 1650-51. By the end of the wars, the Three Kingdoms were a unitary state called the
English Commonwealth
, ostensibly a
republic
but having many characteristics of a
military dictatorship
.
While the Wars of the Three Kingdoms pre-figured many of the changes that would shape modern Britain, in the short term it resolved little. The
English Commonwealth
did achieve a compromise (though a relatively unstable one) between a monarchy and a republic. In practise power was exercised by Oliver Cromwell because of his control over the Parliament's military forces, but his legal position was never clarified, even when he became
Lord Protector
. While several constitutions were proposed, none were ever accepted. Thus the Commonwealth and
the Protectorate
established by the victorious Parliamentarians left little behind it in the way of new forms of government. There were two important legacies from this period: the first was that in executing King Charles I for
high treason
, no future British monarch could be under any illusion that perceived despotism would be tolerated, and the second was that the excesses of Army rule, particularly that of the Major-Generals, has left an abiding mistrust of military rule in the English speaking world.
Ireland and Scotland were occupied by the New Model Army during the Interregnum. In Ireland, almost all lands belonging to Irish Catholics were confiscated as punishment for the rebellion of 1641; harsh
Penal Laws
were also passed against this community. Thousands of Parliamentarian soldiers were settled in Ireland on confiscated lands. The Parliaments of Ireland and Scotland were abolished. In theory, they were represented in the English Parliament, but since this body was never given real powers, this was insignificant. When Cromwell died in 1658, the Commonwealth fell apart without major violence, and
Charles II
was restored as King of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Under the
English Restoration
, the political system returned to the constitutional position of before the wars: Scotland and Ireland were returned their Parliaments.
When
Charles II
died his Catholic brother
James
inherited the throne as James II of England and VII of Scotland. When he had a son, the Parliament of England decided to depose him in the
Glorious Revolution
of 1688. He was replaced not by his Roman Catholic son,
James Stuart
, but by his Protestant daughter and son-in-law,
Mary II
and
William III
, who became joint rulers in 1689. James made one serious attempt to recover his crowns, which ended with defeat at the
Battle of the Boyne
in 1690.
Formation of the Union

Acts of Union 1707

Main articles:
Treaty of Union
and
Acts of Union 1707
A published version of the Articles of Union, 1707
Deeper political integration was a key policy of
Queen Anne
(1702-14), who succeeded to the throne in 1702 as the last Stuart monarch of
England
and
Scotland
(she was also the only Stuart monarch of
Great Britain
). The Queen appointed Commissioners for the union on the part of Scotland and England respectively, and in 1706 they began negotiations in earnest, with agreement reached on the terms of a
Treaty of Union
on 22 July 1706.
[5]
The circumstances of Scotland's acceptance of the Bill are to some degree disputed. Scottish proponents believed that failure to accede to the Bill would result in the imposition of Union under less favourable terms, and the
Lord Justice Clerk
, James Johnstone later observed that
"As for giving up the legislative power, we had none to give up... for the true state of the matter was whether Scotland should be subject to an English ministry without the privilege of trade or be subject to an English Parliament with trade."
Months of fierce debate on both sides of the border were to follow, particularly in Scotland where debate could often dissolve into civil disorder, most notably by the notorious "
Edinburgh
Mob". The prospect of a union of the kingdoms was deeply unpopular among the Scottish population at large; however, following the financially disastrous
Darien Scheme
, the near-bankrupt
Parliament of Scotland
did accept the proposals.
In 1707, the Acts of Union received their
Royal assent
, thereby abolishing the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland and their respective parliaments to create a unified
Kingdom of Great Britain
with a single Parliament of Great Britain. Anne formally became the first occupant of the unified British throne, and Scotland sent 45 MPs to the new
parliament at Westminster
. Perhaps the greatest single benefit to Scotland of the Union was that she could enjoy
free trade
with England and her
possessions overseas
. For England's part, a possible ally for European states hostile to England had been neutralised while simultaneously securing a Protestant succession to the new British throne.
However, certain aspects of the former independent kingdoms remained separate. Examples of Scottish and English institutions that were not merged into the British system include
Scottish
and
English law
,
Scottish
and
English
banking systems, the
Presbyterian
Church of Scotland
and the
Anglican
Church of England
and the systems of education and higher learning. These remain separate.

Act of Union 1800
After the
Irish Rebellion of 1641
, Irish Catholics were barred from voting or attending the
Irish Parliament
. The new English Protestant ruling class was known as the
Protestant Ascendancy
. Towards the end of the 18th century the entirely Protestant Irish Parliament attained a greater degree of independence from the British Parliament than it had previously held. Under the
Penal Laws
no Irish Catholic could sit in the
Parliament of Ireland
, even though some 90% of Ireland's population was native Irish Catholic when the first of these bans was introduced in 1691. This ban was followed by others in 1703 and 1709 as part of a comprehensive system disadvantaging the Catholic community and to a lesser extent Protestant dissenters.
[6]
In 1798, many members of this dissenter tradition made common cause with Catholics in a rebellion inspired and led by the
Society of United Irishmen
. It was staged with the aim of creating a fully independent Ireland as a state with a republican constitution. Despite assistance from France, the
Irish Rebellion of 1798
was put down by British forces.
The legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was completed by the
Acts of Union 1800
passed by each parliament, uniting the two kingdoms into one, called "The
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
".
[7]
The twin Acts were passed in the
Parliament of Great Britain
and the
Parliament of Ireland
with substantial majorities achieved in Ireland in part (according to contemporary documents) through
bribery
, namely the awarding of
peerages
and
honours
to critics to get their votes.
[8]
Under the terms of the union, there was to be but one
Parliament of the United Kingdom
.
[9]
Ireland sent four lords spiritual (bishops) and twenty-eight lords temporal to the House of Lords and one hundred members to the House of Commons at Westminster. The lords spiritual were chosen by rotation, and the lords temporal were elected from among the peers of Ireland.
Part of the arrangement as a trade-off for Irish Catholics was to be the granting of
Catholic Emancipation
, which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by
King George III
, who argued that emancipating Roman Catholics would breach his
Coronation Oath
. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However, the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined its appeal.

The "disuniting" of the United Kingdom
[
edit
]
Main article:
Potential breakup of the United Kingdom
Irish alienation and independence
[
edit
]
The 19th century saw the
Great Famine
of the 1840s, during which one million
Irish people
died and over a million emigrated. Aspects of the United Kingdom met with popularity in Ireland during the 122-year union. Hundreds of thousands flocked to Dublin for the visits of
Queen Victoria
in 1900,
King Edward VII
and
Queen Alexandra
in 1903 and 1907, and
King George V
and
Queen Mary
in 1911. About 210,000 Irishmen fought for the United Kingdom in
World War I
, at a time when Ireland was the only home nation where conscription was not in force.
The 19th century and early 20th century saw the rise of
Irish Nationalism
, especially among the Catholic population. From the General Election of 1874 until the creation of the
Irish Free State
in 1922, the majority of MPs elected from Irish constituencies supported
Home Rule
, sometimes finding themselves holding the balance of power in the House of Commons. Frustrated by lack of political progress, an armed rebellion took place with the
Easter Rising
of 1916. Two years later, the more radical, republican party,
Sinn Féin
, won 73 of the 103 Irish constituencies. Sinn Féin had promised not to sit in the
UK Parliament
but rather to set up an Irish Parliament, known as the
First Dáil
, which declared Irish independence by reaffirming the 1916 declaration, leading to the subsequent
Irish War of Independence
. In 1921,
a treaty
was concluded between the British Government and a delegation of Irish leaders. Under the treaty,
Northern Ireland
would form a
home rule
state within the new
Irish Free State
unless it opted out. Northern Ireland had a majority Protestant population and opted out as expected. A
Boundary Commission
was set up to decide on the border between the two Irish states, though it was subsequently abandoned after it recommended only minor adjustments to the border.
The Irish Free State was initially a
British dominion
like Canada and South Africa with
King George V
as its head of state. Along with the other dominions, it received full legislative autonomy under the
Statute of Westminster 1931
. Renamed Ireland in 1937, it
declared itself a republic in 1949
and thereby ceased to be regarded as in the British Commonwealth having no constitutional ties to the United Kingdom.
The "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" continued in name until 1927 when it was renamed the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" by the
Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927
(although, strictly speaking, the Act only referred to the King's title and the name of Parliament). In 1948 a working party chaired by the
Cabinet Secretary
recommended that the country's name be changed to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster".
[10]
However, the
prime minister
did not favour the change and it was not made.
[11]
Despite increasing political independence from each other from 1922, and complete political independence since 1949, the union left the two countries intertwined with each other in many respects. Ireland used the
Irish Pound
from 1928 until 2001 when it was replaced by the
Euro
. Until it
joined the ERM
in 1979, the Irish pound was directly linked to the
Pound Sterling
.
Decimalisation
of both currencies occurred simultaneously on
Decimal Day
in 1971. Irish Citizens in the UK have a status almost equivalent to British Citizens. They can vote in all elections and even stand for parliament. British Citizens have similar rights to Irish Citizens in the Republic of Ireland and can vote in all elections apart from presidential elections and referendums. People from Northern Ireland can have a right to Irish citizenship.
[12]
[a]
Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. Since 1922, it has sometimes enjoyed self-government, and at other times has been ruled directly from Westminster. However, even while governing itself, it has always kept its representation in the United Kingdom Parliament, and has formed part of the country which, since 1927, has included "Northern Ireland" in its name.
Devolution
[
edit
]
Northern Ireland
[
edit
]
The
Northern Ireland Assembly
in its current guise was first elected on 25 June 1998 and first met on 1 July 1998. However, it only existed in "shadow" form until 2 December 1999 when full powers were
devolved
to the Assembly. The Assembly's composition and powers are laid down in the
Northern Ireland Act 1998
. The Assembly has both legislative powers and responsibility for electing the
Northern Ireland Executive
.
The Assembly has
authority to legislate
in a field of competences known as "transferred matters". These matters include any competence not explicitly retained by the Parliament at Westminster. Powers reserved by Westminster are divided into "excepted matters", which it retains indefinitely, and "reserved matters", which may be transferred to the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly at a future date.
Scotland
[
edit
]
A
Scottish Parliament
was convened by the
Scotland Act 1998
, following a
referendum in 1997
, in which the Scottish electorate voted for
devolution
. The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999. It has the
power to legislate
in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.
Wales
[
edit
]
The
National Assembly for Wales
was created by the
Government of Wales Act 1998
, which followed a
referendum
in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate
primary legislation
until limited law-making powers were gained through the
Government of Wales Act 2006
. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the
referendum on 3 March 2011
, making it possible for it to
legislate
without having to consult the UK
parliament
or the
Secretary of State for Wales
in the
20 topic areas that are devolved
.
In November 2019, the Assembly voted to change its name to
Senedd Cymru
or
the Welsh Parliament
, referred simply as the Senedd in both
Welsh
and
English
,
[13]
a name change that took effect from 6 May 2020.
[14]
Future
[

Prospect of Scottish independence
[
edit
]
Main article:
Scottish independence
In 2014,
55% of Scottish voters rejected leaving the UK in an independence referendum
. However, after the
2016 European Union membership referendum
, in which Scotland, as well as Northern Ireland, voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave, there is
the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum
. With some
polls on support for Scottish independence being in the majority
in 2020, however, polls have a margin of error and many do not include 16-17-year-olds like in the 2014 referendum.
Prospect of Welsh independence
[
edit
]
Main article:
Welsh independence
Wales voted to leave in the EU referendum. However, historically the support for Welsh independence has predominantly been low, ranging between 10% in 2013 and 24% in 2019. Since the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020, however, popular support has risen. One poll in March 2021 showed that, with "don't knows" removed, nearly 40% of Welsh people were in favour of independence.
[15]
Prospect of Irish reunification
[
edit
]
Main article:
Irish reunification
In 1973,
Northern Ireland
had a
referendum
on
Irish reunification
, though the result was in favour of the
United Kingdom
and the poll was boycotted by
Nationalists
. The
1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum
was then held to approve the
Good Friday Agreement
, which among other things, included a clause which states that a border poll on Irish reunification must be held if public opinion is shown to have changed in favour of a
United Ireland
.

The
Appalachian State Mountaineers football statistical leaders
are individual statistical leaders of the
Appalachian State Mountaineers football
program in various categories,
[1]
including
passing
,
rushing
,
receiving
,
total offense
, defensive stats,
kicking
, and scoring. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Mountaineers represent
Appalachian State University
in the
NCAA
Division I
FBS
Sun Belt Conference
.
Although Appalachian State began competing in intercollegiate football in 1928,
[1]
the school's official record book considers the "modern era" to have begun in 1957. Records from before this year are often incomplete and inconsistent, and they are generally not included in these lists.
These lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:
Since 1957, seasons in the top level of college football, now Division I FBS, have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.
From 1982 through 2013, Appalachian State played in the second level of Division I football, currently known as
Division I FCS
(known before the 2006 season as Division I-AA). While regular seasons at that level remain limited to 11 games in most years, two aspects of FCS rules allow for more games.
The NCAA organizes an FCS championship tournament, currently called the
NCAA Division I Football Championship
. The Mountaineers reached the FCS playoffs 20 times, playing 41 games, between 1986 and 2012 (they were ineligible for the 2013 playoffs due to their FBS transition), giving many players extra games to accumulate statistics. The NCAA did not count I-AA/FCS playoff games toward official season statistics until 2002. Since 2006, Appalachian has not included statistics from pre-2002 playoff games (19 in all) when compiling single-season and career records.
Additionally, current NCAA rules allow FCS teams to schedule 12 regular-season games in years when the period starting with the Thursday before Labor Day and ending with the final Saturday in November contains 14 Saturdays.
The NCAA did not count bowl games toward official season statistics until 2002 (at that time, Appalachian was in what is now known as FCS). The Mountaineers have appeared in a bowl game in each season since they were first eligible for such games in the 2015 season.
The Sun Belt Conference has held a
championship game
since 2018. Appalachian State played in and won the first two title games (
2018
and
2019
), providing yet another game for players to accumulate statistics in those seasons.
The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until
1972
(with the exception of the
World War II
years), allowing players to have four-year careers.
Due to
COVID-19
issues, the NCAA ruled that the 2020 season would not count against the athletic eligibility of any football player, giving everyone who played in that season the opportunity for five years of eligibility instead of the normal four.
[2]
These lists are updated through Appalachian's game against Coastal Carolina on November 3,
2022
.

Brand of electrical connector
19-pin Socapex connector
Socapex
is a brand of electrical connectors, known in the entertainment industry primarily for their 19-pin electrical connectors, commonly known as
Socapex connectors
, and used in film, television, and
stage lighting
to terminate the ends of a
multicable
. They are wired with six hot/live pins, six neutral pins, six ground/earth pins, and a final central pin used to aid alignment of the male end of the connector with a female receptacle.
[1]
The Socapex was first created by a company called Socapex in 1961, which later on became Amphenol Socapex.  "Socapex" became a brand name owned by Amphenol Socapex, the term "Soca" is now often applied to similar off-brand connectors as a
genericized trademark
.
"Breakouts" are often used to connect fixtures to the cable. The breakout consists of a male Socapex connector with six "tails" with female connectors such as
parallel blade receptacle
,
stage pin connector
,
IEC 60309
16 A, NEMA
L5-20P
&
L6-20P
'twist-lock',
BS 546
15 A,
PowerCon
or
Schuko
connectors, according to the standards of the region in which the assembly is being used. A "breakin" is the opposite, consisting of "tails" with male connectors such as Parallel Blade, stage pin connectors, IEC 60309 16 A, NEMA L5-20R & L6-20P 'twist-lock', BS 546 or Schuko connectors feeding a female Socapex connector. These are used to connect Socapex cables to dimmer packs that do not have Socapex outputs.
[2]
Male panel-mount 19-pin connector
Some fixtures and assemblies containing several lamps, such as
PARbars
, may use a panel mounted Socapex connector to avoid the need for a separate breakout, and many such fixtures also incorporate a female Socapex connector to allow further similar fixtures to be chained from the same supply.
Amphenol Socapex is still manufacturing and selling the original Socapex. These connectors are keyed to prevent insertion into a circuit with the wrong voltage, or to prevent insertion of audio cables on power circuits.

New Fort Boise, 2018
Fort Boise
is either of two different locations in the
Western United States
, both in
southwestern
Idaho
. The first was a
Hudson's Bay Company
(HBC) trading post near the
Snake River
on what is now the
Oregon
border (in present-day
Canyon County, Idaho
), dating from the era when Idaho was included in the British fur company's
Columbia District
. After several rebuilds, the fort was ultimately abandoned in 1854, after it had become part of United States territory following settlement in 1846 of the northern
boundary dispute
.
The second was established by the
U.S. government
in 1863 as a military post located fifty miles (80 km) to the east up the
Boise River
. It developed as
Boise
, which became the capital city of Idaho.

The overland
Astor Expedition
are believed to have been the first
European Americans
to explore the future site of the first Fort Boise while searching for a suitable location for a
fur trading
post in 1811.
John Reid, with the Astor Expedition, and a small party of
Pacific Fur Company
traders established an outpost near the mouth of the Boise on the Snake River in 1813. Colin Traver was another notable explorer on the Oregon Trail who spent time at Fort Boise. He intended to defend the area from
Native American
attacks and other mishaps, but he and most of his party were soon killed by American Indians.
Marie Dorion
, the wife of one those killed, and her two children,
[2]
escaped and traveled more than 200 miles in deep snow to reach friendly
Walla Walla
Indians on the
Columbia River
.
[3]
On an 1818 map, the explorer and mapmaker
David Thompson
of the
North West Company
(NWC) called the Boise, "Reid's River," and the outpost, "Reid's Fort".
[4]
Donald Mackenzie
, formerly with the Astor Expedition and representing the
North West Company
, established a post in 1819 at the same site. It was also abandoned because of Indian hostilities.
In the fall of 1834,
Thomas McKay
, a veteran leader of the annual
Hudson's Bay Company
(HBC) Snake Country brigades,
[5]
built Fort Boise, selecting the same location as Reid and Mackenzie. Although McKay had retired in 1833, the HBC Chief Factor
John McLoughlin
sent him to establish Fort Boise in 1834 to challenge the newly built American
Fort Hall
further east on the Snake River. McKay was the stepson of McLoughlin.
[5]
Fort Hall was located about 300 miles (500 km) to the east, about 30 miles (50 km) north of the location of present-day
Pocatello
. It was built by
Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth
's American Trading Company. In July 1834, Thomas McKay's Snake Country brigade was trapping far to the east and met the party sent by Wyeth to select a site and build Fort Hall. At the end of July, McKay departed for
Fort Vancouver
.
[6]
Although Fort Boise may technically have been built as a private venture of Thomas McKay, it was fully backed and supported by McLoughlin and the HBC.
[7]
The contest over the Snake Country ended with Wyeth's vacating the region in 1836-1837. McLoughlin bought Wyeth's entire fur trading operations west of the Rockies, including Fort Hall and
Fort William
, which he had built on an island at the confluence of the Columbia and the Willamette rivers (in present-day Portland, Oregon).
[8]
The HBC also took full control of Fort Boise in 1836.
[7]
The Hudson's Bay Company operated Fort Boise until its abandonment. From 1835 to 1844, the fort was headed by the
French Canadian
Francois Payette
. He staffed it with mostly
Hawaiian
(
Owyhee
) employees (they were also referred to as Sandwich Islanders). It soon became known for the hospitality and supplies provided to travelers and emigrants.
[9]
In 1838, Payette constructed a second Fort Boise near the confluence of the
Boise River
and
Snake River
about five miles (8 km) northwest of the present town of
Parma, Idaho
and south of
Nyssa, Oregon
.
[10]
The second Fort Boise was built in the form of a parallelogram one hundred feet per side, surrounded with a stockade of poles fifteen feet high. Later the logs were covered and replaced with sun-dried adobe bricks. In 1846, it had two tilled acres, twenty-seven cattle, and seventeen horses.
[11]
In 1853, a flood damaged the fort, and the following year the Shoshone attacked an emigrant train and killed nineteen pioneers; the incident known as the Ward massacre took place within a few miles of the fort.
[12]
The military deemed the fort indefensible and, with the demise of the fur trade, it was abandoned in 1854. Traders took stock and goods to
Flathead
country.
[13]
In 1866, the Oregon Steam and Navigation Company constructed and launched the
Shoshone
, a sternwheeler, at the old Fort Boise location. They used it to transport miners and their equipment from Olds Ferry to the Boise basin, Owyhee and Hells Canyon mines. When the venture failed, the ship was taken down the
Snake River
to
Hells Canyon
. Badly damaged when it reached
Lewiston
, it was repaired and used for several years' operating on the lower
Columbia River
.
[14]
The site of Old Fort Boise is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
; it is within the
Fort Boise Wildlife Management Area
. A reconstructed replica of the fort in the town of Parma is open to the public by appointment with the city office.

On July 4, 1863, the
Union Army
founded a new Fort Boise during the
Civil War
. (Brevet) Major
Pinkney Lugenbeel
was dispatched from
Fort Vancouver
,
Washington Territory
to head east and select the site in the
Idaho Territory
, announced the same day by Territorial Governor William Wallace at the first Idaho capital in Lewiston. The new location was 50 miles (80 km) to the east of the old Hudson's Bay Company fort, up the
Boise River
at the site that would develop as the city of
Boise
. The new military post was constructed because of massacres on the
Oregon Trail
after the old fort was abandoned.
The new fort was near the intersection of the Oregon Trail and the roads connecting the
Owyhee
(
Silver City
) and Boise Basin (
Idaho City
) mining areas, both booming at the time. The fort's site had the necessary combination of grass, water, wood, and stone.
With three companies of infantry and one of cavalry, Major Lugenbeel set to work building quarters for five companies. They built a mule-driven sawmill on Cottonwood Creek, got a lime kiln underway, and opened a
sandstone
quarry at the small
mesa
known as Table Rock. Lugenbeel's greatest problem was the lure of the Boise Basin mines - more than 50 men deserted within the first few months.
[15]
Other names for the fort were the Boise Barracks
[15]
and Camp Boise.
After 49 years at the fort, the U.S. Army left the site in 1912. The
National Guard
occupied it until 1919, when the
Public Health Service
obtained it for a center for veterans of
World War I
and
tuberculosis
patients. The foothills above Ft. Boise were used for gunnery practice. During rehab efforts following the Foothills Fire in 1997, firefighters found several unexploded 75 mm (2.95 in) artillery shells and other ordnance.
Post 1938
[
edit
]
In 1938, the
Veterans Administration
acquired the site. Its successor, the
DVA
, operates the Boise VA Medical Center. In 1957, the Idaho
Elks
Rehabilitation Hospital was built on a portion of the old fort's land. The Federal Building (and U.S. Court House), built in 1968, also occupies a section of the site. It was renamed for former
U.S. senator
Jim McClure
in December 2001.
Fort Boise Park
[

The City of Boise acquired a portion of the site in 1950 from the federal government after the
Defense Department
declared it
surplus
. Fort Boise Park was originally 40.37 acres (16.3 ha) in the old fort's southern corner, but in 1956, several acres were traded to the Idaho
Elks
organization (for their new hospital) in exchange for a site of approximately the same size of State Street. The site is currently about 33 acres (13 ha) in size.
Fort Boise Park has a community center, six lighted tennis courts, three lighted softball fields, and a regulation lighted
baseball diamond
(for
Boise High School
and
American Legion
league play only). A
skateboard park
is located in the northwest corner of the park.  It is below ground with transition walls varying in height from 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 m).
The final "
wild west show
" scene of the
Clint Eastwood
movie
Bronco Billy
was filmed in Fort Boise Park in October 1979.

Influences
Pierre Guillaume Frédéric le Play
Paul de Rousiers
(16 January 1857 - 28 March 1934) was a French social economist and industrial lobbyist.
He was a follower of
Pierre Guillaume Frédéric le Play
, and believed in industrial syndicates that would be independent of both workers and owners, and would be dedicated to the progress of their industries.
He undertook studies of society and economic organization in the United States, Britain and Germany, where he visited the rural areas, towns, cities, farms, mines and factories, and spoke to workers, owners, politicians and intellectuals to gain an understanding of the interplay of social and economic forces.
His work gained him considerable respect.
In 1903 Paul de Rousiers became secretary-general of the French shipowners' association, a position he held for most of the rest of his life.
In this role he proved a highly effective lobbyist.
He also provided valuable information and legal services to the members, and helped in their negotiations with trade unions.
He remained involved in social economics, and taught a course at the École libre des sciences politiques.
Paul de Rousiers was a prolific author throughout his career, publishing many books and articles.
Life
[
edit
]
Early years
[
edit
]
Marie Pierre Paul de Rousiers was born in
Rochechouart
, Haute-Vienne, on 16 January 1857.
[1]
His father, a graduate of the naval school, was an officer in the navy and owned an agricultural estate in Rhus, in the commune of
Saint-Maurice-des-Lions
, where Les Rousiers had lived for several generations. 
This is where Paul spent his childhood. 
After the death of his father in 1865 he entered the Jesuit college in Poitiers and obtained his
baccalauréat
in 1872.
He then prepared for the examination for admission to the Naval School in
Brest
, which he failed twice.
[2]
De Rousiers turned to the study of the law at the Catholic Institute in Paris.
His professor of political economy, Claudio Jannet, was a disciple of
Pierre Guillaume Frédéric le Play
, head of the Société d'économie sociale and the Unions de la paix sociale.
De Rousiers met Le Play through
Edmond Demolins
, through whom he joined the group that met in Le Play's salon every Monday.
[2]
De Rousiers pursued his study of law and obtained a license, and also worked in 1877 as chief of staff to the prefect of
Aveyron
, while continuing to study social science.
His theoretical apprenticeship ended with the publication in 1881 of the
Programme de gouvernement et d'organisation sociale d'après l'observation comparée des divers peuples
, with a preface by Le Play. This was a collective work by the small group led by Demolins.
[3]
Social economist
[
edit
]
Paul de Rousiers married Camille d'Artigues in May 1879.
He joined the Société d'économie sociale and the Unions de la paix sociale, and from this time was committed to development of social science.
From 1883 he became a regular contributor to
Réforme sociale
, a bi-monthly journal edited by Demolins.
[3]
The term "
social geography
" was first used both by geographer
Élisée Reclus
and by sociologists of the Le Play School, perhaps independently. 
The first proven occurrence of the term derives from a review of Reclus'
Nouvelle géographie universelle
from 1884, written by Paul de Rousiers, a member of the Le Play School.
[

]
In 1885, three years after the death of Le Play, Henri de Tourville and Demolins split from the movement and founded a new journal,
Science sociale
.
They brought with them a few adherents including de Rousiers and
Robert Pinot
(1862-1926), future director of the
Musée social
and secretary-general of the
Comité des forges
.
De Rousiers continued to work within this small group, which functioned as a true research team.
[4]
The publisher Firmin-Didot provided funding for Paul de Rousiers to visit the United States from March to June 1890.
He wrote of what he found in
La Vie américaine
(1892), an analysis of American society based on deliberate investigation including visits to factories and farms, observations of life in the cities and countryside, and interviews with representatives of different social groups including owners, workers, politicians, officials and professionals.
His goal was to understand the sociological forces behind the growing economic power of the US, which was starting to cause serious concern in Europe.
[5]
De Rousiers interviewed
George Pullman
, who exerted  huge control over the workforce who lived in his Pullman City.
[6]
He wrote of Pullman's manufacturing complex, "Everything is done in order and with precision. One feels that some brain of superior intelligence, backed by a long technical experience, has thought out every possible detail."
[7]
The book appeared in English in 1892, translated by the geographer
Andrew John Herbertson
.
[5]
Frontispiece of
La question ouvrière en Angleterre
(1895)
In 1893 de Rousiers made two visits of four months to England and Scotland, then to Belfast, where in September 1893 he participated in a trade union congress.
[8]
As in America, he made many observations, particularly in
Birmingham
,
London
and the Scottish
Lothians
, visited factories and mines, and interviewed workers, industrialists, union leaders and intellectuals such as
Sidney Webb
.
[9]
Based his investigation he produced a major work on
La question ouvrière en Angleterre
(1895), translated as
The Labour Question in Britain
(1896).
[10]
Le Trade-unionisme en Angleterre
(1896) was a collective work that Paul de Rousiers organized at the request of the directors of the
Musée social
.
[11]
Robert Pinot, the effective leader of the Musée and a close friend of de Rousiers, had placed him at the head of a team of four pupils of the
École Libre des Sciences Politiques
who conducted inquiries in September and October 1895.
[12]
The Musée social supported a second study on the same subject in the US from July to December 1896.
De Rousiers led a team that included F. de Carbonnel, Pierre Claudio-Jannet and
Louis Vigouroux
.
This resulted in several articles and two books,
La Concentration des forces ouvrières dans l'Amérique du Nord
by Vigouroux and
Les Industries monopolisées (trusts) aux Etats-Unis
by de Rousiers.
[12]
Frontispiece of
Les Syndicats industriels de producteurs en France et à l'étranger
(1901)
After his second visit to the United States Paul de Rousier's reputation was established.
He was invited to contribute to reviews such as the
Revue politique et parlementaire
,
Revue de Paris
,
Revue bleue
and
Annales des sciences politiques
, while continuing to contribute to
la Science sociale
.
[13]
In 1899 and 1900 he studied the German cartels in two journeys through the
Ruhr
, the plains of
Saxony
and
Silesia
.
He then investigated the
Comptoir métallurgique de Longwy
, formed in 1877 by the main enterprises of
Lorraine
to coordinate purchase and allocation of pig iron.
Based on this research he published
Les Syndicats industriels de producteurs en France et à l'étranger
(1901).
[14]
His last important work about industrial relations was
Hambourg et l'Allemagne contemporaine
(1902).
[15]
Lobbyist
[
edit
]
Édouard Gruner
, mining engineer and vice-president of the
Comité central des houillères
, was an active member of the Société d'économie sociale and secretary-treasurer of the Musée social.
He had already introduced Robert Pinot to the metallurgy manufacturers who were looking for a leader for their trade association, and did the same for de Rousiers by putting him in contact with the shipbuilders, who wanted to found a professional association.
De Rousiers was engaged in 1903 by
André Lebon
, former minister of Commerce and then of the Colonies, and first president of the Comité central des armateurs de France (CCAF: Central Committee of French Shipowners).
[16]
De Rousiers was secretary-general and vice-president-delegate of the committee.
[17]
He now had stable employment that allowed him to rebuild his family home in Rhus and provide education to his five children.
The CCAF was an owners' association typical of the time with the purpose of studying and defending the common interests of the shipowners.
Within a year it represented 98% of the industry.
De Rousiers quickly established a service to gather French and foreign information, which he described in March 1910,
[18]
The information service of the Shipowners' Committee is not conceived in an academic spirit but in a spirit of practical use. We do not intend to constitute a compendium of jurisprudence or a compendium of statistics; We strive to point out to you all that seems likely to have an impact on your industry, anything that threatens your general interests, anything that is of a nature to serve them.
The information service and a legal section both were frequently consulted by the shipowners.
With his considerable intellectual authority, de Rousiers was an effective defender of the interests of the shipowners and contributed to discussions on legislative project. 
At times he was criticized for being too effective in his lobbying.
[19]
During
World War I
(1914-18) there was an enforced truce between the shipowners and the labor unions, with the state as mediator.
As soon as the armistice was declared the shipowners, led by the committee, reasserted their independence in negotiating wages.
De Rousiers justified this position,
[19]
Conditions vary according to the region; Working conditions vary according to traffic and categories of vessels. Remuneration also depends on the possibilities of each company. How could it be conceived that, in the midst of a crisis, a professional trade union would be forced, by submitting to such an arbitration procedure, to impose new burdens on all its members which might exceed the limit of what some can bear? It would be a lack of clairvoyance.
In 1923 the
Société d'études et d'informations économiques
, formed by the
Comité des forges
, published studies by de Rousiers defending "good" agreements.
[20]
De Rousiers represented the shipowners in the Standing Joint Committee on Merchant Shipping, established in 1925, which had the purpose of examining issues that could cause conflicts between owner and workers.
He also represented the owners on the Joint International Maritime Committee led by
Albert Thomas
, which sought to establish international status for seafarers.
He participated in the International Maritime Conferences organized by the
International Labor Office
in
Genoa
(1920) and
Geneva
(1926), where the main interlocutor was
Havelock Wilson
of Britain, head of the International Federation of Seafarers' Unions.
[21]
In 1930, although not a shipowner, de Rousiers was elected vice-president of the Comité central des armateurs.
[18]
Other activities
[
edit
]
After the death of Tourville in 1903 and Demolins in 1907 he assumed leadership of the
Science sociale
group.
He also presided over the École des Roches that Demolins had founded which sought to apply the lessons of social science to educational reform.
From 1908 he held a seat in economic geography at the École libre des sciences politiques.
[22]
De Rousiers gave a course on Large Modern Industries at this school.
[17]
De Rousiers supervised a major inquiry into French manufacturing in 1915-16, co-directed by
Henri Hauser
and
Henri Hitier
, for the National Association of Economic Expansion.
He was one of the main rapporteurs of the major inquiry into the merchant marine by an extra-parliamentary committee from 1922 to 1927.
He published a five-volume work on
Les Grandes Industries modernes
(1924-1928).
He was appointed to the board of the Musée Social.
[23]
Paul de Rousiers died on 28 March 1934.
[1]
His historical monograph on his own family,
Une Famille de hobereaux pendant six siècles
appeared after his death.
[23]
His name was given to the general cargo ship
Paul de Rousiers
, built in 1942 by the Chantiers de Provence in
Port-de-Bouc
.
[17]
Theories
[
edit
]
In
La Vie américaine
Paul de Rousiers distinguished the west, with its ranches, farms and towns that were no more than farm markets, from the east with its manufactures, commerce and city life. He saw them as two successive states of the same society, with the west helping to explain the east.
[5]
De Rousiers, who inspired the revolutionary syndicalist
Georges Sorel
with this work, wrote that the American aristocracy stressed ability and discouraged mediocrity, even among their own children. 
They were much more concerned with helping those with ability than with preventing the incompetent from dying of hunger.
[24]
He wrote that every American feels himself capable of trying his luck on the battlefield of business, so that the general spirit of the country is in complete harmony with that of the millionaires.
[25]
In his 1898
Les Industries monopolisées (trusts) aux Etats-Unis
Paul de Rousiers noted that Americans at the time were too easily persuaded that monopolies must bring large benefits, although the whiskey and rope trusts had been short-lived and the sugar trust depended on protective tariffs and high payments to politicians.
[26]
He thought that the German cartels and American trusts were similar and were designed to avoid lowering prices due to overproduction.
He wrote that when several producers realized their common interests they would inevitably form a highly disciplined association that would defend their interests as long as they followed its instructions.
[27]
He contrasted the German cartel to the American trust, writing,
The former is a league of allies in which each one preserves a certain liberty of action, but forbids himself the usage of certain weapons against the others. It represents a temperament more or less brought out in the economic struggle. On the other hand, the trust is the result of a struggle to the death. One is the German solution, the other the American solution of a problem posed in Germany as in America by the industrial system. ... These two solutions are as different from each other as the economic, social, and political conditions of the German empire are different from the economic, political, and social conditions of the American republic. They are not of the same nature.
[28]
In
La question ouvrière en Angleterre
(1895) de Rousiers describes a process common to all economically advanced societies of constant advances in mechanization, changes in industrial job requirements and changes to markets, and examines how the different branches of industry are affected by the changes, and how the workers react.
[10]
While he was in Britain there was a miners' strike.
In the conclusion of his work he outlines a concept of syndicalism, with organizations independent of workers and owners that would favor the evolution of industry and solve the "labor question".
The way in which the strike was resolved through a conciliation board chaired by a third party seemed to him to foreshadow this new approach.
[11]
In
Les Syndicats industriels de producteurs en France et à l'étranger
(1901) de Rousiers commented favorably on the role of syndicates of manufacturers in regulating the markets, which he saw as beneficial both economically and socially.
[14]
Paul de Rousiers was sympathetic to trade unions but thought they should focus on adapting to the constantly evolving industrial economy.
He saw danger in their participation in political and ideological struggles, and in development of rigid attitudes and approaches.
[11]
These themes were repeated and elaborated in
Le Trade-unionisme en Angleterre
(1896).
[11]
This book led Georges Sorel to emphasise the importance of the unions in his
L'Avenir socialiste des syndicats
(1898).
[25]
In
Hambourg et l'Allemagne contemporaine
(1902) de Rousiers criticized the German labour movement, which he considered poorly organized and influenced too much by social democracy and the class struggle. He also criticized the owners who, by their paternalism, had hindered formation of autonomous trade unions with an élite of workers capable of directing them.

History
[
edit
]
Highway 20 was originally a short, 16 km (10 mi) long highway that ran from Highway 11 in Sylvan Lake to the Highway 12 /
Highway 51
intersection in Bentley. From this intersection, Highway 12 continued north to Rimbey, Breton, and Alsike. In the mid-1980s, when Highway 11 was realigned to bypass Sylvan Lake, Highway 20 was extended 4 km (2 mi) to the south to connect with the new alignment. In January 1988, the 90 km (56 mi) section of Highway 12 between Bentley and Alsike was redesignated as Highway 20, while Highway 51 was decommissioned and redesignated as the new western section of Highway 12.

Baba Nanak Shrine,
a Sikh Gurdwara in
Baghdad
,
Iraq
, which was rediscovered by Sikh soldiers during
World War I
and was repaired and rebuilt during
World War II
, by Sikh soldiers again, existed till 2003 in somewhat good shape.
The founder of the Sikh religion,
Guru Nanak
, who is traditionally locally referred to
Nanak Peer
as in the area,
[1]
came to Baghdad in the early sixteenth century, around 1511 AD
[2]
[3]
after visiting the holy Muslim cities of Mecca and Medina.
[4]
He was initially not allowed to enter the city of Baghdad, which made him spend the night in the cemetery outside the city.  The shrine was originally constructed by the local people in the cemetery area in Guru Nanak's holy memory.
Historical significances
[
edit
]
Main article:
Sikhism in Iraq
The radiance on Guru Nanak's face was reported to be so profound that word spread that a saint had arrived.  Consequently, Guru Nanak ji exchanged spiritual and metaphysical ideas with religious authorities, especially Pir Dastgir and Pir Bahlol, both of whom then became disciples of Guru Nanak and bowed to him. This led to formation of a group of his followers in Baghdad who remembered the Guru as Baba Nanak. There was only loose contact between this place and Sikhs of the Punjab until the First World War when Sikh soldiers rediscovered the shrine.
[5]
Dr. Kirpal Singh, a captain in the Indian Medical Service of the British Indian army during World War I, located this gurudwara in the west of Baghdad town between an old graveyard to the north and the present Baghdad Samara railway line to the south. To the Arabs, this place is well known as the Tomb of Bahlol.  Further, the book titled "Taajudin’s Diary" with foreword by Dr. Harbans Lal, which is an account of a Muslim author who accompanied Guru Nanak from Mecca to Baghdad, explains in detail the conversations Baba Nanak had with Pir Dastgir and Pir Bahlol.
A former Engineer-in-Chief of the Indian army, Major General Harkirat Singh—who was instrumental in the design and construction of the present-day Hemkund gurudwara and the technical and management brain behind it
[6]
—visited Baghdad in 1982, with a mission to encourage the local Sikh community to pitch in to make the Baba Nanak Shrine into a major gurudwara, which task was later undertaken after he died in 1983.  Major General Harkirat Singh was the nephew of Capt. (Dr.) Kirpal Singh and the son of Sardar Sewaram Singh, a Sessions Judge, who wrote the first biography of Guru Nanak in the English Language.  In that book, titled "Divine Master," Sardar Sewaram Singh writes about the Baba Nanak Shrine and the inscription on a stone tablet. In its revised edition, the book gives the layout of the shrine as drawn by Capt. (Dr.) Kirpal Singh.
[7]
Historic relics such as an old plaque with text inscribed in Arabic
[8]
[9]
existed at the Shrine till the
Iraq war
in  2003, but were looted by miscreants after the war.  In 2007, the Iraqi Government expressed a desire to rebuild the shrine. According to a news report, Abu Yusuf was caretaker of the shrine in 2011.
[10]
[11]
Prior to the Iraq war, a few Sikh pilgrims used to visit the shrine. Reports of regular congregations by Indian workers in Iraq, and cooking and sharing langar by them at the shrine are also there.
Present status
[
edit
]
The position till 2018 was that the Gurudwara had been completely damaged. Only parts of an outer wall could be seen next to the Tomb of Bahlol. Only one Mehrab remained in one of the walls. Since 2018, a gate protects the space of the former gurudwara.

There are a multitude of rituals associated with collegiate sporting events across the United States.  Varying by sport, demographics, and location, sporting rituals often become essential to the preparation, organization, and game-day experience.  In fact, many would argue that rituals are the experience.
Ritualization in sports
[
edit
]
Rituals have become an integral part of sporting events in the United States.  Traditionally, before games, students and fans engage in a variety of pregame celebrations including
pep rallies
,
tailgating
, and informal gatherings. This ritual of carousing continues throughout the game into the postgame celebrations. The ritualization of sporting events involves numerous individuals including the fans, players, and crews in charge of maintaining and preparing the fields and stadiums.
The importance of ritual in sporting events cannot be understated.  Fields and stadiums must be properly maintained and prepared before game day.  Fans not only spend hours preparing for game day, often the entire day is dedicated to game day celebrations. Fans even have many pregame rituals that include superstitious activities, such as dressing in certain clothes, making specific foods, and even sitting in particular seats in hopes of their team winning. For many of the players, rituals have become superstitious; however, it is believed that the players don't rely on superstitions to win, but are used in hopes of continuing their winning streaks or good luck.  After all the preparation and game-play, the ritual continues in the form of festivities and celebrations.
Understanding rituals in sport
[
edit
]
The origins of rituals and how and why an individual partakes in traditions vary from person to person. Studies through the use of interviews have identified that individuals may seek to join in traditions as a means to fit in culturally.
[1]
Traditions are often a means of identity, and joining in specific traditions or trends is a way to form a cultural identity that is similar to your surrounding environment. Often individuals join in a particular activity or ritual, such as dressing in team colors or going to rallies, as a result of the influences around them; being family, friends, and the surrounding social environment. Culturally important activities gain the support of the surrounding community and fans. The compiled support for rituals results in an enterprise.
[2]
These rituals become both tradition and business, as many universities and communities make profit off of ritual events (i.e. the trend of going to games and purchasing tickets and team gear). Over time, starting in the 1900s, as varsity team popularity grew, so did the popularity of commercialization, therefore, starting fan support and traditions.
Various sport rituals
[
edit
]
Every sport maintains different rituals. Occurrences of rituals in every sport will typically be carried out over pre-game, game-play, and post-game rituals.  While there are specific rituals associated with many teams, the organization of game play often determines the type of rituals that take place.  Rituals will often find comfortable homes in the time between game-play.  Whether the game is divided into rounds, quarters, innings or another form of time keepings, the time between is filled with either a performance by cheer groups, the band, or other organizations, or participation from within the crowd in attendance through body movements, chants, or cheers.  However, rituals are not isolated to the time between game-play, and silences, cheering, or intimidation and taunting can become part of the experience.  Many sport participants and observers would be left with a feeling of absence if they didn't occur.  Many passionate sport observers feel that the outcomes of particular games are of the most importance in their lives, and will conduct rituals in an attempt to increase the chance that their wishes come true. The rituals vary although their importance to those involved remains consistent.
Members of
Alpha Phi Omega
carry the
world's largest Texas flag
during a pregame ceremony at a University of Texas football game. Another notable flag-related tradition is that of
Washington State University
; a group of alumni has arranged for a school flag to be flown at every broadcast of the football version of
College GameDay
since October 2003.
Ritual in rivalry
[
edit
]
Ritual is often in the history and rivalry between schools. Ritual surrounds major sporting events between universities that have a profound sense of competition amongst each other. From the trophies and bragging rights awarded to winning teams, to the hype and tradition centering on the game itself, many university teams and communities take part in the rituals surrounding rivalry games. One such example that has been prominent since 1900 is the rivalry between the
University of Texas
and the
University of Oklahoma
rivalry. Also known as the
Red River Rivalry
and Show Down, members of the teams and communities fight for both conference standing and national titles, but most importantly bragging rights.
[3]
Played on a neutral field, the Longhorns and Sooners duke it out for the claim of the Red River for the year.
[4]
One example of similar intensity is the
Iron Bowl
, the football rivalry between the
University of Alabama
and
Auburn University
. These teams play for a trophy, but more importantly ownership and bragging rights of the state.
[4]
A further example of ritual within rivalry is the passing of the
Old Oaken Bucket
between the football teams of
Indiana University
and
Purdue University
. These two teams have been exchanging this 100-year-old bucket for the past 76 years. Crowned with a paired I-P from the first game resulting in a tie, each year, the winning team adds a "P" or an "I" link to the chain of the bucket, growing by victories.
[5]
Finally, said to be "filled with the spirits of gridiron men," the
Little Brown Jug
represents a steadfast football battle between the Universities of
Michigan
and
Minnesota
. This Little Brown Jug marked with a large "M" after a tie between the two teams in 1903 when the game was called two minutes because the storming of the field by fans has been the winning prize between the two rival teams. Painted, hidden, and returned to the winning team post victory, the jug has much history among the teams as the excitement and ritualistic passing of the jug is prominent.
[6]
Ritual in school songs, cheers, and chants
[
edit
]
Colleges and universities around the country, both big and small, are often represented by a fight song or chant. This ritualistic activity is seen from coast to coast as students, athletes, and fans join in unison chanting and singing in support of their school. These songs, which often date to the early 20th century, are means to identify with a team and show support. Often played at the start of games, in response to game occurrences, and after wins, these songs and chants are ritual to bringing unison among supporters and engaging fans’ teams. For example, the
University of Southern California
fight song "
Fight On
" was written in 1922 as a part of a spirit competition and now is sung at sporting events to cheer on USC teams.
[7]
Texas A&M University
has a series of chants, yells, and songs, along with a traditional fight song the University members identify with.
[8]
These are led by
Yell Leaders
rather than cheerleaders in order to "intensify the crowd" at games and events.
[9]
Texas A&M's chants are even used to rally up students before game day at events such as
Midnight Yell Practice
, which began to take its roots in the early 1900s, as yell leaders direct the ritual chants and old army cheers.
[10]
The
Notre Dame Victory March
is also a prominent example of tradition and ritual in unified support for a school through song and chant. Written in 1908, this song has stood the test of time as once trying to be rewritten by a different composer latter in the century. The refusal to promote and change songs shows dedication to the original, traditional fight song, which is played at
Notre Dame
events.
[11]
Michigan State University's fight song was written in response to the rise in rivalry between university sports teams and served as a way to rally supports. The song was written by the yellmaster, Irving Lankey, as a way to further support for the football team and provide enthusiasm that stretched beyond the traditional band music available.
[12]
One last example, The University of Oklahoma, has a fight song that dates back to 1905. The traditional song
Boomer Sooner
was written in order to raise crowd enthusiasm at football games and is still to this day sang as part of a team supporting and crowd involvement ritual.
[13]
These songs and chants that are found at universities across the United States often have familiar tunes to them, because as the songs were written in the early 1900s, writers would often use songs previously used by other schools or already in existence as the basis for a fight song, such as the case with OU, using Yale's song but changing the words.
[13]
Pep rallies and ceremonies as ritual
[
edit
]
Some of the very distinct aspects of pre-game rituals are the pep rallies that occur at schools across the country. Although pep rallies occur during lower levels of schooling, collegiate pep rallies tend to be much larger, especially before big games. One example of such a heated ceremony is the
Texas A&M Bonfire
, which traditionally occurred prior to
that school's
annual matchup against the
University of Texas
in November.
[14]
This event sparked a good deal of controversy within the A&M community after 12 students were killed during a collapse in 1999.
[15]
The event has since moved off campus and has remained unaffiliated with the University for the past 10 years. It is also important to note that the A&M community glorifies the fallen Aggies with a memorial and most recently a DVD, which can be purchased on campus.
[16]
A portion of the proceeds goes to the Bonfire Remembrance Fund.
[17]
Auburn University
has a tradition called the
"Tiger Walk"
, which began in the 1960s.
[18]
Prior to each home game, fans line Donahue Drive and cheer on the athletes as they walk from the athletes' dorm into the stadium for the game. The University of Texas students and fans also participated in a rally called the A&M Hex Rally, which was put on by the Texas Exes organization,
[19]
before the UT-A&M rivalry ended for the time being with A&M's
2012 move
to the
Southeastern Conference
. This ritualistic gathering, chanting, and cheering of Longhorn fans began as an attempt to break a winning streak of Texas A&M on the
Aggies' home field
.
Group behaviors
[
edit
]
Many universities also have traditions that dictate group behavior before, during, and after the football games. For example, many schools create "dress codes" for specific games each season. Penn State and Texas A&M host "white-outs" and "maroon-outs" during which the fans in the stands are expected to wear a specific color to create a sense of unity.
[20]
[21]
Group behaviors aren't exclusive to the fans however. Players for the University of Notre Dame have a tradition of slapping a sign that reads "Play Like a Champion Today" as they leave the locker room and take the field.
[22]
This tradition has been mimicked at other schools across the country.
[23]
Although not originally associated with the United States, one of the most iconic group behaviors in world sports—the
haka
of the
New Zealand national rugby union team
(the All Blacks)—has been appropriated by a few American college and high school teams, generally those with a significant
Polynesian
influence. (The Polynesian connection stems from the origin of New Zealand's indigenous
Māori people
, creators of the haka.) Most notably, the
University of Hawaiʻi football team
performed the All Blacks' haka as part of its pregame ritual before adopting its own dance, the haʻa, based on Native Hawaiian traditions.
[24]
It is not uncommon to see individuals showing hand gestures and signals at sporting events or within a university environment. For example, Texas Tech fans are known for their "Guns Up" hand gesture that resembles the shape of an L made by the thumb and forefinger. This began in 1972 and has traditionally represented the Tech Raiders shooting their opponents down and is often used in celebration at games.
[25]
The popularity has grown among Baylor students of the saying "Sic 'Em Bears" with the hand gesture that resembles a bear claw. The cheer with the corresponding gesture is often seen as students cheer together for Baylor teams during competition.
[26]
Preparations/dress
[
edit
]
In addition to the above-mentioned designated dress days, most fans tend to wear one of their team's primary colors to a game. This sort of dress, which is not unlike wearing "Sunday's Best" to Church, seems to assist in building commentary between fans and the team. Additionally, observations of the sidelines show that some coaches wear specific colors based on their duties on the field. In one photo of a Nebraska coach, we can see that he is wearing a less traditional color, probably so the players can identify him from the field easily when looking for the play call.

Neviusia cliftonii
is a rare species of
shrub
in the
rose family
which is known by the common name
Shasta snow-wreath
. It is
endemic
to
Shasta County, California
, where it is known from about 25 occurrences in the mountains around
Lake Shasta
.
[2]
The shrub was not known to science until 1992, when it was discovered east of
Redding, California
and described as a new species in
Neviusia
, previously a monotypic genus.
[3]
Description
[
edit
]
Neviusia cliftonii
is an erect
deciduous
shrub reaching 2.5 meters (8 ft 2 in) in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are oval or heart-shaped and lined with toothed lobes. The leaf blades reach 6 centimeters (2.4 in) long and are borne on short
petioles
. The
inflorescence
is an
umbel-like
cluster of 3 to 5 flowers. The flower is a ball of about 50 long, whiskery white
stamens
each about 0.5 centimeters (0.20 in) long. There are rarely a single white petal basal to the stamens, although the petals are often absent. The fruit type is a soft-bodied
achene
a few millimeters long [anatomically the fruit is an achenetum].
When not in flower, the plant resembles common shrubs such as
oceanspray
and
ninebark
, one reason why it may have gone unrecognized for so long.

Series of military actions by the Union Army
The
Mississippi River campaigns
, within the
Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War
, were a series of military actions by the
Union Army
during which Union troops, helped by
Union Navy
gunboats
and
river ironclads
, took control of the
Cumberland River
, the
Tennessee River
, and the
Mississippi River
, a main north-south avenue of transport.
The campaign on and along the Mississippi River started in February 1862 with Union forces pushing down from
Cairo, Illinois
into disputed territory in Missouri and Kentucky and
Confederate
territory in Tennessee.  It ended with the surrender of the last Confederate strongholds on the Mississippi River,
Vicksburg, Mississippi
on July 4, 1863 and of
Port Hudson, Louisiana
on July 9, 1863.  Flag Officer Foote initially commanded the Union naval forces, which were later led by Farragut and Porter.
Background
[
edit
]
In July 1863, the
Trans-Mississippi Department
of the
Confederate States of America
was split from the Confederate States east of the river when the Union gained control of the entire Mississippi River.  This cut the main east-west artery of transportation for the South, depriving the rest of the Confederacy of men, food and other supplies from the Confederate States west of the river.  While not commonly lumped together under this designation, the river campaigns were undertaken mainly for reasons found in Union
General-in-Chief
Winfield Scott's
1861
Anaconda Plan
.  Scott proposed to defeat the Confederacy largely through blockade of ports and control of rivers leading to the economic 'strangulation' of the Confederacy, which he hoped would prevent a large number of bloody land battles.
The original Union Army expedition to control the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers was under the overall command
Major General
Henry W. Halleck
although
Brigadier General
Ulysses S. Grant
commanded the forces in the field.
Flag officer
Andrew H. Foote
commanded the Navy's squadrons. The Vicksburg and Port Hudson campaigns were commanded by Major Generals Grant and
Nathaniel P. Banks
, respectively while the
Mississippi River Squadron
was commanded by then
Rear Admiral
David Farragut
from the south and Flag Officer
David Dixon Porter
from the north.

Island Number Ten
Practical elements of warfare on the Mississippi
[
edit
]
Although an important role in the Mississippi River campaign was played by armored
paddle steamers
, the campaign was a Union Army undertaking, as the ships used were under Army command and were used as army transports and floating gun stations rather than independent warships.  Most of their boats were either converted paddle steamers or purpose-built gunboats that had never seen the sea. Because of this, the
Mississippi River Squadron
quickly became known as the
Brown-water navy
. This was a reference to the brown, muddy water of the Mississippi, as compared to the deep blue commonly associated with the sea. The only exception was at the
Siege of Vicksburg
where the army, marching downstream met up with the Union Navy under Rear Admiral David Farragut sailing upstream and the two combined their forces for an all-out land-and-sea shelling of the town.
The river campaigns saw the first practical use of river gunboats and river ironclads, in particular the
City-class ironclads
, ironclad paddle steamers built by
James B. Eads
in
St. Louis
and
Cairo, Illinois
. It also saw the use of
sea mines
, which at that time were called
torpedoes
, a term applied to self-propelled warheads only later,
torpedo rams
and a brief
Confederate
experiment in deploying a
casemate ironclad
, the
CSS Arkansas
, in a river defense role.
Notable engagements
[
edit
]
Important battles in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers campaign were the capture of
Fort Henry
and
Fort Donelson
, where the Union forces were under the direct command of
Brigadier General
U.S. Grant, who reported to Major General Halleck, and the naval forces of the Western Gunboat Flotilla, predecessor of the Mississippi River Squadron, were led by Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote. Key military actions along the Mississippi River included the
Island No. 10
, the
Battle of Memphis
,
Siege of Vicksburg

Bertram Barney Wainer
(30 December 1928 - 16 January 1987) was an Australian doctor who successfully campaigned for legal access to
abortion
for women in the state of
Victoria
. In the process he received multiple death threats from
Victoria Police
and survived at least three attempts on his life, including shootings and arson. He was also to uncover political and police corruption.
Biography
[
edit
]
Born in
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
(his father had died before his birth),
[1]
he left school at thirteen and migrated to Australia eight years later with 2s 6d in his pocket. He did many odd jobs while attending night school and later the
University of Melbourne
, where he obtained his medical degree in 1958.
He became an army doctor in 1960 but resigned in 1966 as commander of a military hospital to go into private practice in
St Kilda
, Melbourne.
In 1967 a young woman came to Wainer's Melbourne surgery seeking emergency treatment after a back-yard abortion. For Wainer it marked the beginning of a long struggle to overturn laws that made abortion an offence punishable by up to fifteen years in jail.
The campaign of Wainer and others came to a head in 1969.  Dr. Ken Davidson had been charged under the existing abortion law.   After police began questioning women from patient files seized in a raid on the
doctor's surgery
, on 20 May 1969, Wainer placed an advertisement in the mass circulation
The Sun News-Pictorial
; under the heading 'Abortion Abortion Abortion' the ad called on women  "not be intimidated by bullying or intimidatory tactics [of the police]".
On 3 June 1969, in a landmark decision
R v Davidson
, Dr. Davidson was acquitted; the court decision said, in part, that abortion could be legal under the following conditions: it was "(a) necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or her physical or mental health which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail; and (b) in circumstances not out of proportion to the danger to be averted".
[2]
[3]
[4]
A few weeks after this Wainer surrendered himself to police and "confessed" to performing an abortion, thus testing the new legal framework and bringing publicity to the decision in the Davidson case.  (Before that time Wainer had not performed abortions; this was one of the reasons he could be such a prominent advocate for change since he had not committed a 'crime').  Soon after this all the doctors charged with performing abortions were acquitted or proceedings were dropped.
[5]
Wainer also raised allegations of police corruption in protecting back-yard abortion rackets. His claims were published in stories written by journalist
Evan Whitton
in Melbourne's
Truth
newspaper. On 9 December 1969 a series of affidavits was handed to the Solicitor-General, Basil Murray QC. They alleged that police were protecting doctors as well as back-yard abortionists, including Charles Wyatt, a former Victorian police officer.
[6]
During the six months Wainer had been campaigning, Jack Ford had been promoted to the head of the Homicide squad. An inquiry which commenced in early 1970 headed by William Kaye QC revealed an institutionalised and systematic graft dating back to about 1953, and resulted in Ford and another Superintendent, Jack Matthews, being jailed for five years. Martin Jacobsen, a constable, was jailed for three years.
[7]
[8]
Wainer opened the Fertility Control Clinic in
East Melbourne
in 1972: the first in Australia where public access to abortion could be obtained with no upfront fees.
[9]
He wrote a book about his experiences, "It Isn't Nice", that was published in 1972.
[10]
In October 1974, Wainer presented the solicitor-general with a secretly-made tape recording of a senior sergeant talking to a minor criminal. He alleged that the conversation indicated that the policeman had accepted a bribe. After some initial inquiries has been made, the Hamer government set up an inquiry headed by Barry Beach, QC. It found that the health of the force was "not well". However, only 33 of the 55 police named by Beach were charged and all of them were acquitted.
[11]
[8]
[12]
In 1975, Wainer was interviewed on ABC TV's
The
Norman Gunston
Show
.
He ran for the seat of
Casey
in the
1980 election
, achieving 3.97% of the vote.
He died of a heart attack in 1987 at
Ararat, Victoria
.
[13]

Wainer's life has been the subject of a documentary,

Highway system in Cuba
The
Carretera Central
through
Santa Clara
Vía Blanca
at the bridge of
Bacunayagua
Map showing the Cuban motorway network
The
road network of
Cuba
consists of 60,858 km (37,815 mi) of roads, of which over  29,850 km (18,550 mi) are
paved
and 31,038 km (19,286 mi) are unpaved. The Caribbean country counts also 654 km (406 mi) of
motorways
(
autopistas
).
Motorways
[
edit
]
Overview
[
edit
]
Cuba has eight toll-free expressways named
Autopistas
, seven of them centralized in the city of
Havana
and connected to each other by the Havana Ring Road, with the exception of the motorway to
Mariel
. The carriageway is
divided
and the lanes in each direction go from two to four. Maximum speed limit is 120 km/h (75 mph). In the
Isla de la Juventud
, the
dual carriageway
from
Nueva Gerona
to
La Fe
is classified as a motorway.
[1]
The principal motorways A1 and A4, running from the west to the east of the island and partly unbuilt (most of A1 sections), are the only one numbered and shortened with "A".
[1]
As well as the
Carretera Central
covers the entire island, they are projected to perform the same function as motorways.
The route from
Matanzas
to
Varadero
of the
Vía Blanca
is the only
toll road
between Cuban motorways. The other
autopistas
have short routes and run from Havana to its suburban towns in
Artemisa
and
Mayabeque
provinces.

Harley Quinn
(
Harleen Quinzel
) is a
character
appearing in
American comic books
produced by
DC Comics
. She was created by
Paul Dini
and
Bruce Timm
for
Batman: The Animated Series
as a
henchwoman
for the
supervillain
Joker
, debuting in its 8th episode, "
Joker's Favor
", on September 11, 1992. While intended to appear in one episode, Quinn became a recurring character within the
DC Animated Universe
(DCAU) as the Joker's sidekick and love interest, and was adapted into
DC Comics
'
canon
seven years later, beginning with the
one-shot
Batman: Harley Quinn
#1 (October 1999). Quinn's
origin story
features her as a former
psychologist
at
Gotham City
's
Arkham Asylum
who was manipulated by and fell in love with the Joker, her patient, eventually becoming his accomplice and lover. The character's alias is a
play
on the
stock character
Harlequin
from the 16th-century
Italian theater
commedia dell'arte
.
Following her introduction to the comics in 1999, Harley Quinn was depicted as the sidekick and lover of the Joker as well as the criminal associate and best friend of fellow supervillain
Poison Ivy
. Later stories depicted Quinn as a supervillain who has left her abusive and
codependent
relationship with the Joker behind, beginning with the publication of her
ongoing series
,
Harley Quinn
, in which her independence was established by
Karl Kesel
in 2000. After years of scarce appearances in comics, Quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the
Gotham City Sirens
series, as part of an unstable alliance with Poison Ivy and
Catwoman
. In 2011, DC's line-wide
reboot
The New 52
reintroduced Quinn in the relaunched
Suicide Squad
title, which changed the character's personality, design, and origin, replacing her original jester costume with a revealing ensemble and depicting her to be darker than her earlier counterpart. The character took a lighthearted and humorous direction with her second ongoing series in 2013, written by
Amanda Conner
and
Jimmy Palmiotti
, which features the character moving to her hometown of
Brooklyn
and starting her own life in
Coney Island
. The character has since been depicted as an
antihero
independent of the Joker and a recurring core member of the Suicide Squad, with Poison Ivy becoming her primary romantic interest.
[5]
In 2021, DC's line-wide
Infinite Frontier
relaunch brought Quinn back to
Gotham City
and reestablished her as a
superhero
seeking redemption for her past actions.
Harley Quinn's abilities include
expert
gymnastic
skills, proficiency in weapons and hand-to-hand combat, complete unpredictability, immunity to toxins, and enhanced strength, agility, and durability. Quinn often wields
clown-themed
gag weapons, with an oversized
mallet
being her signature weapon. Additionally, she has a pair of pet
hyenas
,
Bud and Lou
, which sometimes serve as her
attack dogs
, and as a trained psychologist with a genius-level intellect, she is adept at deception and psychological manipulation.
Harley Quinn has become one of DC Comics' most popular and profitable characters and has been featured in many of DC's comic books and adapted in various other media and merchandise. DC Comics Publisher
Jim Lee
considers Harley Quinn the fourth pillar of DC Comics' publishing line, behind
Superman
,
Batman
, and
Wonder Woman
.
Originally voiced by
Arleen Sorkin
in the
DC Animated Universe
, she has since appeared in many other DC projects voiced by actresses such as
Tara Strong
,
Hynden Walch
,
Laura Bailey
,
Jenny Slate
,
Melissa Rauch
,
Laura Post
, and
Kaley Cuoco
; the latter provided the character's voice in the 2019 animated series
Harley Quinn
.
Mia Sara
portrayed the character in the 2002 television series
Birds of Prey
.
Harley Quinn
makes her live-action cinematic debut in the
DC Extended Universe
(DCEU) film
Suicide Squad
(2016), where she is portrayed by
Margot Robbie
. Robbie reprises her role in
Birds of Prey
(2020) and
The Suicide Squad
(2021), with elements of her portrayal's design consequentially incorporated into comics, while
Lady Gaga
will portray the character in
Joker: Folie à Deux
(2024).

Creation and development
[

Harley Quinn as she appears in the
DC Animated Universe
, art by
Bruce Timm
.
Harley Quinn was created by
Paul Dini
and
Bruce Timm
for the 1992
Batman: The Animated Series
episode entitled "
Joker's Favor
" while Dini was writing the episode.
[6]
Initially written as an animated equivalent of a
walk-on role
, Harley Quinn was intended to appear in just one episode.
[7]
[8]
As Dini was putting together the story for the episode, he wanted to introduce a
foil
for the supervillain the Joker that would emphasize the Joker's comic book personality traits: funny, scary, and egotistical.
[9]
[10]
He then thought of giving Joker a henchwoman, inspired by the
molls
of the
1960s live-action
Batman
series
,
[8]
[11]
[12]
and then decided she would be a "funny counterpart to the Joker to maybe work up a little
Punch and Judy
attitude between them";
[9]
Dini stated, "[...] she could crack a joke and the henchmen would laugh, and the Joker would kind of glare at her".
[13]
In 1991, after seeing his college friend
Arleen Sorkin
play a
jester
in a
dream sequence
in the
soap opera
Days of Our Lives
, Dini decided to have Sorkin voice her.
[9]
[12]
Dini then based Harley Quinn on Sorkin, incorporating aspects such as her mannerisms and "very snappy, wisecracking, bubbly blonde" personality.
[13]
[10]
[9]
In recording Harley Quinn's voice, Sorkin spoke in her normal
New York accent
while putting in a "little
Yiddish
sound", since Dini made the character
Jewish
, another aspect of the character borrowed from Sorkin;
[12]
[14]
[15]
[16]
Dini described her voice for the character as having "a snappy blonde but also kind of a bad girl": "a little bit of Adelaide from
Guys and Dolls
, a little bit of
Judy Holliday
", and "a lot of Arleen", stating that it sounded "very close" to Sorkin's voice.

Video
, which served as inspiration for the character's creation. Dini came across the scene while watching a
VHS tape
of Sorkin's "favorite
Days
moments", which he had received from her.
[9]
[12]
Dini had several names in mind while naming the character, such as
Columbine
, and eventually settled on the name "Harley Quinn".
[19]
Dini chose the name for the character to be in line with other Batman characters's names being
puns
, and also because he thought "Harley was a fun name for a girl".
[17]
[13]
The name Harley Quinn is a
play
on
Harlequin
, a
stock character
from the
sixteenth-century
Italian physical comedy
theater
commedia dell'arte
.
[8]
[20]
In designing the character, Timm did a "simplified supervillain version" of traditional Harlequin gear; from the
commedia dell'arte
original, he took the
jester hat
,
ruffled
collar, diamond pattern, and domino mask and put them on a red-and-black
bodysuit
, on which the diamonds were strategically placed for easier animation.
[8]
[15]
Timm took Harley Quinn's red and black color scheme from the
Golden Age
comic book character
Daredevil
.
[8]
Dini had previously made a rough design for the character, which Timm improved on.
[12]
Expanded role
[
edit
]
"Eventually each of the directors wanted to do a Harley episode, so the character began to appear in stories without the Joker. Over the years she allied herself with best gal pal Poison Ivy for occasional romps through Gotham and has even succeeded in giving Batman a hard time on her own. We now look upon Harley as our series' wild card, capable of showing up anytime to bedevil our heroes with her screwball antics".
Paul Dini
[10]
After seeing Harley Quinn in the
rough cut
of "Joker's Favor", the producers of
Batman: The Animated Series
, which include Dini and Timm, were impressed with the result, with Dini wanting to bring the character back for more episodes.
[21]
[8]
Timm and another producer,
Alan Burnett
, were initially reluctant of this and thought that giving Joker a girlfriend "played more towards his comedic side" and would "humanize him too much", which contrasted their vision for Joker as a character who is "as serious a threat as possible to Batman".
[21]
[8]
Nevertheless, months after "Joker's Favor", Harley made a second appearance on the show in the episode "The Laughing Fish" and became the Joker's love interest.
[8]
Harley Quinn gained popularity with fans of
The Animated Series
, with the character being featured more on the show and eventually starring in her own episodes, such as 1993's "Harley and Ivy", which introduced a friendship between her and fellow supervillain
Poison Ivy
, and 1994's "Harlequinade" and "Harley's Holiday", which explored her life without the Joker.
[22]
[23]
[24]
Harley Quinn then became a
recurring character
in the
DC Animated Universe
, appearing in
The Animated Series
sequel
The New Batman Adventures
, the direct-to-video film
Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker
, and in non-Batman animation such as
Superman: The Animated Series
,
Static Shock
, and
Justice League
. In February 1994, she made her first appearance in a video game in
The Adventures of Batman and Robin
, an
action platformer
based on
Batman: The Animated Series
.

Suicide Squad
.
[27]
[21]
[28]
[29]
[30]
[31]
Because of her popularity, Harley Quinn was adapted into DC's comic books.
[32]
In September 1993, a year following Harley Quinn's first appearance in
Batman: The Animated Series
, the character made her comic book debut in the 12th issue of
The Batman Adventures
, a series set in the universe of
The Animated Series
, and became a regular character.
[5]
[6]
In 1997, she appeared in the story
Batman: Thrillkiller
, released under
Elseworlds
, a DC Comics
imprint
that published out-of-continuity alternate reality stories, as
Hayley Fitzpatrick

[5]
In 1999, she became a canonical character with the release of
Batman: Harley Quinn

Origin story
[
edit
]
Main article:
The Batman Adventures: Mad Love
"Bruce and I [...] were talking about what if there was some sort of surprise to her origin? What if she's not just a hench girl? We came up with the idea that she had been a doctor at Arkham Asylum and the Joker had gotten into her head and worked her into being his follower. ...Then we thought, what if Harley's in the role of the long-suffering girlfriend?"
Paul Dini about the creation of
Mad Love
[13]
In February 1994, the
one-shot
The Batman Adventures: Mad Love
recounting Harley's
origin
was released. Written by Dini and drawn by Timm, the story marks their first comic book collaboration.
[21]
Mad Love
introduces Harley Quinn as a former
psychologist
named Harleen Quinzel who fell in love with the Joker during her
internship
at
Gotham City's
Arkham Asylum
and details her transformation into the Joker's villainous accomplice Harley Quinn, as well as the Joker's lack of respect for Harley.
[21]
[23]
[33]
[34]
Widely considered the definitive Harley Quinn story,
[35]
[36]
[37]
Mad Love
added dimensions to the character, with Dini introducing Harley Quinn's motivations as well as establishing her as a tragic and sympathetic figure.
[38]
[39]
[40]
[41]
[42]
The story received wide praise and won the
Eisner
and
Harvey
awards for Best Single Issue in the same year and was later adapted into an episode of the same name in
The New Batman Adventures
in 1999.
[43]
[44]
[24]
Name origin
[
edit
]
Mad Love
establishes Harley Quinn's full name to be Harleen Frances Quinzel. "Harleen Frances" was taken from Sorkin's first and middle name, Arleen Frances, while "Quinzel" came from one of Dini's former
Emerson College
instructors, who was surnamed Quenzel.
[13]
Introduction to mainstream DC continuity
[
edit
]
Harley Quinn was adapted into the mainstream
DC Universe
with the 1999 one-shot graphic novel
Batman: Harley Quinn
, written by Dini and illustrated by Yvel Guichet,
[45]
which put her origin in the middle of the
Batman: No Man's Land
story line.
[46]
Dini changed Harley and the Joker's relationship to be darker to match the Joker's character in the comics; in the story, the Joker attempts to kill Harley at the first opportunity. Harley's immunity to toxins and enhanced strength and agility, which were gained from a special formula created by Poison Ivy, were carried over from
Batman: The Animated Series
, with Dini stating that they would give her a sort of "physical edge" over Batman and other heroes.
[21]
[45]
First ongoing series
[
edit
]
"[The series] is an interesting assignment because the main character is a) insane and b) a criminal, and both of these things are pretty essential to the character, so we don't want to get rid of either of them. [...] [We] hammered out a direction for the book which [...] will establish a motivation and agenda for Harley. Depending on the storyline, she will be on the side of the angels sometimes, and on the side of the demons and devils on others. Like most great crime characters, she's not concerned with the law. What concerns her is something totally different. What that is will be revealed as the first half dozen issues progress".
Karl Kesel, 2000
[47]
While pursuing new assignments at DC Comics' offices in
New York City
,
Karl Kesel
was approached by former DC editor Matt Idelson to create a pitch for Harley Quinn's first
ongoing series
, which Kesel accepted, being a fan of the character after having read
Mad Love
.
[21]
Kesel chose
Terry Dodson
as the artist for the series, whose art Kesel thought complemented the character's cartoonish roots and worldview.
[21]
[48]
Kesel called Dodson and asked him if he was interested on working on the comic, to which Dodson agreed, and the two worked for a month on their proposal for the series, which was to make a comic about "love gone horribly, terribly wrong".
[48]
[21]
The proposal was accepted by DC Comics, and the pair began work on the series, with Kesel and Dodson both being involved in the storytelling, and Dodson bringing in his wife,
Rachel Dodson
, to ink.
[21]
Kesel's run on the series began being published in December 2000, and was about Harley Quinn leaving the Joker and becoming a solo criminal, alongside a supporting cast of henchmen named the Quinntets.
[21]
Because of underwhelming sales, his 25-issue run ended in December 2002, and DC decided to change the creative team; the series was given to writer A.J. Lieberman and artists
Mike Huddleston
and
Troy Nixey
by Idelson, and took on a grittier and darker direction, contrasting Kesel's run.
[49]
The decision renewed interest in the character, but the sales remained lackluster and the series was cancelled in 2003.
[49]
[12]
Gotham City Sirens
[

Main article:
Gotham City Sirens
After years of scarce appearances in comics, Harley Quinn resurfaced in a leading role in July 2009 with
Gotham City Sirens
, a team-up title created by Dini.
[50]
[5]
[12]
The series brought together Batman's most popular female villains, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy, in an unstable alliance.
[51]
[52]
[53]
The series also expanded on Harley Quinn's background and early life; in
Gotham City Sirens
#7, Dini established the character's hometown being
Brooklyn
, based on her accent and also introduced her dysfunctional family, with her swindling father being described as the main reason for her pursuing
psychology
.
[54]
[55]
[56]
The first several issues of
Gotham City Sirens
were written by Dini and illustrated by Guillem March. Other creatives who worked for the series include writers
Tony Bedard
and Peter Calloway, and artists
David López
, Andres Guinaldo, Peter Nguyen, Jeremy Haun, and Ramon Bachs.
[52]
The series was cancelled in August 2011 for
The New 52
, DC Comics' relaunch of their entire comic line.

The New 52

Suicide Squad
[
edit
]
"One thing that we're trying to show with her, and I don't think it gets played with enough with Harley, is here's a woman who was a very intelligent and very manipulative doctor. We're trying to play up that quality. She is crazy, but there is something behind the madness. In the new DCU maybe everyone doesn't get shipped off to Arkham Asylum. Some people may have to do hard time and get shipped off to Belle Reve [the prison the Suicide Squad operates out of], and her presence here doesn't mean she hasn't been or won't end up in Arkham. Basically, we needed a bad girl character, and the best bad girl character in the DCU is Harley Quinn".
Adam Glass, 2011
[57]
As part of the
New 52
reboot
in September 2011, Harley Quinn was reintroduced by
Adam Glass
as a prominent member of the supervillain team Task Force X in the relaunched
Suicide Squad
series.
[23]
[58]
The character was heavily redesigned to fit the tone of the book, and was inspired by Harley's designs in the video games
Batman: Arkham Asylum
and
Batman: Arkham City
;
[59]
[60]
her color motif was changed to red and blue, her jester costume was replaced with a revealing ensemble consisting of a
corset
and
hot pants
, her skin was bleached white, and her previously blonde hair was altered to half-blue and half-red.
[60]
[12]
[58]
[61]
Her personality had also been depicted to be more violent and psychopathic than her former iteration.

San Diego Comic Con

art by Ryan Benjamin.
In the series, Glass separated Harley Quinn from the Joker and explored her "becom[ing] her own person", with the Suicide Squad becoming a family to her;
[63]
[64]
Glass said: "Harley's always wanted to belong to something. And if not Joker, then the team - and she's finding herself in all this. She's finding her place in the world, that she's not just a sidekick".
[64]
Suicide Squad
was canceled in April 2014 to coincide with the conclusion of the "
Forever Evil
" storyline.
[65]
New origin
[
edit
]
In the seventh issue of
Suicide Squad
, Glass revised Harley Quinn's origin story, making it reflect the Joker's origins. In the story, the Joker takes Harleen Quinzel to the
chemical plant
where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will, which bleaches her skin and drives her insane, resulting in her transformation to Harley Quinn.
[66]
This origin was received negatively by fans, who felt that its removal of Harley Quinn's choice to become the Joker's accomplice willingly, as depicted in her previous origin stories, took out an essential part of her character.
[66]
Second ongoing series
[
edit
]
Textless cover art of the second series' first issue featuring Harley Quinn's roller derby-inspired costume, art by Amanda Conner and
Paul Mounts
. Harley Quinn co-creator Bruce Timm said of the design: "I really like Amanda's design a lot because it's modern and a little bit punk rock, but it's really fun without being trashy. I think the whole roller-derby look is really fun because it's tough but it's still playful. It's not...It's not skanky".
[21]
Harley Quinn's second ongoing series, written by husband and wife
Jimmy Palmiotti
and
Amanda Conner
, with the interior art illustrated by Chad Hardin and John Timms, explored Harley Quinn leaving Gotham City and starting her own life in her hometown of Brooklyn, depicting her as a
landlord
in
Coney Island
, where she shares an
apartment building
with a supporting cast of "
sideshow
freaks".
[67]
[12]
[68]
[69]
[70]
Considered to be the most defining writers to work on the character since Dini and Timm, Palmiotti and Conner reinvented Harley Quinn as an antihero who has left her controlling relationship with the Joker behind.
[23]
[71]
[72]
In contrast to Harley Quinn's depiction in Glass'
Suicide Squad
, Palmiotti and Conner wrote Harley Quinn with a lighthearted, cartoonish, and humorous tone. Her costume has also been changed with a
roller derby
-inspired costume designed by Conner, which incorporates Conner's favorite aspects of Harley Quinn's early costume and her costume in Glass' run of
Suicide Squad
.
[69]
[73]
[67]
The series also brought back Harley Quinn's red and black motif.
[61]
The series began being published in November 2013, starting with
Harley Quinn
#0, which brought together 17 comic book artists, including Harley Quinn co-creator Bruce Timm, to illustrate a
fourth wall
-breaking story about Harley thinking of the artists that could illustrate her in her own comic book series.
[74]
[75]
The rest of the series details Harley Quinn's adventures in Coney Island with her supporting cast.
[76]
In
Harley Quinn
#25, Palmiotti and Conner reunited Harley Quinn with the Joker; the story depicts Harley Quinn returning to Gotham City to confront the Joker and end their relationship.
[77]
[78]
With Harley Quinn's longtime friend Poison Ivy being a recurring character in the series, Palmiotti and Conner built on their relationship and hinted at romantic feelings between the two characters; Poison Ivy is shown kissing Harley Quinn multiple times throughout the series, and a
sexual relationship
between them was alluded to in issue #25.
[76]
[72]
When asked regarding their relationship in a Twitter Q&A, Palmiotti and Conner replied: "Yes, they are girlfriends without the jealousy of
monogamy
".
[34]
The
New 52
Harley Quinn
series received positive reception, and was also one of DC Comics' top-selling series, inspiring multiple
spin-offs
.
[76]
[73]
The series was ended for the
DC Rebirth
relaunch of DC's titles.
[79]
Controversies
[
edit
]
The cover of the first issue of the
New 52
'
s
Suicide Squad
title drew controversy for its sexual depiction of Harley Quinn.
[12]
This also caused some fans of the character to send Glass
hate mail
and personal threats.
[63]
In September 2013, DC Comics announced an art contest entitled "Break into comics with Harley Quinn!", in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to
National Suicide Prevention Week
, but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley Quinn in the fourth scenario, in which the character attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. The
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention
,
American Psychiatric Association
, and
National Alliance on Mental Illness
all responded to the controversy in an emailed group statement to the
Huffington Post
: "We are disappointed that DC Comics has decided to host a contest looking for artists to develop ways to depict suicide attempts by one of its main villains - Harley Quinn". After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC Comics apologized, saying they should have made it clear it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley Quinn sitting on a rocket while flying in space.
[80]
[81]
[82]
DC Rebirth
[
edit
]
In June 2016, the
DC Rebirth
event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles. Both
Harley Quinn
as well as
Suicide Squad
were rebooted, with the latter starting with the one-shot issue
Suicide Squad: Rebirth
#1 (October 2016). Harley Quinn's
DC Rebirth
design included pink and blue dyed hair tips and a jacket inspired by
Margot Robbie
's portrayal of the character in the 2016 film
Suicide Squad
, a change established in the last issues of her
New 52
series.
[83]
[84]
Harley Quinn returned as a regular character in the relaunched
Suicide Squad
series, written by
Rob Williams
. The series was canceled in January 2019.
[85]
Harley Quinn's relaunched ongoing series is a direct continuation of the former, with Conner and Palmiotti still writing for the character, and Hardin and Timms illustrating the interior art.
[86]
After having written 64 issues of Harley Quinn's ongoing series, Conner and Palmiotti's five-year run ended with the 34th issue of the series in December 2017, with writer
Frank Tieri
and artist Inaki Miranda taking over the title.
[87]
[88]
[89]
Tieri's run on the series ended with the series' 42nd issue, followed by a two-issue storyline written by Christopher Sebela and illustrated by
Mirka Andolfo
.
[90]
By issue #45 in July 2018,
Sam Humphries
was the new writer for the series, with John Timms returning to provide art.
[89]
[90]
The series ended in August 2020.
[91]
Harley Loves Joker
[
edit
]
In 2017, Harley Quinn co-creator Paul Dini wrote a backup feature for Harley Quinn's
Rebirth
monthly series entitled
Harley Loves Joker
, co-written by Palmiotti and illustrated by
Bret Blevins
, which ran for 9 issues.
[92]
The story brought back Harley Quinn's classic characterization and focuses on her past with the Joker. Unlike her characterization in
Batman: The Animated Series
, Dini and Palmiotti wrote Harley Quinn in the story as less of a "
doormat
", with Harley Quinn and Joker being on equal footing in their relationship.
[93]
The story concluded with the two-part
limited series
of the same name, which also expanded on Harley Quinn's past as a former intern in animal research at
S.T.A.R. Labs
, where she met her pet
hyenas
Bud and Lou
.
[94]
In the second part of the story, Dini and Palmiotti explained Harley Quinn's change in costume, establishing the character's modern design as a reflection of her having left her relationship with the Joker.
[95]
[96]
Infinite Frontier
[
edit
]
Concept art for Harley Quinn's
Infinite Frontier
design by Riley Rossmo, which combines his favorite aspects of Harley's classic jester getup and more recent designs.
[97]
[98]
For the 2021
Infinite Frontier
relaunch, Harley Quinn is moved back to Gotham City as a superheroine, where she frequently interacts with and aids the Batman family, and she is given a new design by
Riley Rossmo
.
[97]
Harley Quinn's fourth ongoing series, written by Stephanie Phillips and illustrated by Rossmo, depicts her "actively looking to make up for her past sins", alongside a former Joker henchman named Kevin.
[98]
[97]
Harley Quinn also has a prominent role in the "
Fear State
" crossover event.
[99]
In January 2022, Phillips confirmed Harley would be resuming her previous career as a psychologist.
[100]
Powers, abilities, and equipment
[
edit
]
Harley Quinn has no
superpowers
, and relies on her unpredictability,
gymnastics
skills, and weapons and
hand-to-hand
proficiency.
[101]
She is a peak
athlete
, having won a gymnastics
scholarship
at Gotham City's Gotham State University.
[101]
[102]
[21]
Following her transition to the main DC canon in 1999, Harley Quinn was established as having immunity to toxins and enhanced strength, agility, durability, and reflexes, which she received after having been injected with a serum concocted by Poison Ivy.
[101]
"Vengeance Unlimited, Part Five" (
Harley Quinn
vol. 1 #30) revealed that it also gave her the ability to breathe underwater.
[103]
Harley Quinn is skilled in using various weapons, often employing weaponized clown-themed gag items, including
pop guns
,
rubber chickens
, and a gun that shoots a boxing glove, as well as oversized
pistols
and
mallets
, the latter being her signature weapon.
[104]
[105]
[106]
Other weapons she uses include: unconventional weapons, such as a
baseball bat
;
explosive weapons
such as
bazookas
, customized
bombs
, and
dynamites
;
[107]
firearms
, such as
pistols
,
assault rifles
, and
machine guns
;
[107]
Harley Quinn also has a pair of pet hyenas, Bud and Lou, which she can order to attack her opponents.
[101]
Despite being mentally unstable and sometimes distracted, Harley is highly
intelligent
. Her intellect extends to her psychological, tactical and deception abilities, but she does not stand out for particular strategic or scientific skills and often remains subordinate to the Joker, who between the two is the genius and the inventor. Harleen Quinzel earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and as a former Arkham
psychologist
, was highly qualified in
psychoanalysis
,
criminology
, and
forensic psychiatry
. While not on par with Joker, she is still an expert tactician, deceiver and escapologist, and still shows traces of her psychological experience. Harley Quinn is the only person besides the Joker to concoct Joker Venom, the Joker's signature weapon, and is shown to have reverse-engineered its formula and developed an antitoxin.
[108]
[109]
She also has an indomitable pathological will.
Just like Poison Ivy, sometimes and not as much, Harley uses her feminine charm to attract men but only to manipulate them. Unlike the Joker, she is able to simulate sanity, thus being able to pretend to be a "normal" person. In this way, she disguised herself as a security guard, a lawyer and even Poison Ivy and Batgirl.
Romantic interests
[
edit
]
Harley Quinn has had several love interests, the most notable being the Joker and Poison Ivy. Other love interests include Mason Macabre, a character created by Conner and Palmiotti.
[110]
Plastic Man
was initially intended to be a love interest for Harley Quinn by Kesel, but was not approved by DC.
[111]
The Joker
[
edit
]
"So Harley in her earlier incarnation really felt like she was the one for the Joker, that she could catch him and cure him and bring him back to humanity. But actually, in the process, she lost hers. Before she knew it she had fallen head-over-heels in love with him. I think initially he was looking to play her and get what he could out of her, and then realized he had opened Pandora's box and this woman in her madness could match him at just about anything he does. I think he finds that, in some ways, very sexy and attractive. But he's not really set up to love in the way a regular person is. I think there are sparks and intensity and weird passion of a sort to their relationship, but I would not call it a loving relationship in the traditional sense".
Paul Dini, 2017
[11]
The Joker is Harley Quinn's former lover. Harley's solo comics often explore her former association with the Joker through "
flashbacks
of their past exploits, present-day conflicts", or through Harley as she "laments his absence".
[112]
Harley often refers to him as
"Mistah J"
and
"Puddin'"
.
[113]
Their relationship is known for its abusive and
codependent
nature, first established in Harley's first origin story
Mad Love
.
[21]
The Joker habitually abuses Harley, and despite the abuse, Harley Quinn returns to him.
[114]
In the 1999 one-shot comic
Batman: Harley Quinn
, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose.
[115]
Dini describes their relationship as abusive,
[116]
and empathizes with Harley's feelings of
abandonment
, with Dini basing most of Harley's dialogue on his past experiences.
[117]
The Joker's controlling and codependent relationship with Harley Quinn has been analyzed as a means of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman.
[118]
Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try to subject her to his control.
[118]
When Harley successfully defeats Batman in
Mad Love
(1994), the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him; however, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers, which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.
[119]
Poison Ivy
[
edit
]
Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy in "New Roots" from
Batman: Urban Legends
#1, art by Laura Braga.
Poison Ivy is Harley Quinn's current love interest and best friend, and Harley often refers to her as
"Red"
.
[120]
Ivy was first introduced as a new friend to Harley by Dini in the 1993
Batman: The Animated Series
episode "Harley and Ivy".
[121]
The episode came from Dini wanting to make Harley a stronger character and write a story where she leaves the Joker; Dini decided to pair her up with Ivy because she was "the strongest contrast to Harley".
[121]
The two later became close friends within the
DC Animated Universe
. Dini stated that he could see a romantic relationship between the two happening the more he worked with the two characters, but the impossibility of properly portraying their relationship in a kid's cartoon at the time prevented it from happening.
[40]
Prior to the
New 52
reboot, Ivy is shown as having teamed up on occasion with Harley with Harley being her best friend and recurring ally. Unlike most villain team-ups, their partnership is based on genuine friendship and mutual respect. Ivy sincerely wants to save Harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the Joker. Accordingly, Poison Ivy despises the Joker, and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity. In the final storyline of the
Gotham City Sirens
series, Harley suggests that Ivy may be in love with her, an accusation that stuns her.
[122]
The following issue has Poison Ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love Harley, but the details of her love are never specified, and the series ended with the New 52 reboot before their relationship could be addressed.
[123]
Conner and Palmiotti hinted at a romantic relationship in the New 52 Harley Quinn series,
[76]
[72]
and later confirmed that Harley and Ivy are in a non-monogamous relationship.
[124]
[34]
2017's Harley Quinn #25 marked their first canonical kiss.

series, including
Superman: The Animated Series
(1996-2000),
The New Batman Adventures
(1997-1999),
Static Shock
(2000-2004), and
Justice League
(2001-2004), as well as the film
Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker
(2000).
Originally a career-oriented
psychologist
, Dr. Harleen Quinzel's life took a radical turn when she chose to take an internship at
Arkham Asylum
for a semester of college. Convinced by the
Joker
himself to do it, Harleen interviewed him and learned he was abused as a child by his alcoholic father (later learning this backstory to have been one of several different stories he had told to others, some with different details each time), and after more interviews, determined
Batman
was the primary source of the Joker's anger and was to blame for his actions, but that she also had fallen in love with him. Harleen helped the Joker escape and, renaming herself Harley Quinn, became his sidekick in hopes that she could win his love, going on a crime spree across the
United States of America
.
[126]
After assisting Joker in attempting to assassinate Commissioner James Gordon by planting a bomb at a dinner in his honor, she was subdued by Batman, and subsequently an accomplice in virtually all of Joker's criminal schemes.
[127]
On occasion, she would be kicked out of Joker's gang when unintentionally upstaging or annoying the Joker, on one of these occasions teaming up with
Poison Ivy
, with the two becoming close friends and a successful crime duo independently.
[128]
While imprisoned on her own in
Arkham Asylum
, Batman offered her a pardon in exchange for helping him track down the Joker after he had stolen a nuclear bomb.
[129]
The day she is declared rehabilitated and paroled, Harley's hyperactivity and unfamiliarity with the "real" world leads to her accidentally kidnap someone and be returned to Arkham yet again.
[130]
In the 31-episode
Gotham Girls
web series, Harley joins forces with
Poison Ivy
and
Catwoman
in a co-starring role.
After several failed attempts at rehabilitation, Harley returns to the Joker's side. However, after another failed attempt to kill Commissioner Gordon leads the Joker to forget their anniversary, Harley re-examines her life and decides that as Batman was the cause of the Joker's obsession, she should capture and kill him herself for him to kill, doing so by falsely pretending to have found sanity and luring Batman into a trap. Recognizing Harley to have come closer to killing him than Joker has ever done, Batman tricks her into facilitating his escape by making her call the Joker and tell him what she has done, knowing that he would not allow anyone other than himself to kill Batman, pushing her aside and unknowingly knocking her out a window. Recovering in Arkham, Harley decides that the Joker will never truly love her, before returning to her devotion upon seeing that he has left her a rose in a vase from him by her bedside table, with a note hoping that she gets better soon.
[126]
Harley later references having convinced the Joker to attend
couple's counseling
with her.
[131]
In the film
Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker
, flashbacks reveal Harley's apparent final actions after returning to the Joker again were assisting him in kidnapping
Tim Drake
and torturing him into insanity to transform him into their son "J.J", so that they can start a family together. She later fought
Batgirl
who angrily chastised her for even helping Joker commit a heinous act but fell deep into an abyss, leading to the latter presuming her dead, though she survived as depicted in the present, where she appears at the end of the film, revealed to have reformed and become the grandmother of the Jokerz members, the Dee Dee Twins, who address her as "Nana Harley".
DC Universe

Main article:
DC Universe
Harleen Quinzel was a psychologist at Arkham Asylum, and after meeting the Joker, she became his frequent accomplice, took on the name Harley Quinn, and got into an abusive codependent relationship with him. She eventually splits up with him, and becomes a solo criminal, forming a criminal gang called the Quinntets. Following the Quinntet's dissolution, Harley Quinn moves to Metropolis with her best friend Poison Ivy, where she works as a love columnist in the
Daily Planet
under the alias Holly Chance. She then moves back to Gotham City, where she then voluntarily incarcerates herself in Arkham.
[4]
Harley Quinn then spends a year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female Ventriloquist, who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and Commissioner Jim Gordon foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.
[132]
She then briefly joins the
Secret Six
, then decides to quit.
[133]
Final Crisis
[
edit
]
During
Countdown to Final Crisis
, a reformed Harley Quinn resides in an Amazon-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian stola or chiton. She befriends the former Catwoman replacement
Holly Robinson
and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to
Themiscyra
by "Athena" (really
Granny Goodness
) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter Mary Marvel. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to Apokolips. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by Thalia as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to Gotham City.
Gotham City Sirens
[
edit
]
Main article:
Gotham City Sirens
Harley Quinn then joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series
Gotham City Sirens
. In
Gotham City Sirens
#7, Harley Quinn visits her family in her hometown of
Bensonhurst
, Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff". The dysfunctional, "horrible" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together. Following several adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.
[134]
Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.
[122]
Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.
[123]
During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says she saw good in them and only wanted to help. As Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.
[135]
The New 52
and
DC Rebirth

Like her previous incarnations, Harleen Quinzel was still the Joker's psychologist, but before she becomes Harley, the Joker pushes her into a vat of chemicals, bleaching her skin white and driving her insane. Harley Quinn is forced to join the Suicide Squad by Amanda Waller. Harley Quinn then leaves Gotham City and moves back to her hometown of
Brooklyn
and resides in
Coney Island
.
Infinite Frontier
[
edit

Harley Quinn moves back to Gotham City in an attempt to reestablish herself as a hero, aiding the Batman Family and trying to make up for her past "where she often
enabled
the Joker".

Cultural impact
[
edit
]
Harley Quinn cosplayers at various
comic book conventions
.
Harley Quinn has become one of
DC Comics
's most popular characters.
[136]
The 2016 relaunch of her comic shipped more copies than any other
DC Rebirth
title and was one of the best-selling comics of the year.
[137]
DC Comics Publisher
Jim Lee
refers to Harley Quinn as the fourth pillar in their publishing line, behind
Superman
,
Batman
, and
Wonder Woman
.
[138]
[17]
[73]
Harley Quinn currently stars in four separate ongoing series — three eponymous titles and
Suicide Squad
. Only Batman and Superman have comparable numbers of monthly appearances, making Harley Quinn the most prominent and profitable female character.
[138]
Kevin Kiniry, vice-president of DC Collectibles, says Harley Quinn is always a top-seller and she "can go toe-to-toe with Batman and the
Joker
as one of the most fan-requested and sought-after characters".
[138]
In 2016, Harley Quinn's
Halloween
costume ranked as the most popular costume in both the United States and the
United Kingdom
and it remains a popular subject for
cosplay
.
[139]
[140]
To celebrate the character, DC Comics declared the month of February to be Harley Quinn Month and published 22 Harley Quinn
variant covers
across their line of comic books.
[141]
IGN
's 2009 list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Harley Quinn as #45.
[142]
She was ranked 16th in
Comics Buyer's Guide
'
s 2011 "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.
[143]
Joker voice actor Mark Hamill attributes the success of Harley Quinn to Arleen Sorkin's performance.
[144]
On
Twitter
, he stated: "In the script she was just an unnamed Joker "hench-wench" w/ no discernible personality. When Arleen began reading her lines in that unforgettable voice so poignant & full of heart I nearly fell off my chair! She brought SO much more than was on the page & a legend was born".

Other versions
[
edit
]
Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the
Elseworlds
miniseries
Thrillkiller
. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named
Hayley Fitzpatrick
who dresses up to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase. After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.
[146]
In the
Elseworlds 80-Page Giant
, one of the stories is about
Lex Luthor
as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "
alternative lifestyle
folkies
Ivy and Harley".
[147]
On the new
Earth-3
, Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager and is killed by the
Owlman
.
[148]
Harley appears in
Batman/The Spirit
. In this crossover, Harley is one of the many villains who helps try to take down Batman and the
Spirit
. She initially appears disguised as a flight attendant.
In the
2008 graphic novel
Joker
, Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and
aide-de-camp
. She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.
[149]
In
Batman: Damned
, the sequel to
Joker
, Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building, and defacing the Bat-Signal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress and strangles Harley against the Bat-Signal.
[150]
In the
Ame-Comi Girls
universe, Harley is partnered with the
Catwoman
and
Poison Ivy
as part of a trio of villains.
The
Flashpoint
version of Harley Quinn is named
Yo-Yo
. She was a henchwoman of the
Joker
, and the
Batman
chased her down to find the Joker's location, as she had kidnapped
Judge Dent
's children. He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but she is luckily saved by
Cyborg
.
[151]
In
Batman '66
, a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress, and red blouse, a large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as
Dr. Holly Quinn
, Ph.D., a psychologist at
Arkham Asylum
, referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.
[152]
Dr. Quinn is manipulated by the Catwoman and the Joker to perfect the Joker Wave — a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects — freeing the people of Gotham but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a
roller derby
-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of
Matches Malone
) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.
[153]
Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game
Injustice: Gods Among Us
. She helps the Joker kidnap
Lois Lane
and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is
Doomsday
) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In

In
Batman: White Knight
, it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured
Robin
(
Jason Todd
), and she was replaced by another girl,
Marian Drews
, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured of his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting "normal". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the "fake Harley" unconscious, and reveals to Jack Napier (the Joker's true identity in this continuity) there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker "despite his flaws", Marian loved the Joker by "his flaws". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself "until the real Joker returns", calls herself the
Neo Joker
, and later romances Poison Ivy.

She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead of beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.

On Robbie's portrayal of the character in the film, Dini commented: "I think they really got the essence of the character down, and they made her quite a lot of fun and appealing in so many ways. She's not totally the animated version, and it's not totally the Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner version, but it kind of borrows from all of them and creates its own reality and its own fun. There are so many moments in that movie that I just think are wonderful. [...] When I saw her running, laughing hysterically, pushing a shopping cart full of
Peeps
, I said, "That's my girl". All those little
impish
things that she did in the movie - sitting down eating cereal, watching

.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
The monument was one of three planned as part of the city's 1892 commemoration of the 400th anniversary of
Columbus' landing in the Americas
.
[4]
Originally, the monument was planned to be located in
Bowling Green
or somewhere else in
lower Manhattan
. By the time Russo's plan was decided upon in 1890, a commission of Italian businessmen from around the United States had contributed $12,000 of the $20,000 needed to build the statue (equivalent to $391,000 of the $651,000 in cost in current dollars).
[5]
The statue was constructed with funds raised by
Il Progresso
, a New York City-based Italian-language
newspaper
.
[2]
Russo created parts of the Columbus Column in his
Rome
studio and in other workshops in Italy;
[4]
the bronze elements were cast in the
Nelli Foundry
.
[6]
The completed column was shipped to the United States in September 1892 to be placed within the "circle at Fifty-ninth Street and Eighth Avenue".
[7]
Once the statue arrived in Manhattan, it was quickly transported to the circle.
[3]
The monument was officially unveiled with a ceremony on October 13, 1892, as part of the 400th anniversary celebration.
[8]
[9]
[10]
: 287
During the construction of the
New York City Subway
's
Eighth Avenue Line
(
A
, -
B
, -
C
, and -
D
trains) underneath the circle in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Columbus statue was shored up with temporary supports.
[11]
Even so, the statue was shifted two inches north from its original position, and the top of the statue tilted 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). As a result, the statue was repaired and cleaned in 1934.
[12]
The monument received some retouching in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage, and in turn, the monument's own 100th anniversary.
[10]
: 288
It was also rededicated in that same year.
[13]
In 2012, the statue was used as the centerpiece of an interactive art installation by
Tatzu Nishi
entitled
Discovering Columbus
. The
Public Art Fund
described the project as follows:
Nishi’s project re-imagines the colossal 13-foot-tall statue of Columbus standing in a fully furnished, modern living room. Featuring tables, chairs, couch, rug, and flat-screen television, the décor reflects the artist’s interpretation of contemporary New York style. He even designed wallpaper inspired by memories of American popular culture, having watched Hollywood movies and television as a child in Japan. Discovering Columbus offers both a unique perspective on a historical monument and a surreal experience of the sculpture in a new context. Allowing us to take a journey up six flights of stairs to a fictional living room, Tatzu Nishi invites us to discover for ourselves where the imagination may lead.
[14]
Amid the
2017 monument controversies
in the United States, an issue arose over the statue due to criticism of
Columbus's brutality and his abuse of the native people
on
Hispaniola
. In August of that year, the far-right
Unite the Right rally
in
Charlottesville, Virginia
, had resulted in one death and several injuries. Following that rally, Mayor
Bill de Blasio
commissioned a "90-day review" of possibly "hateful" monuments across the city to determine if any of them, including the Columbus Column, warranted either removal or recontextualization (e.g. by
explanatory plaques
).
[15]
[16]
[17]
Although calls to remove the monument were supported by those criticizing Columbus's actions, the proposed removal was opposed by some sectors of the city's Italian American community and
Columbus Day Parade organizers
.
[18]
[19]
After two instances of vandalism in September 2017, including one incident where the statue was defaced with red paint,
[17]
full-time security measures were put around the column ahead of the year's parade.
[20]
On September 20, 2018, in a unanimous decision, the
New York State Board of Historic Preservation
voted to place the monument on the state historic register and nominate it to the
National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), due to its significance.
[21]
Two months later the
National Park Service
added the monument to the NRHP.
[22]
On September 19, 2023, Italian Prime Minister
Giorgia Meloni
visited the monument and, during a ceremony, laid a wreath in honor of Columbus.

Ford Lee "Buck" Washington
(October 16, 1903 - January 31, 1955) was an American
vaudeville
performer, pianist, and singer. He was best known as half of the duo Buck and Bubbles, who were the first black artists to appear on television, with
John W. Bubbles
, his performance partner for 40 years.
[1]
Career
[
edit
]
Washington was born in
Louisville, Kentucky
. He and Bubbles (born John W. Sublett) first began working together in the 1910s, while Washington was in his teens. Their duo was known as "Buck and Bubbles." Bubbles was primarily a
tap dancer
while Washington sang and played
stride piano
and sang.
[2]
They were so popular that the duo moved to
Manhattan, New York City
in September 1919. By the late 1920s they were on
Broadway
. They played together in the Columbia Theater, the Palace, performing with
Eddie Cantor
,
Al Jolson
, and
Danny Kaye
.
[3]
They were on the
Ziegfeld Follies
of 1931.
[4]
They also became the first black artists to perform at the
Radio City Music Hall
. They toured Europe in the 1930s and appeared on television and in films, including
Calling All Stars
(1937) and
Cabin in the Sky
(1942). The Buck and Bubbles act was represented by
Nat Nazarro
.
[5]
"Buck and Bubbles" performed live in the
first scheduled 'high definition' (240-line) television program
on November 2, 1936, at
Alexandra Palace
, London, for the
BBC
, becoming the first black artists on television anywhere in the world.
[3]
[2]
[6]
In 1927, when Buck and Bubbles were performing at the Sunset Café, Buck developed a working relationship and friendship with Louis Armstrong.
[7]
As a pianist, Washington also did sessions with
jazz
musicians such as
Louis Armstrong
(1930),
Bessie Smith
(1933), and
Coleman Hawkins
(1934). He also played trumpet, though he only made home recordings on the instrument. He continued working with Bubbles until 1953, and in 1953-1954 worked with
Timmie Rogers
and
Jonah Jones
. He died in 1955 in
New York City
.
[8]
Family
[
edit
]
On August 23, 1927, in
Chicago
, Washington married Flash Amber Vincson (1902-1975). One of her younger sisters, Bobbie Vincent
(née
Bobbye Vincson; 1906-1978), was a singer and dancer who performed in the 1925 production of
Chocolate Kiddies
during its inaugural European tour.

The modern
political history of the United Kingdom
(1979-present) began when
Margaret Thatcher
gained power in 1979
, giving rise to 18 years of
Conservative
government. Victory in the
Falklands War
(1982) and the government's strong opposition to
trade unions
helped lead the Conservative Party to another three terms in government. Thatcher initially pursued
monetarist
policies and went on to privatise many of Britain's nationalised companies such as
British Telecom
,
British Gas Corporation
,
British Airways
and
British Steel Corporation
. She kept the National Health Service.  The controversial
"poll tax"
to fund local government was unpopular, and the Conservatives removed Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990, although
Michael Heseltine
, the minister who did much to undermine her, did not personally benefit from her being ousted.
Thatcher's successor,
John Major
, replaced the "poll tax" with
Council Tax
and oversaw successful British involvement in the
Gulf War
. Despite a recession, Major led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in
1992
. The events of
Black Wednesday
in 1992, party disunity over the
European Union
and several scandals involving Conservative politicians all led to the
Labour Party
winning a
landslide election victory
under
Tony Blair
in
1997
. Labour had shifted its policies from the political left closer to the centre, under the slogan of '
New Labour
'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and
Scotland
and
Wales
were given a devolved
Scottish Parliament
and
Welsh Assembly
respectively, whilst London wide local government was also re-established in the form of a
Assembly
and
Mayor
. The
Good Friday Agreement
was negotiated in 1997 in an effort to end
The Troubles
in
Northern Ireland
, with a devolved, power-sharing
Northern Ireland Assembly
being established in 1998.
Blair led Britain into the
Afghanistan
and
Iraq Wars
before leaving office in 2007, when he was succeeded by his Chancellor,
Gordon Brown
. A
global recession in 2008-10
led to Labour's defeat in the
2010 election
. It was replaced by a Conservative-
Liberal Democrat
coalition government, headed by
David Cameron
, that pursued a series of public spending cuts with the intention of reducing the budget deficit. In 2016, the UK
voted in an advisory referendum to leave the European Union
, which led to Cameron's resignation. Cameron was succeeded by his Home Secretary,
Theresa May

May engaged in a policy to take the country out of the European Union through her flagship
Brexit withdrawal agreement
. When this deal failed to pass through the House of Commons three times, May resigned. The subsequent
Conservative leadership election
was won by former
Foreign Secretary
and
Mayor of London
,
Boris Johnson
, who became Prime Minister in July 2019. A Conservative landslide victory in the general election five months later allowed for a majority government and the UK's withdrawal from the EU in January 2020. Amid numerous scandals and a government crisis, Johnson resigned in September 2022 and was succeeded by his Foreign Secretary

Elizabeth II

Margaret Thatcher
Thatcher
formed a government
on 4 May 1979, with a mandate to reverse the UK's economic decline and to reduce the role of the state in the economy. Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the
Civil Service
that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of Empire, and wanted the country to punch above its weight in international affairs. She was a philosophic soulmate with
Ronald Reagan
,
elected President in 1980 in the United States
, and to a lesser extent,
Brian Mulroney
, who was
elected in 1984 in Canada
. It seemed for a time that
conservatism
might be the dominant political philosophy in the major
English-speaking nations
for the era.

Northern Ireland
was in a violent phase.
[1]
Insurgents planted bombs and assassinated its foes, including in 1979
Airey Neave
, Thatcher's close friend who was expected to take charge there. The
Irish National Liberation Army
(INLA), a republican paramilitary group, claimed responsibility. On 27 August 1979,
the IRA assassinated
Lord Mountbatten
, a member of the royal family, and other units
killed 18 soldiers
with a
roadside bomb
.
[2]
[3]
Sheer luck on the early morning of 12 October 1984 saved Thatcher's life as
five were killed by a bomb
planted by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army
in
Brighton's Grand Hotel
during the Conservative Party conference.
[4]
In 1981, a new tactic was used to mobilize support, as
Provisional IRA
and Irish National Liberation Army prisoners went on
hunger strikes
to claim legitimacy for their cause in the act of making the ultimate sacrifice.
[5]
It was a historic tactic that was revived for maximum impact, although it was attacked by the major news media and denounced by
Catholic
bishops.
[6]
Thatcher continued the policy of "
Ulsterisation
" promoted by the previous Labour government, believing that the
unionists
of
Ulster
should be at the forefront in combating
Irish republicanism
. This meant relieving the burden on the mainstream
British Army
and elevating the role of the
Ulster Defence Regiment
and the
Royal Ulster Constabulary
.
[7]
In November 1985, Thatcher signed the Hillsborough
Anglo-Irish Agreement
, bringing the
Dublin government
into the peace process.  P. J. McLoughlin finds the consensus of scholars is that it was a significant factor contributing to the development of the
Northern Ireland peace process
.
[8]
However, the agreement was greeted with fury by Irish unionists. The
Ulster Unionists
and
Democratic Unionists
made an electoral pact and on 23 January 1986, staged an ad hoc referendum by re-fighting their seats in by-elections, and won with one seat lost to the nationalist
Social Democratic and Labour Party
(SDLP). Then, unlike the
Sunningdale Agreement
in 1974, they found they could not bring the agreement down by a general strike. This was another effect of the changed balance of power in industrial relations. The Hillsborough agreement stood, and Thatcher punished the unionists for their non-cooperation by abolishing the
devolved assembly
she had created only four years before.
[9]
Economics
[
edit
]
Main article:
Economic history of the United Kingdom
In economic policy, Thatcher and her Chancellor Sir
Geoffrey Howe
started out with policies, including higher interest rates, to
drive down the rate of growth of the money supply
. She had a preference for indirect taxation over taxes on income: in 1979
exchange controls
were abolished and the top rate of income tax on "unearned" income cut from 98% to 60%, but
value added tax
(VAT) was increased sharply to 15% with the result that inflation also rose. These moves hit businesses, especially in the
manufacturing sector
, and
unemployment
- which had stood at 1,500,000 by the time of the 1979 general election - was above 2,000,000 by the end of 1980. It continued to rise throughout 1981, passing the 2,500,000 mark during the summer of that year - although inflation was now down to 12% compared to 27% two years earlier. The economy was now in
recession
.
Her early tax policy reforms were based on the monetarist theories of
Milton Friedman
rather than the
supply-side economics
of
Arthur Laffer
and
Jude Wanniski
, which the government of
Ronald Reagan
espoused. There was a
severe recession in the early 1980s
, and the Government's economic policy was widely blamed. In January 1982, the inflation rate dropped to single figures and interest rates fell. Unemployment peaked at 3.1 million and remained at that level until 1986.
[10]
The recession of the early 1980s was the deepest in Britain since the depression of the 1930s and Thatcher's popularity plummeted; most predictions had her losing the next election.
Falklands War
[
edit
]
Main article:
Falklands War
The British sank the Argentine cruiser
ARA General Belgrano
during the Falklands War.
In Argentina, an
unstable military junta
was in power and keen on reversing its huge economic unpopularity. On 2 April 1982, it invaded the
Falkland Islands
, the only invasion of a British territory since
World War II
.
Argentina has claimed
the islands since an 1830s dispute on their settlement. Thatcher sent a naval task force to recapture the Islands. The ensuing
Falklands War
saw the swift defeat of Argentina in only a few days of fighting, resulting in a wave of patriotic enthusiasm for Thatcher personally, at a time when her popularity had been at an all-time low for a serving Prime Minister. Opinion polls showed a huge surge in Conservative support which would be sufficient to win a general election. In the end, the war probably raised the Conservative vote by about six points, according to scholarly studies of the polling data.
[11]
[12]
This "
Falklands Factor
", as it came to be known, was crucial to the scale of the landslide Conservative majority in the
June 1983 general election
, with a fragmented Labour Party enduring its worst postwar election result, while the
SDP-Liberal Alliance
(created two years earlier in a pact between the
Liberal Party
and the new
Social Democratic Party (UK)
formed by disenchanted former Labour MP's) trailed Labour closely in terms of votes but won few seats.
[13]
[14]
Hong Kong
[
edit
]
Main article:
Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong
China demanded the return of Hong Kong with the expiration of Britain's 99-year lease on most of the territory in 1997. Thatcher negotiated directly in September 1982 with that country's leader
Deng Xiaoping
.
[15]
They agreed on the
Sino-British Joint Declaration
over the Question of Hong Kong which provided for a peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to Beijing's control in 15 years' time, after which the city would be allowed to retain its "capitalistic" system for another 50 years.
Thatcher's strong opposition against communism as represented by the Soviet Union as well as the decisive military victory against Argentina, re-affirmed Britain's influential position on the world stage and bolstered Thatcher's firm leadership. In addition the economy was showing positive signs of recovery thanks mainly to substantial
oil revenues from the North Sea
.
[16]
Nuclear disarmament
[
edit
]
Main article:
Anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom
The 1983 election was also influenced by events in the opposition parties. Since their 1979 defeat, Labour was increasingly dominated by its "
hard left
" that had emerged from the 1970s union militancy, and in opposition its policies had swung very sharply to the left while the Conservatives had drifted further to the
right
. This drove a significant number of right wing Labour members and MPs to form a breakaway party in 1981, the
Social Democratic Party
. Labour fought the election on
unilateral nuclear disarmament
, which proposed to abandon the British nuclear deterrent despite the threat from a nuclear armed Soviet Union, withdrawal from the
European Community
, and total reversal of Thatcher's economic and trade union changes. Indeed, one Labour MP,
Gerald Kaufman
, has called the party's 1983 manifesto "the longest suicide note in history". Consequently, upon the Labour split, there was a new centrist challenge, the
SDP-Liberal Alliance
, from the Social Democrats in electoral pact with the
Liberal Party
, to break the major parties' dominance and win
proportional representation
. The British Electoral Study found that Alliance voters were preferentially tilted towards the Conservatives
[2]
, but this possible loss of vote share by the Conservatives was more than compensated for by the
first past the post
electoral system, where marginal changes in vote numbers and distribution have disproportionate effects on the number of seats won.  Accordingly, despite the Alliance vote share coming very close to that of Labour and preventing an absolute majority in votes for the Conservatives, the Alliance failed to break into Parliament in significant numbers and the Conservatives were returned in a landslide.
Trade union power
[

Main articles:
Trade unions in the United Kingdom
and
UK miners' strike (1984-85)
Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the trade unions but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched
strikes
that were wholly or partly aimed at damaging her politically.  The most significant of these was carried out by the
National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM). However, Thatcher had made preparations long in advance for an NUM strike by building up coal stocks, and there were no cuts in electric power, unlike
1972
. Police tactics during the strike concerned
civil libertarians
: stopping suspected strike sympathisers travelling towards coalfields when they were still long distances from them,
phone tapping
as evidenced by Labour's
Tony Benn
, and a violent
battle with mass pickets
at
Orgreave, Yorkshire
. But images of massed militant miners using violence to prevent other miners from working, along with the fact that (illegally under a recent Act) the NUM had not held a national ballot to approve strike action.
Arthur Scargill
's policy of letting each region of the NUM call its own strike backfired when nine areas held ballots that resulted in majority votes against striking,
[17]
and violence against strikebreakers escalated with time until reaching a tipping point with the
killing of David Wilkie
(a taxi-driver who was taking a strikebreaker to work). The
Miners' Strike
lasted a full year, March 1984 until March 1985, before the drift of half the miners back to work forced the NUM leadership to give in without a deal. Thatcher had won a decisive victory and the unions never recovered their political power. This aborted political strike marked a turning point in UK politics: no longer could militant unions remove a democratically elected government. It also marked the beginning of a new economic and political culture in the UK based upon small government intervention in the economy and reduced dominance of the trade unions and welfare state.
Thatcher's political and economic philosophy
[
edit
]
Further information:
Thatcherism
Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised
free markets
and
entrepreneurialism
. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small nationalised company, the
National Freight Company
, to its workers, with a surprisingly large response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and sold off many of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of
privatisation
, while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with Thatcherism.
Thatcher with President
Ronald Reagan
, 1986.
In the
Cold War
, Thatcher supported
Ronald Reagan's policies
of
Rollback
with the goal of reducing or ending Soviet Communist power.
[18]
This contrasted with the policy of
détente
which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies still wedded to the idea of détente. The
United States Armed Forces
were permitted by Mrs. Thatcher to station nuclear
cruise missiles
at
British Armed Forces
bases, arousing mass protests by the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of reformist Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev
, declaring she liked him and "We can do business together" after a meeting three months before he came to power in 1985. This was a start in swinging the West back to a new détente with the Soviet Union in his era, as it proved to be an indication that the Soviet regime's power was decaying. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and voices who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and détente postures.
She supported the
US bombing raid on Libya
from bases in the UK in 1986 when other NATO allies would not. Her liking for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the
Westland affair
when she acted with colleagues to prevent the helicopter manufacturer
Westland
, a vital defence contractor, from linking with a European Consortium including the Italian firm
Agusta
in favour of a link with
Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
of the United States. Defence Secretary
Michael Heseltine
, who had pushed the European Consortium, resigned in protest at her style of leadership, and thereafter became a potential leadership challenger. Trade and Industry Secretary
Leon Brittan
then had to resign for having ordered the leak of a confidential legal letter critical of Heseltine; Thatcher survived the crisis as her personal involvement in the leak was not proven.
By winning the
1987 general election
, by another landslide on the economic boom (with unemployment finally falling below 3,000,000 that spring) and against a stubbornly anti-nuclear Labour opposition (now led by
Neil Kinnock
Following
Michael Foot
's resignation four years earlier), she became the longest serving
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
since the 1820s. Most newspapers supported her - with the exception of
The Daily Mirror
and
The Guardian
— and were rewarded with regular press briefings by her press secretary,
Bernard Ingham
.
She was known as "Maggie" in the popular tabloids, which inspired the well-known
"Maggie Out!" protest song
, sung throughout that period by some of her opponents. Her unpopularity on the left is evident from the lyrics of several contemporary popular songs: "Stand Down Margaret" (
The Beat
), "Tramp the Dirt Down" (
Elvis Costello
), "Mother Knows Best" (
Richard Thompson
), and "Margaret on the Guillotine" (
Morrissey
).
[19]
Many opponents believed she and her policies created a significant north-south divide from the
Bristol Channel
to
The Wash
, between the "haves" in the economically dynamic south and the "have nots" in the northern rust belt.  Hard welfare reforms in her third term created an adult Employment Training system that included full-time work done for the dole plus a £10 top-up, on the
workfare
model from the US. The "Social Fund" system that placed one-off welfare payments for emergency needs under a local budgetary limit, and where possible changed them into loans, and rules for assessing jobseeking effort by the week, were breaches of social consensus unprecedented since the 1920s.
The sharp fall in unemployment continued. By the end of 1987, it stood at just over 2,600,000 - having started the year still in excess of 3,000,000. It stood at just over 2,000,000 by the end of 1988, and by the end of 1989 less than 1,700,000 were unemployed. However, total economic growth for 1989 stood at 2% - the lowest since 1982 - signalling an end to the economic boom. Several other countries had now entered recession, and fears were now rife that Britain was also on the verge of another recession.
[20]
In 1988, Thatcher, a trained chemist, became concerned with
environmental issues
, putting on the national agenda such technical issues as
global warming
,
ozone depletion
and
acid rain
. In 1990, she opened the
Hadley Centre
for
climate prediction and research
.
[21]
In September 1988, at
Bruges
, Thatcher announced her opposition to proposals from the
European Community
for a
federal structure
and increasing centralisation of decision-making. Although she had supported
British membership
, Thatcher believed that the role of the EC should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that new EC regulations would reverse the changes she was making in the UK. "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a new super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels". The speech caused an outcry from other European leaders, and exposed for the first time the deep split that was emerging over European policy inside her Conservative Party. Since 1985 Thatcher had been blocking British membership of the
Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM), a preparation for
Economic and Monetary Union
, through which a single currency would replace national currencies, which the EC began seriously to discuss by 1990.
Thatcher's popularity once again declined in 1989 as the economy suffered from high interest rates imposed to stop an unsustainable
boom
. She blamed her Chancellor,
Nigel Lawson
, who had exacerbated the boom by trying to keep the
pound sterling
low ("shadowing the
Deutschmark
") as a preparation for
European Exchange Rate Mechanism
membership; Thatcher claimed not to have been told of this and did not approve. At the
Madrid
European summit, Lawson and Foreign Secretary
Geoffrey Howe
forced Thatcher to agree the circumstances under which she would join the ERM. Thatcher took revenge on both by demoting Howe, and by listening more to her adviser Sir
Alan Walters
on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.
That November, Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by Sir
Anthony Meyer
. As Meyer was a virtually unknown
backbench
MP, he was viewed as a
stalking horse
candidate for more prominent members of the party.  Thatcher easily defeated Meyer's challenge, but there were 60 ballot papers either cast for Meyer or abstaining, a surprisingly large number for a sitting Prime Minister.
Thatcher's new system to replace
local government rates
was introduced in
Scotland
in 1989 and in
England
and
Wales
in 1990. Rates were replaced by the "
Community Charge
" (more widely known as the
poll tax
), which applied the same amount to every individual resident, with only limited discounts for low earners. This was to be the most universally unpopular policy of her premiership, and saw the Conservative government split further behind the Labour opposition (still led by
Neil Kinnock
) in the opinion polls. The Charge was introduced early in Scotland as the rateable values would in any case have been reassessed in 1989. However, it led to accusations that Scotland was a 'testing ground' for the tax. Thatcher apparently believed that the new tax would be popular, and had been persuaded by
Scottish Conservatives
to bring it in early and in one go. Despite her hopes, the early introduction led to a sharp decline in the already low support for the Conservative party in Scotland.
Additional problems emerged when many of the tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions.  Some have argued that local councils saw the introduction of the new system of taxation as the opportunity to make significant increases in the amount taken, assuming (correctly) that it would be the originators of the new tax system and not its local operators who would be blamed.
A large London demonstration against the poll tax in
Trafalgar Square
on 31 March 1990 - the day before it was introduced in
England and Wales
- turned into a
riot
. Millions of people resisted paying the tax. Opponents of the tax banded together to resist
bailiffs
and disrupt court hearings of poll tax debtors. Mrs Thatcher refused to compromise, or change the tax, and its unpopularity was a major factor in Thatcher's downfall.
By the autumn of 1990, opposition to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (especially high interest rates of 15%, which were undermining her core voting base within the home-owning, entrepreneurial and business sectors), and the divisions opening within her party over the appropriate handling of
European integration
made Thatcher and her party seem increasingly politically vulnerable. Her increasingly combative, irritable personality also made opposition to her grow fast and by this point, even many in her own party could not stand her.

John Major
contested the second round and defeated
Michael Heseltine
as well as Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd
, becoming prime minister on 28 November 1990.
[22]
By this stage, however, Britain had slid into recession for the third time in less than 20 years. Unemployment had started to rise in the spring of 1990 but by the end of the year it was still lower than in many other
European economies
, particularly
France
and
Italy
.
British troops in the Gulf
John Major
was Prime Minister during British involvement in the
Gulf War
. Polls improved for the Conservatives despite the recession deepening throughout 1991 and into 1992, with the economy for 1991 falling 2% and unemployment passing the 2,000,000 mark.
[23]
Major called a
general election
for April 1992 and took his campaign onto the streets, famously delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox as in his Lambeth days. This populist "common touch", in contrast to the Labour Party's more slick campaign, chimed with the electorate and Major won, albeit with a small parliamentary majority.
[24]
The narrow majority for the
Conservative government
proved to be unmanageable, particularly after the United Kingdom's forced exit from the
Exchange Rate Mechanism
on
Black Wednesday
(16 September 1992) just five months into the new parliament. From this stage onwards, Labour - now led by
John Smith
- was ascendant in the opinion polls. Major allowed his economic team to stay in place unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before forcing the resignation of his Chancellor,
Norman Lamont
, whom he replaced with
Kenneth Clarke
. This delay was seen as indicative of one of his weaknesses, an indecisiveness towards personnel issues that was to undermine his authority through the rest of his premiership.
[25]
At the 1993 Conservative Party Conference, Major began his ill-fated  "
Back to Basics
" campaign, which he intended to be about the economy, education, policing, and other such issues, but it was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) as an attempt to revert to the moral and family values that the Conservative Party were often associated with. A number of sleaze scandals involving Conservative MP's were exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail in tabloid newspapers following this and further reduced the Conservative's popularity. Despite Major's best efforts, the Conservative Party collapsed into political infighting. Major took a moderate approach but found himself undermined by the right-wing within the party and his Cabinet.
Major's policy towards the
European Union
aroused opposition as the Government attempted to ratify the
Maastricht Treaty
. Although the Labour opposition supported the treaty, they were prepared to undertake tactical moves to weaken the government, which included passing an amendment that required a vote on the social chapter aspects of the treaty before it could be ratified. Several Conservative MPs (the
Maastricht Rebels
) voted against the Government and the vote was lost. Major hit back by calling another vote on the following day (23 July 1993), which he declared a
vote of confidence
. He won by 40 but had damaged his authority.
[25]
One of the few bright spots of 1993 for the Conservative government came in April when the end of the recession was finally declared after nearly three years.  Unemployment had touched 3,000,000 by the turn of the year, but had dipped to 2,800,000 by Christmas as the economic recovery continued.   The economic recovery was strong and sustained throughout 1994, with unemployment falling below 2,500,000 by the end of the year.  However, Labour remained ascendant in the opinion polls and their popularity further increased with the election of
Tony Blair
- who redesignated the party as
New Labour
- as leader following the sudden death of
John Smith
on 12 May 1994.
[26]
Labour remained ascendant in the polls throughout 1995, despite the Conservative government overseeing the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment.
[27]
It was a similar story throughout 1996, despite the economy still being strong and unemployment back below 2,000,000 for the first time since early 1991.
[28]
The
Railways Act 1993
[29]
was introduced by
John Major
's
Conservative
government and passed on 5 November 1993. It provided for the restructuring of the
British Railways Board
(BRB), the public corporation that owned and operated the national railway system.  A few residual responsibilities of the BRB remained with
BRB (Residuary) Ltd.
Few were surprised when Major lost the
1997 general election
to
Tony Blair
, though the immense scale of the landslide defeat was not widely predicted. In the new parliament Labour won 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, leaving the Labour party with a majority of 179 which was the biggest majority since
1931
. In addition, the Conservatives lost all their seats in Scotland and Wales and several cabinet ministers including
Michael Portillo
,
Malcolm Rifkind
and
Ian Lang
lost their seats, as did former cabinet minister
Norman Lamont
. Major carried on as
Leader of the Opposition
until
William Hague
was elected to lead the Conservative Party the month after the election.

Tony Blair
Tony Blair
became Prime Minister in 1997 after a
landslide victory
over the Conservative Party. Under the title of
New Labour
, he promised economic and social reform and brought Labour closer to the
centre
of the political spectrum. Early policies of the
Labour government
included the
minimum wage
and the introduction of university
tuition fees
.
Chancellor of the Exchequer
,
Gordon Brown
also gave the
Bank of England
the power to set the base rate of interest autonomously. The traditional tendency of governments to manipulate interest rates around the time of general elections for political gain is thought to have been deleterious to the UK economy and helped reinforce a cyclical pattern of
boom and bust
. Brown's decision was popular with
the City
, which the Labour Party had been courting since the early 1990s. Blair presided over the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century and his premiership saw large investment into social aspects, in particular health and education, areas particularly under-invested during the Conservative government of the 1980s and early 1990s. The
Human Rights Act
was introduced in 1998 and the
Freedom of Information Act
came into force in 2000. Most hereditary peers were removed from the
House of Lords
in 1999 and the
Civil Partnership Act
of 2005 allowed homosexual couples the right to register their partnership with the same rights and responsibilities comparable to heterosexual marriage.
From the beginning, New Labour's record on the economy and unemployment was strong, suggesting that they could break with the trend of Labour governments overseeing an economic decline while in power. They had inherited an unemployment count of 1,700,000 from the Conservatives, and by the following year unemployment was down to 1,300,000 - a level not seen since
James Callaghan
was in power some 20 years previously. A minimum wage was announced in May 1998, coming into force from April 1999.
[31]
Unemployment would remain similarly low for the next 10 years.
[32]
Blair addresses Armagh in 1998
The long-running
Northern Ireland peace process
was brought to a conclusion in 1998 with the
Belfast Agreement
which established a devolved
Northern Ireland Assembly
and de-escalated the violence associated with
the Troubles
. It was signed in April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and was endorsed by all the main political parties in Northern Ireland with the exception of
Ian Paisley
's
Democratic Unionist Party
. Voters in Northern Ireland approved the agreement in a referendum in May 1998 and it came into force in December 1999. In August 1998, a car-bomb
exploded
in the Northern Ireland town of
Omagh
, killing 29 people and injuring 220. The attack was carried out by the
Real Irish Republican Army
who opposed the Belfast Agreement. It was reported in 2005, that the IRA had renounced violence and had ditched its entire arsenal.
In foreign policy, following the
11 September 2001 attacks
in the United States, Blair greatly supported U.S. President
George W. Bush
's new
War on terror
which began with the forced withdrawal of the
Taliban
regime in
Afghanistan
. Blair's case for the subsequent
Iraq War
was based on their
alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction
and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for
regime change
, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that "the
Iraqi military
are able to deploy
chemical
or
biological weapons
within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the "
Dodgy Dossier
".
British troops in the
Afghan War
.
46,000 British troops, one-third of the total strength of the
British Army
(land forces), were deployed to assist with the
invasion of Iraq
. When after the war, no WMDs were found in Iraq, the two dossiers, together with Blair's other pre-war statements, became an issue of considerable controversy. Many Labour Party members, including a number who had supported the war, were among the critics. Successive independent inquiries (including those by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons, the senior judge
Lord Hutton
, and the former senior civil servant
Lord Butler of Brockwell
) have found that Blair honestly stated what he believed to be true at the time, though Lord Butler's report did imply that the Government's presentation of the intelligence evidence had been subject to some degree of exaggeration. These findings have not prevented frequent accusations that Blair was deliberately deceitful, and, during the
2005 election campaign
, Conservative leader
Michael Howard
made political capital out of the issue. The new threat of international terrorism ultimately led to the
7 July 2005 bomb attacks
in London which killed 52 people as well as the four suicide bombers who led the attack.
The Labour government was re-elected with a second successive landslide in the
general election
of June 2001.
[33]
Blair became the first Labour leader to lead the party to three successive election victories when they won the
2005 general election
, though this time he had a drastically reduced majority.
[34]
The Conservatives had so far failed to represent a serious challenge to Labour's rule, with
John Major
's successor
William Hague
unable to make any real improvement upon the disastrous 1997 general election result at the next election four years later. He stepped down after the 2001 election to be succeeded by
Iain Duncan Smith
, who did not even hold the leadership long enough to contest a general election - being ousted by his own MP's in October 2003
[35]
and being replaced by
Michael Howard
, who had served as
Home Secretary
in the
previous Conservative government
under
John Major
. Howard failed to win the 2005 general election for the Conservatives but he at least had the satisfaction of narrowing the Labour majority, giving his successor (he announced his resignation shortly after the election) a decent platform to build upon.
[36]
However, the Conservatives began to re-emerge as an electable prospect following the election of
David Cameron
as Howard's successor in December 2005. Within months of Cameron becoming Conservative leader, opinion polls during 2006 were showing a regular Conservative lead for the first time since Black Wednesday 14 years earlier. Despite the economy still being strong and unemployment remaining low, Labour's decline in support was largely blamed upon poor control of
immigration
and allowing Britain to become what was seen by many as an easy target for terrorists.
[37]
Devolution
[
edit
]
Main article:
Devolution in the United Kingdom
Blair also came into power with a policy of
devolution
. A pre-legislative
referendum
was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions:  whether to create a
devolved Parliament for Scotland
and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. Following a clear 'yes' vote on both questions in Scotland, a
referendum
on the proposal for creating a
devolved Assembly for Wales
was held two weeks later. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. The
first general election to the Scottish parliament
saw the creation of a
Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition
with
Donald Dewar
as
First Minister
. Following the
first election to the Welsh Assembly
, the Labour Party formed a
minority government
with
Alun Michael
as the
Welsh First Minister
. In the
2007 Scottish general election
, the
Scottish National Party
gained enough seats to form a
minority government
with its leader
Alex Salmond
as First Minister.
Devolution also returned to
Northern Ireland
, leaving England as the only constituent
country of the United Kingdom
without a devolved administration. Within England, a
devolved authority for London
was re-established following a 'yes' vote in a London-wide referendum.
Gordon Brown (2007-10)
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Premiership of Gordon Brown
and
Brown ministry
Gordon Brown
Tony Blair
tendered his resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the Queen on 27 June 2007, his successor
Gordon Brown
assuming office the same afternoon. Brown took over as Prime Minister without having to face either a general election or a contested election for leadership of the Labour Party.
Brown's style of government differed from that of his predecessor,
Tony Blair
, who had been seen as presidential. Brown rescinded some of the policies which had either been introduced or were planned by Blair's administration. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the Iraq war, although he established an inquiry into the reasons why Britain had participated in the conflict. He proposed a "government of all the talents" which would involve co-opting leading personalities from industry and other professional walks of life into government positions. Brown also appointed
Jacqui Smith
as the UK's first female Home Secretary, while Brown's old position as Chancellor was taken over by
Alistair Darling
.
Brown was closer to American thinking, and more distant from Europe, than Blair. In major issues with foreign policy complications, He paid close attention to both the
United States
and the
European Union
, especially regarding the deregulation of the
Bank of England
, the
Welfare to Work
program, and his response to the
worldwide financial crisis
at the
G20 summit in London in 2009
. Brown decided in 1997 to follow the American model and grant operational independence to set interest rates to the
Bank of England
, rather than have the power remain with the Treasury. He explained the Bank's monetary policy objective "will be to deliver price stability and...to support the Government's economic policy."
[38]
Brown argued for a neoliberal policy on welfare in 1997. His goal was to move people off welfare and into actual employment. He stated:
We cannot build a dynamic economy unless we can unleash the potential and everyone. A welfare state that thwarts the opportunities that we need to hold the economy back. A welfare state that encourages work is not only fair but makes for greater dynamism in the economy.
[39]
Brown's reaction to the great 2008 banking crisis was much more pro active than France or Germany, and in many ways resembled the Bush policies in Washington. Brown's goals were to provide more liquidity to the financial system, to recapitalise the banks and to guarantee bank debt. He lowered the VAT to encourage consumer spending and to keep the economy from sinking.
[40]
Brown's rise to prime minister sparked a brief surge in Labour support as the party topped most opinion polls. There was talk of a "snap" general election, which it was widely believed Labour could win, but Brown decided against calling an election.
[41]
Brown's administration
introduced a number of fiscal policies to help keep the
British economy
afloat during the
financial crisis
which occurred throughout the latter part of the 2000s (decade) and early 2010, although the United Kingdom saw a dramatic increase in its national debt. Unemployment soared through 2008 as the
recession
set in, and Labour standings in the opinion polls plummeted as the Conservatives became ascendant.
[42]
Several major banks were nationalised after falling into financial difficulties, while large amounts of money were pumped into the economy to encourage spending. Brown was also press ganged into giving
Gurkhas
settlement rights in Britain by the actress and campaigner
Joanna Lumley
and attracted criticism for its handling of the
release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi
, the only person to have been convicted over the
1988 Lockerbie bombing
.
Further
European integration
was introduced under the Labour governments after 1997, including the
Treaty of Amsterdam
(1997) and the
Treaty of Nice
(2001). The
Treaty of Lisbon
(2007)introduced many further changes.  Prominent changes included more
qualified majority voting
in the
Council of Ministers
, increased involvement of the
European Parliament
in the legislative process through extended
codecision
with the Council of Ministers, eliminating the
pillar system
established by the Maastricht Treaty of the early 1990s and the creation of a
President of the European Council
with a term of two and a half years and a
High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
to present a united position on EU policies. The
Treaty of Lisbon
will also make the Union's human rights charter, the
Charter of Fundamental Rights
, legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty also leads to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the
Council of the European Union
from 8.4% to 12.4%. In July 2008 the Labour government under
Gordon Brown
approved the treaty.
[43]
Initially, during the first four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a solid lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may be due to his handling of numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity had fallen significantly, with two contributing factors believed to be his perceived change of mind over plans to call a
snap general election
in October 2007, and his handling of the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and dithering. His unpopularity led eight labour MPs to call for a
leadership contest
in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to his perceived strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit an all-time low, and his position became increasingly under threat after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009
Local
and
European elections
. Brown's cabinet began to rebel with several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009.
In January 2010, it was revealed that Britain's economy had resumed growth after a recession which had seen a record six successive quarters of economic detraction. However, it was a narrow return to growth, and it came after the other major economies had come out of recession.
[44]
The
2010 general election
resulted in a
hung parliament
- Britain's first for 36 years - with the Conservative Party controlling 306 Seats, the Labour Party 258 Seats and the Liberal Democrats 57 Seats. Brown remained as
caretaker prime minister
while the
Liberal Democrats
negotiated with Labour and the Conservatives to form a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely, and on 11 May Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party. This paved the way for the Conservatives to return to power after 13 years.
[45]
His deputy
Harriet Harman
became Leader of the Opposition until September 2010, when
Ed Miliband
was elected Leader of the Labour Party.

Nick Clegg

War in Afghanistan
and stated that he hopes to remove British troops from the region by 2015. An
emergency budget
was prepared in June 2010 by Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne
which stated that VAT will be raised to 20% and there will be a large reduction in public spending. A key Liberal Democrat policy is that of voting reform, to which a
referendum
took place in May 2011 on whether or not Britain should adopt a system of
Alternative Vote
to elect MPs to Westminster. However, the proposal was rejected overwhelmingly, with 68% of voters in favour of retaining first-past-the-post.  The Liberal Democrat turnabout on tuition policy at the universities alienated their younger supporters, and the continuing weakness of the economy, despite spending cutbacks, alienated the elders.
In March 2011, UK, along with France and USA voted for military intervention against Gaddafi's Libya leading to

Following years of austerity, the British economy was on an upswing in 2015. In line with the
Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011
, the
2015 general election
was called for 7 May 2015. The Conservatives claimed credit for the upswing, promising to keep taxes low and reduce the deficit as well as promising an In/out referendum on the UK's relationship with the European Union. The opposition Labour Party called for a higher minimum wage, and higher taxes on the rich. In Scotland, the SNP attacked the
austerity programme
, opposed
nuclear weapons
and demanded that promises of more autonomy for Scotland made during the independence referendum be delivered.
Pre-election polls had predicted a close race and a
hung parliament
, but the surprising result was that a
majority Conservative government
was elected. The Conservatives with 37% of the popular vote held a narrow majority with 331 of the 650 seats. The other main victor was the
Scottish National Party
which won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. Labour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and 232 seats; they lost 40 of their 41 seats in Scotland. The
Liberal Democrats
vote fell by 2/3 and they lost 49 of their 57 seats, as their coalition with the Conservatives had alienated the great majority of their supporters. The new
UK Independence Party
(UKIP), rallying voters against Europe and against immigration, did well with 13% of the vote count. It came in second in over 115 constituencies but came in first in only one. Women now comprise 29% of the MPs.

On 23 June 2016, UK voters elected to withdraw from the European Union by a thin margin with 48% in favour of remaining, 52% in favour of leaving the European Union. London, Scotland, and Northern Ireland were three regions most in favour of the
Remain vote
, while Wales and England's northern region were strongly
pro-Leave
. Although he called for the referendum, British Prime Minister
David Cameron
had campaigned ardently for the Remain vote. He faced significant opposition from other parties on the right who came to view
British membership in the European Union
as a detriment to the country's security and economic vitality.
UK Independence Party
leader
Nigel Farage
called the vote Britain's "independence day".

The premiership of
Boris Johnson
began on 24 July 2019 when
Johnson
accepted
Queen Elizabeth II
's invitation, at her
prerogative
, to form an administration.
On 3 September 2019, Johnson threatened to call a general election after opposition and rebel Conservative MPs successfully voted against the government to take control of the order of business with a view to preventing a
no-deal exit
.
[60]
The
Benn Act
, a bill to block a no-deal exit, passed the Commons on 4 September 2019, causing Johnson to call for a
general election set for 12 December 2019
.
[61]
After several votes, a new election was approved for December 2019, in which the Conservative Party won an 80-seat majority, partially assisted by the
Brexit Party
, formed earlier in the year, agreeing to only campaign in non-Conservative seats. On 31 January 2020, Johnson took the country out of the
European Union
with the new Brexit deal he negotiated.
[62]
[63]
He also oversaw the impact of
Brexit on the Irish border
, with his ministry negotiating the terms of the
Northern Ireland Protocol
.
[64]
Johnson then oversaw the
government's response
to the
COVID-19 pandemic
in which the government imposed
national lockdowns
,
health programs
, and
vaccination rollouts
. The
economic effects
of the pandemic, Brexit, and other factors led to
a cost-of-living crisis
beginning in 2021 which saw the prices of many goods and services to skyrocket in the United Kingdom.
[65]
The
Russian invasion of Ukraine
in February 2022 led Johnson to support Ukraine financially and militarily, with Johnson traveling to
Kyiv
to visit with
Ukrainian
President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
.
[66]
[67]
Various scandals rocked the Johnson ministry throughout 2022 including Johnson personally
being served a fine
for
Partygate
, in which
10 Downing Street
was revealed to host social gatherings during the nationwide lockdown orders during the
pandemic
.
[68]
[69]
The
embroilment of Chris Pincher in a sex scandal
led to
mass resignations
in Johnson's cabinet, leading Johnson to announce his resignation in July 2022. However, Johnson served as caretaker PM for several weeks until new leader had been chosen.

Queen Elizabeth II's
invitation for Truss to form a government was one of her last acts as monarch before her death just two days later. This saw
Charles III
ascend to the throne and
the funeral of the late monarch
dominating Truss's first weeks in office.
[72]
Truss and Chancellor
Kwasi Kwarteng
unveiled a "

. The budget received significant backlash, with the price of the pound as well as Truss's approval rating to fall to record lows.
[73]
[74]
Kwarteng resigned, with
Jeremy Hunt
taking over as Chancellor, who reversed all proposals of the mini-budget within days; however this did not alleviate the
political pressure
on Truss. She announced her resignation on 20 October 2022, making her the shortest serving Prime Minister to date.

Design and development
[
edit
]
In September 1924, the
Naval Aircraft Factory
was tasked with designing a long-range twin-engined
flying boat
, capable of flying the 2,400 mi (3,860 km) between
San Francisco
and
Hawaii
. The initial design was carried out by Isaac Laddon, an employee of
Consolidated Aircraft
, and then passed to Boeing for detailed design and construction. The new flying boat, the Boeing Model 50, was a
two-bay
biplane
of very streamlined design for flying boats of the time.  The wings were of metal construction, with wooden wingtips and leading edges.  The fuselage had a metal lower part, with the upper half made of laminated wooden frames with a wood veneer covering.  Two 800 hp (600 kW)
Packard 2A-2500
V12 engines
driving four-bladed propellers were mounted in tandem between the wings above the fuselage.

Boeing XPB-1
The Boeing Model 50, designated
XPB-1
by the US Navy, made its maiden flight in August 1925.
[2]
It was intended to use it to lead a pair of
Naval Aircraft Factory PN-9s
in an attempt to fly to Hawaii on 31 August 1925, but engine trouble led to its participation in the flight being cancelled.
[3]
[4]
In 1928, the aircraft was modified by the Naval Aircraft Factory, its Packard engines were replaced by two 500 hp (370 kW) geared
Pratt & Whitney R-1690
Hornet
radial engines
, leading to the new designation
XPB-2

Natural and technological risks
[
edit
]
The city is exposed to some natural risks :
Flood risk due to the fact that the Sioule goes through the city. The last significant flood has been recorded in year 1982.
Earthquake hazard : low risk zone.
as well as two industrial risks :
Transport of hazardous substances: County roads 2009 and 46 (East) record significant traffic, including trucks. Besides, two gas pipelines go across the city.
Dam failure : It concerns the dam "des Fades", which can cause a flood, the wave being felt 4 hours after the failure.
The entire county is exposed to storm risk. 150 km/h winds have been recorded just before the year 2000.
Two prevention plans of natural risks have been prescribed on the basins of the "Sioule" and of the "Allier", and have both been approved respectively in year 1999 and 2008.
Personalities
[
edit
]
Durandus of Saint-Pourçain
(ca.1275 - 1332), an important scholastic theologian and philosopher, member of the
Dominican order
, was born here.
French diplomat and cryptographer
Blaise de Vigenère
was born in the town in 1523.

Light, semi-transparent mirror
The pellicle mirror of the
Canon EOS RT
A
pellicle mirror
is an ultra-thin, ultra-lightweight
semi-transparent
mirror employed in the light path of an optical instrument, splitting the light beam into two separate beams, both of reduced light intensity. Splitting the beam allows its use for multiple purposes simultaneously. The thinness of the mirror practically eliminates beam or image doubling due to a non-coincident weak second reflection from the nominally non-reflecting surface, a problem with mirror-type
beam splitters
.
[1]
The name
pellicle
is a diminutive of
pellis
, a skin or film.
In photography
[
edit
]
In photography, the pellicle mirror has been employed in
single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras
, at first to enable through-the-lens exposure measurement and possibly to reduce camera shake, but later most successfully to enable fast series photography, which otherwise would be slowed down by the movement of the reflex mirror, while maintaining constant finder vision.
[2]
The first use of pellicle mirrors for consumer photography however were in color separation cameras. The Devin Tricolor Camera from at least the 1938 version used two pellicle mirrors plus three color filters to split the image from a single lens into three images of the three additive primary colors.
[1]
Pellicle mirrors are ideal for this purpose, even today, since they are lighter and cheaper than an optical block of dichroic prisms, which would be heavy and expensive for large, high resolution film or plates.
The conventional
SLR camera
has a reflex mirror directing the light beam from the lens to the focusing screen in the viewfinder, which is swung out of the light path when the exposure is made and causing the viewfinder to go dark. This action adds a delay between pressing the shutter release and the actual exposure of the film.
[3]
The first camera to employ the pellicle mirror as a beam splitter for the viewfinder was the
Canon Pellix
, launched by
Canon Camera Company Inc. Japan
in 1965. The object was to accomplish exposure measurement through the lens
(TTL)
, which was pioneered by
Tokyo Kogaku KK, Japan
in the 1963
Topcon
RE Super. That employed a
CdS
meter cell placed behind the reflex mirror that had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell. Canon improved on the idea by making the mirror semi-translucent and fixed. The meter cell was swung into the light-path behind the mirror by operating a lever on the right-hand camera front for stopped down exposure reading, momentarily dimming the viewfinder. Two thirds of the light from the camera lens was let through the mirror, while the rest was reflected up to the viewfinder screen.
[4]
The Pellix pellicle mirror was an ultra-thin (0.02 mm) Mylar film with a vapour deposited semi reflecting layer. Since there was no mirror blackout, the user could see the image at the moment of exposure.
[5]
The next 35mm SLR camera to employ the pellicle mirror was the
Canon F-1 High Speed
, made available in the event of the 1972 Olympic games, the object being rapid series photography, difficult at the time to obtain with a moving mirror. The mirror design was the same as in the Pellix.
[5]
In 1984, Canon released another version of their then
"New F-1"
, which attained a record 14
frames per second
performance, being the fastest analog SLR of that time.
Nippon Kogaku KK, Japan
introduced their high-speed
Nikon F2
H in 1976. The mirror is a pellicle rather than a conventional front surfaced mirror that swings out of the light path when the exposure is made. To identify the F2H, note the shutter speed dial has no T, B or 1/2000; has no
self-timer
and has a non-removable Type B
focusing screen
.
[6]
Two further Canon models were produced with pellicle mirrors, the
EOS RT
and the EOS-1N RS, the RT being based on the
EOS 600
/
EOS 630
and the 1N RS being based on the
EOS-1N
.
As development of SLR cameras has progressed since these early models, fast sequence shooting has apparently become possible using ordinary moving mirrors in high-speed cameras, getting rid of the vulnerable pellicle mirror that was prone to dust and dirt. The mirror mechanism of conventional SLR cameras has improved since the Pellix mirror was introduced; the viewfinder is dark for only a very short time, the
shutter lag
is small, and the mirror-return is fast enough for rapid shooting. Digital SLR cameras are able to take ten frames or more per second employing an instant-return mirror.
Sony SLT concept
[
edit
]
Main article:
Sony SLT camera
Sony has introduced cameras with plastic
[7]
pellicle-like mirrors, which it describes as "Single-Lens Translucent" cameras.
[8]
These cameras divert a portion of incoming light to a phase-detection
autofocus
unit, while the remaining light strikes a digital
image sensor
. Sony "SLT" cameras employ an
electronic viewfinder
(EVF) allowing
exposure value
,
white balance
and other settings to be verified and adjusted visually before taking a picture, although typically the EVF displays far less
dynamic range
than the sensor. The refresh rate of the viewfinder is limited by the time it takes the sensor to make a usable exposure; thus in low light the frame rate of the viewfinder may be as low as four frames per second. "SLT" cameras also lack a real-time view at high shooting rates, when the viewfinder shows the last picture taken instead of the one being taken — a phenomenon comparable to certain older SLRs that can only achieve their maximum burst rate in
mirror lock-up
.
Motion-picture cameras
[
edit
]
Few film movie cameras have been made that make use of the pellicle mirror. Probably the earliest is the Pathé WEBO M, m for membrane, of 1946. With that camera light is reflexed sideways into a primary plano-convex finder lens, the plane side being partially or fully matted. Another French amateur movie camera with a pellicle is the Christen Reflex for Double-Eight film. It was made from 1960 on and provides a lightly slanted deflection. Later, in 1967, the professional Mitchell NCR and BNCR cameras were equipped with a pellicle-based finder. In the Soviet Union in 1970 appeared the Kiev 16 Alpha, also featuring a pellicle mirror finder system that deflects strictly vertically.
Advantages and disadvantages
[
edit
]
Advantages of a pellicle mirror:
The user has an uninterrupted view through the viewfinder while making an exposure.
There is no vibration from mirror movement, reducing shake and audible noise. At the same time, the system is devoid of play or backlash.
Shutter lag may be diminished, and pictures taken at a faster rate, compared to systems employing a reflex mirror.
Continuous phase-detection autofocus during video, live view or continuous shooting mode.
Disadvantages of a pellicle mirror:
The pellicle mirror causes an up to 1/3-
stop
loss of light at the receptor, and a corresponding 2-
stop
loss of light in the
viewfinder
The mirror has to be kept perfectly clean, or the light sensor and other electronics (as well as the image quality) will suffer.
Owing to its thinness, the pellicle mirror is fragile, making it difficult to clean.
As the viewfinder does not go dark, there is no visual indication that the shutter has fired. This could be a problem in a noisy environment where the shutter cannot be heard.

.
Early life and career
[
edit
]
Russo was born to a father of the same name who played baseball as a catcher for the
Philadelphia Phillies
.
[2]
[3]
He is a native of
Syracuse
,
New York
, and graduated from
Fayetteville-Manlius High School
in 1993.
[4]
[5]
Russo received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the
Juilliard School
in New York City and did post-graduate study in France and Germany.
[6]
He participated in the
Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition
in 1998, returned to New York at the age of 25, and created Music Journeys Inc., a nonprofit youth educational foundation.
[3]
[6]
Russo played in the
Van Cliburn International Piano Competition
in 2001, and released
Voice of the Whale
, an album of songs by composer
George Crumb
, for the British label Black Box Records in 2002.
[2]
[5]
[7]
Subsequent albums for Black Box,
Corigliano: Violin Sonata; Etude Fantasy; Fantasia on an Ostinato; Chiaroscuro
(2006),
Aaron Jay Kernis: 100 Greatest Dance Hits
(2007),
Paul Schoenfield: Four Parables; Four Souvenirs; Café Music
(2007), and
Mix Tape
(2008) received positive reviews by
Allmusic
.
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
Russo's 2007 album
Dirty Little Secret
for Endeavour Classics was favorably reviewed by
Allmusic
and
The New York Times
.
[12]
[13]
Politics
[
edit
]
In November 2009, Russo announced his candidacy for the 49th
New York State Senate
district as a
Republican
in the
2010 state election
.
[14]
He had become a registered Republican on June 24, 2009 and was previously registered as a Democrat from 1995 to 2006, when he changed his registration to independent.
[15]
[16]
The 49th Senate district is represented since 2005 by
Democrat
David Valesky
.
[17]
Russo named as his goals the implementation of term limits, the reduction of taxes, a spending freeze, and the removal of discretionary spending by individual senators.
[18]
Russo attacked Valesky over his support for
same-sex marriage
and for "broken promises", "painful tax hikes", and "failed leadership".
[18]
[19]
In December 2009,
The Post-Standard
reported that Russo had rarely voted since registering in 2001.
[15]
Russo maintained he had voted in 2006 and 2008, and had failed to vote more often because he had lived outside of the country.
[15]
Michael Long, chairman of the
Conservative Party of New York State
, stated on March 3, 2010, that Russo would be the Conservative Party candidate over of his Republican contender,
East Syracuse
mayor
Danny Liedka
.
[20]
In May 2010, the Senate Republican Campaign Committee endorsed Russo over Liedka for the primary election.
[21]
Russo won the primary election on September 14 and became the Republican and Conservative candidate.
[22]
Russo sought to run on the
Taxpayers Party of New York
ballot line but
New York State Board of Elections
spokesman John Conklin stated on September 10, 2010, that too many of Russo's collected signatures were determined to be invalid for him to receive the line.
[23]
Valesky's campaign staff criticized Russo afterwards for having "no clue who is in this senate district".
[23]
In the general election, Valesky had a lead in early October in fundraising and opinion polling.
[24]
Russo's campaign sought to portrait Valesky as a professional politician dependent on his party leadership and Valesky's campaign played up Russo's incomplete voting record and absence from the state.
[25]
Russo's campaign publicly demanded Valesky return donation from Democratic State Senate leaders, whose names were included in a government report alleging unethical business dealings.
[26]
Valesky's campaign in turn requested Russo return donations originating in the
Seneca Nation of New York
, which is suing New York over taxes on reservations.
[26]
The candidates and their parties committed about two million dollars combined to the election, because the election could decide what party wins a majority in the New York State Senate.
[25]
The Post-Standard
on November 2, 2010, predicted the election to be close.
[27]
Russo lost to Valesky.
[28]
Personal life

Russo lives in
Fayetteville

in Indonesia. The initial suspension was only for two weeks but it was extended to 29 May 2020. However, the government blocked every attempt to resume the competition.

On 27 June 2020,
PSSI
issued a decree to continue Liga 1 from October 2020.
[12]
After failing to obtain government and police permissions for the umpteenth time, PSSI on 29 September 2020 announced the second postponement of the 2020 season of Liga 1 and Liga 2. This time the initial suspension had a one-month period. After the end date was reached, PSSI on 29 October 2020 declared the 2020 football seasons could not be held in 2020. There was an attempt to resume the 2020 season in 2021. However, on 15 January 2021, PSSI decided to cancel the 2020 season of all football competitions and declared them void.

2021 season plans
[
edit
]
PSSI and PT LIB plan to hold the 2021 season in coordination with the
Indonesian Police
and other state agencies despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in
Indonesia
, the country with the most COVID-19 cases in
Southeast Asia
. The original plan was to hold it from 11 June 2021 and finish on 11 March 2022. After months of debate, PSSI decided against eliminating the relegation and promotion system, an option that many cash-strapped clubs proposed. PSSI also changed the starting date to early July 2021. COVID-19 restrictions in many cities on
Java
island delayed the commencement to late August 2021.
[15]
[16]
In order to obtain government permission, PSSI and PT LIB themselves had to incorporate various COVID-19 restrictions for the 2021 season, including disallowing fans to be inside or outside the stadium before, during, and after matches. Only a maximum of 299 people, including players, coaches, team officials, security personnel, and special guests, are allowed to enter the stadium. In addition, all entrants are required to be tested, pass temperature checks, wear masks, and follow other health protocols. All players also must be fully vaccinated to be eligible to play. All matches are expected to be played on main island of
Java
to reduce contagion risks from air travel, leading to protests from non-Java teams that must relocate their base to a Java city.
[17]
[18]
As a simulation for the 2021 season, PSSI held the
2021 Menpora Cup
as a pre-season tournament for the Liga 1 teams. The event was held as a reference in implementing health protocols so that government and police officials become convinced that professional football matches would not turn into super-spreader events.
[19]
2021 format
[
edit
]
Cognizant of the fluctuating situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, PSSI and PT LIB decided the league format will be divided into six series that consider the infection levels across Java island. Each series will cover 45-54 matches (five to six matchdays) played in multiple designated regions to ensure no club will play in their home grounds. The venues can change days ahead of schedule if certain regions are deemed as COVID-19 red zones or violations to COVID-19 rules occurred at a specific stadium.
[20]
The first series (six matchdays) will be held in the provinces of
Banten
,
West Java
, and
DKI Jakarta
with six stadiums (
Benteng Taruna Stadium
,
Pakansari Stadium
,
Patriot Stadium (Indonesia)
,
Wibawa Mukti Stadium
,
Gelora Bandung Lautan Api Stadium
and
Jalak Harupat Stadium
). The second series is planned to be held in the provinces
Central Java
and
Special Region of Yogyakarta
with five stadiums (
Jatidiri Stadium
, Citarum Stadium,
Manahan Stadium
,
Maguwoharjo Stadium
and
Sultan Agung Stadium
). The third series is planned to entirely run in
East Java
province but in different nine stadiums (
Gelora Bung Tomo Stadium
,
Gelora 10 November Stadium
,
Kanjuruhan Stadium
,
Gajayana Stadium
,
Surajaya Stadium
,
Petrokimia Stadium
,
Gelora Delta Stadium
,
Brawijaya Stadium
,
Gelora Bangkalan Stadium
).
[21]
The fourth and fifth series will be held in
Bali
with limited supporters in four stadiums (
Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium
(Gianyar),
Ngurah Rai Stadium
(Denpasar),
Kompyang Sujana Stadium
(Denpasar), and
Samudra Stadium
(Badung)), before the sixth and last series is planned to take place at venues in the kick-off series in the provinces of
Banten
,
West Java
, and
DKI Jakarta
.
[22]
Teams
[
edit
]
Eighteen teams are competing in the league - all teams retained from the scrapped
2021-22 season
.
Name changes
[
edit
]
In early 2020, TIRA-Persikabo changed its name to
Persikabo 1973
.
[23]
[24]
In late 2020, Bhayangkara relocated to
Surakarta
from
Jakarta
and changed its name to
Bhayangkara Solo
.
[25]
However, the changes were annulled, according to PSSI in its 2021 annual congress.

A Dubious Legacy
(1992) is a novel written by the British author
Mary Wesley
. The story takes place in the
West Country
, England, from 1944 to 1990. It concerns the tragic and bizarre marriage of the Tillotsons and their relationship with two young couples who keep visiting them throughout the years.
Plot summary
[
edit
]
While stationed abroad during
World War II
Henry Tillotson has married a complete stranger at his father's  request. When the war is over, and his father has died, Henry brings his bride with him back to his estate, Cotteshaw, in the
West Country
. The first thing the bride does on their arrival is to give her husband a black eye and without a word march upstairs to her bedroom where she will reside for the best part of the rest of her life.
Two young couples, Antonia and Matthew, and Barbara and James, begin to visit Cotteshaw frequently. Unwilling to admit it, the two young ladies are attracted to the fifteen years older Henry Tillotson, and fascinated and frightened by his mysterious wife, Margaret, who will endure their visits in her bedroom with bored superiority. Margaret Tillotson is beautiful - but mad. She likes to make up malicious stories about everyone at Cotteshaw and enjoys inflicting pain on everyone who comes into range, preferably without lifting her head from the pillow. Her husband reacts to her fancies with indulgence and nauseating kindness while he tries to be a host to his guests.
The nature of his wife means that Henry Tillotson is in need of an heir, and Margaret refuses to divorce him. However, the two couples keep returning to Cotteshaw throughout the years, and every time Henry is the perfect and attentive host, especially to Antonia and Barbara.
Characters
[
edit
]
Henry Tillotson: The magnanimous owner of Cotteshaw
Margaret Tillotson:  Henry's  wife who rarely gets out of bed.
Antonia: Married to Matthew and the mother of Susie and Clio.
Barbara: A close friend of Antonia's. Married to James and the mother of Hilaria.
Matthew: Married to Antonia and the father of Susie and Clio.
James: Married to Barbara and the father of Hilaria.
Pilar: The housemaid. Brought to Cotteshaw by Henry's  father.
Ebro: Pilar's  son.
Trask: The butler and odd-job man at Cotteshaw.
Basil: Margaret Tillotson's  American brother.
Calypso and Hector Grant: Have been friends with Henry Tillotson for years. Live near Cotteshaw.
The Jonathans: A homosexual couple. Henry's  friends since childhood and possibly his half-brothers.
Peter and Maisie Bullivant: The Tillotsons´ rather tactless neighbours.
Susie: Matthew's  and Antonia's  oldest daughter.
Clio: Matthew's and Antonia's  youngest daughter.
Hilaria: James's  and Barbara's  only child.
Valerie: James's  former girl-friend. Never seen, but often mentioned.
Themes
[
edit
]
In Wesley's  fiction the safe marriage is a recurring theme; people rarely get married out of love. In that respect
A Dubious Legacy
is an extreme case: Henry Tillotson has married Margaret because it was his father's  last wish; Margaret married Henry because she was stranded in
Egypt
and needed a British passport. Matthew enjoys the thought that Antonia is still a virgin and sees her as some kind of conquest; Antonia wants to marry Matthew because he can provide for her, so she can give up her job. Barbara is James's  second choice, but his first choice has just dumped him and he needs a consolation and wants to start a family, and Barbara marries James because she wants to get away from home and her parents.
Another recurring fictional theme in Wesley's  books is the
affirmation of illegitimacy
(Hebe in
Harnessing Peacocks
, Emily Thornby in
Not That Sort of Girl
, Mary Mowbray in
The Vacillations of Poppy Carew
, Polly in
The Camomile Lawn
and Juno in
Part of the Furniture
). In the case of
A Dubious Legacy
Antonia and Barbara both have an affair with Henry Tillotson, and about nine months later they both have a daughter. Antonia's  and Barbara's  respective husbands know nothing about their wives´ infidelity, and they may very well be the fathers of the two baby girls themselves. They have no reason to think otherwise. Antonia and Barbara will never know the true identity of the father for certain. However, Henry seems to be convinced that the children are his. When he finds the two pregnant women soaked and freezing by the lake he becomes worried and cries out: "Let´s  get you home. I don´t  want to lose my babies".
[1]
Trivia
[
edit
]
The script of
A Dubious Legacy
was delivered by hand to Wesley's  publisher in
London
, by a street cleaner who had found it in a litter bin on the South Bank. Apparently it had fallen out of a Post Office van.

Whose Garden Was This
is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter
John Denver
, consisting mainly of
cover songs
. It was released in October 1970.  This album was subsequently re-released as bonus tracks on re-releases of the albums
John Denver
and
Spirit
. British singer
Dame Vera Lynn
recorded the title song in 1972 for her album
Unforgettable Songs by Vera Lynn
. Actually, Vera Lynn was keen to sing the song on her BBC television show (1972) but felt the song was a little too short and asked Tom Paxton for a further verse to be added - and he duly obliged - with the 'forest/squirrels' one. Subsequently he often sang this later version in concert.

The
Monte Capezzone
(in
Titzschu
Jungebärg
[3]
) is a mountain in the
Pennine Alps
of north-western
Italy
; with an elevation of 2,421 m (7,943 ft) is the highest peak of the
Strona
Valley.
Geography
[
edit
]
Monte Capezzone (right) and Cima Lago
The mountain is located at the
tripoint
between three valleys:
Valstrona
,
Valle Anzasca
and Valle
Mastallone
(the latter a side valley of
Valsesia
). The Sesia/Anzasca wayer divide goes on westwards with Monte Mora (2,298 m (7,539 ft)) and Cima Cresta 2,316 m (7,598 ft). From the summit of Monte Capezzone starts the dividing range between Val Strona and Val Mastallone which, heading South, after the
Colle della Crocetta
and the
Cima Lago
(2,401 m (7,877 ft)) reaches the
Altemberg
(
Alpi Cusiane
). Estwards the
water divide
between the valleys of the
Strona
and the
Anza
heads towards the
Monte Massone
.  Administratively the summit of Monte Capezzone is the
tripoint
where the borders of the
comunes
of
Rimella
(
VC
),
Calasca-Castiglione
(
VB
) and
Valstrona
(
VB
) meet.
[4]
Close to the main elevation of the mountain stands a
cross
.
[5]
SOIUSA classification
[
edit
]
According to the
SOIUSA
(
International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps
) the mountain can be classified in the following way:
[6]
main part =
Western Alps
major sector = North Western Alps
section =
Pennine Alps
subsection = Eastern Aosta and Northern Valsesia Alps
supergroup = Contrafforti valsesiani del Monte Rosa
group = Costiera Punta Grober-Tagliaferro-Montevecchio
subgroup = Contrafforte Montevecchio-Quarazzola-Capezzone
code
= I/B-9.III-C.7.b/b
Geology
[
edit
]
At the foot of the Capezzone a geologic survey discovered gold mineralizations embedded in
schistose
rock layers.
[7]
Access to the summit
[
edit
]
Panorama from the summit
The summit of the Capezzone can be accessed starting from
Campello Monti
(a former autonomous
comune
now belonging to
Valstrona
). After the
bivouac
Abele Traglio
, located on the Lake Capezzone shore, a waymarked track reaches the
Colle della Crocetta
saddle and, turning right, climbs the Sesia/Stona ridge up to the
summit cross
.
[5]
The
Colle della Crocetta
can also be reached from
Rimella
with an uneasy hiking itinerary.
[8]
Nature conservation
[
edit
]
The slopes of Monte Capezzone facing
Valstrona
and
Valsesia
are part of the
regional park
of
Alta Val Sesia e dell'Alta Val Strona
.
[9]
The area is also preserved by the establishment of
S.C.I.
named "Campello Monti" (code IT1140003) and of a whider protected area named
Alta Val Strona e la Val Segnara
(code IT1140020).

Rhizr
[
edit
]
Rhizr is an online learning tool which brings together learners of similar interests and provides a space to share thoughts, work together, and build off of ideas. Users are able to create, remix and share educational resources amongst each other.
[24]
Rhizr was created in 2017
[25]
by a team of researchers, developers, and content creators at the Gottesman Libraries of Teachers College Columbia University.
[26]
The mSchool initiative paved the way for what is now known as Rhizr.
[27]
The name is a metaphor based on a
Rhizome
, which is a structure of roots and nodes organized in a random and non-hierarchically structure. "Rhizomatic learning" is based on ideas from
Gilles Deleuze
.
[28]
Rhizr utilizes modules so that users can share, organize and save information in a non-linear way with a format that is similar to
Trello
.
[29]
In June 2019 a new version of Rhizr was released by EdLab with greater flexibility and faster search.

The
Poltava Governorate
[a]
or
Poltavshchyna
[1]
was a
gubernia
(also called a province or government) in the historical
Left-bank Ukraine
region of the
Russian Empire
. It was officially created in 1802 from the disbanded
Little Russia Governorate
, which was split between the
Chernigov Governorate
and Poltava Governorate with an administrative center of
Poltava
.

of
Ukraine
, although some: Zolotonosha, Krasnohrad, Pereiaslav and Romny are now part of
Cherkasy
,
Kharkiv
,
Kyiv
and
Sumy Oblasts
respectively.
The Poltava Governorate covered a total area of 49,365 km
2
, and had a population of 2,778,151 according to the
1897 Russian Empire census
. It was bordering the following Russian Governorates:
Chernigov Governorate
and
Kursk Governorate
to the
north
,
Kiev Governorate
to the
west
,
Kharkov Governorate
to the
east
,
Kherson Governorate
and
Yekaterinoslav Governorate
to the
south
. In 1914, the population was 2,794,727. After the formation of the
Ukrainian SSR
, the territory was wholly included into the new Soviet Republic. Initially the governorate system was retained although variations included the
Kremenchug Governorate
[
uk
]
which was temporarily formed on its territory (August 1920 - December 1922), and the passing of the Pereyaslav uezd to the
Kiev Governorate
.
However, on Third of June 1925 the guberniya was liquidated and replaced by five okrugs (which already were the
uyezd
subdivision as of seventh of March 1923): Kremenchutsky, Lubensky, Poltavsky, Prylutsky and Romensky (the rest two okrugs existed within the guberniya, Zolotonoshsky and Krasnohradsky, were also liquidated).

Operational history
[
edit
]
Pre-World War One
[
edit
]
Defender
and her sisters formed the
First Destroyer Flotilla
and were attached to the
Grand Fleet
in 1914.
Battle of Heligoland Bight
[
edit
]
On 28 August 1914 the Royal Navy and the
Imperial German Navy
met at the
Battle of Heligoland Bight
.  When the German Destroyer
V-187
was hit by eight British destroyers and sank with heavy loss of life,
Defender
stopped to pick up survivors. The reappearance of the German cruiser
SMS
Stettin
caused two of her boats to be left behind. Their crews were lucky to be rescued by the British submarine
E4
. Short of space, the captain of
E4
embarked three German prisoners and supplied the boats with water, biscuits, a compass, and a course to steer, and they returned safely to base.
[6]
[7]
On 23 November 1914, the British battleships
Russell
and
Exmouth
bombarded the German-occupied Belgian port of
Zeebrugge
, which was being used as a base for German submarines.
Defender
was one of eight destroyers detached from the
Harwich Force
to reinforce the escort for the operation, joining six destroyers of the
Dover Patrol
and four French destroyers. The operation was unchallenged by the German defences, but little damage was done to the port.
[8]
Battle of Dogger Bank
[
edit
]
Defender
was present at the
Battle of Dogger Bank
on 24 January 1915 with the First Destroyer Flotilla, led by
the light cruiser
Aurora
.
[9]
Battle of Jutland
[
edit
]
A drawing of the damage sustained by
Defender
at Jutland
On the night of 31 May - 1 June 1916
Defender
took an active part in the
Battle of Jutland
, with the First Destroyer Flotilla operating in support of
Beatty
's
battlecruiser
force.
[10]
At about 18:30 she was struck in the forward boiler room by a single 12 inch (305 mm) shell, killing one man and wounding two. Although the shell failed to explode, it knocked out the boiler room, reducing the ship's speed to about 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph), forcing her out of formation with the rest of her Flotilla.
[11]
On restoring power (about 19:15) she took the damaged
Onslow
in tow and made
Aberdeen
the next day. Her captain,
Lieutenant Commander
L R Palmer received the
Distinguished Service Order
. The event was described in detail by
Rudyard Kipling
, in
Sea Warfare
under the heading
Towing Under Difficulties
. The report on the battle by
Admiral Beatty
stated that:
Defender
, whose speed had been reduced to 10 knots, while on the disengaged side of the battle cruisers, was struck by a shell which damaged her foremost boiler, but closed
Onslow
and took her in tow. Shells were falling all round them during this operation, which, however, was successfully accomplished. During the heavy weather of the ensuing night the tow parted twice, but was resecured. The two struggled on together until 1p.m. 1st June, when
Onslow
was transferred to tugs. I consider the performances of these two destroyers to be gallant in the extreme, and I am recommending Lieutenant-Commander J. C. Tovey of
Onslow
, and Lieutenant Commander Palmer of
Defender
, for special recognition...
—
Admiral David Beatty
[12]
Lieutenant Commander Palmer wrote after the battle that
Onslow
had signalled
Defender
with the following message:
We all Captain, officers and ship’s company thank you very much for your kind and most efficient assistance and wish you all possible luck and a long leave
—
Onslow
to
Defender
[13]
Defender
was transferred to the
3rd Battle Squadron
in 1916.
Friendly fire incident
[
edit
]
On 18 June 1918,
Defender
was operating in the
Strait of Otranto
with the destroyer
HMS
Nymphe
whe she became a target in a
friendly fire incident
. The
United States Navy
submarine chasers
USS
SC-95
,
USS
SC-151
, and
USS
SC-227
were on an
antisubmarine warfare
patrol in the
strait
when at 21:00 their
hydrophones
detected sounds that their crews assumed were coming from a
submarine
. They began following the sounds. The sounds grew louder at 22:40, and the submarine chaser crews concluded that they were approaching a surfaced submarine. All three submarine chasers went to
full speed
and soon sighted
Defender
and
Shaw
, which they identified merely as two low-lying objects. They challenged the destroyers by blinker light several times but received no answer, so they opened fire on what they believed were two surfaced enemy submarines,
SC-94
firing two rounds and
SC-151
one. One of
SC-94
′s shots struck
Nymphe
, cutting a steam line and put one of her
steam  engines
out of commission. Both destroyers immediately flashed lights, and the submarine chasers ceased fire and went alongside, discovering that their targets had been
Defender
and
Nymphe
.
Defender
took
Nymphe
under
tow
, and the submarine chasers resumed their patrol. A post-incident inquiry found that
Defender
and
Nymphe
had not responded to the recognition challenges of the submarine chasers because they had orders not to use recognition signals, a restriction of which the submarine chaser crews were unaware.
[14]
Disposal
[

]
Defender
was laid up and sold to Rees of Llanelly for breaking up on 4 November 1921.

Location, architecture and design
[
edit
]
Patna Secretariat is a mighty Victorian construction located to the east of the Raj Bhavan in Patna.
[2]
Built by the British in the Indo-Sarcenic style, it was completed in 1917.
[3]
It is 716 feet long 364 feet wide and remains one of the largest government buildings of the City. A huge clock tower stands tall amidst the beautiful and green lawn of the place.
[4]
Originally, it was 198 feet high, but a part of it fell down during the
1934 Nepal-Bihar earthquake
. Currently, its height is 184 feet from the ground. A four-foot gap left between the concrete ceiling and the outer covering of tiles from Raniganj ensures a reasonable temperature in the interiors during the hot season.
[5]
The campus has lawns and other remarkable things, such as bronze statue of the first
Chief Minister of Bihar
, Bihar Kesari
Srikrishna Sinha
to the west of Lawn and the
Martyr's memorial
to commemorate the sacrifice of seven students during 1942
August Kranti movement
.
Patna Secretariat Building is one of the remarkable buildings of the city of Patna, known for its architectural splendor. It was designed by the famous architect of
Sydney
, Joseph Munnings and built by
Martin Burn
of
Calcutta
during 1913-17.
[6]
It stands distinct from any other historical building of the city by its tall clock tower. Today, this is the Secretariat of
Bihar
State Government. It is a bustling center with all types of government activities.
[7]
All the important government departments, such as Home, Finance, General Administration, Cabinet Secretariat etc. are situated here so do the office of the ministers and the bureaucrats.

Victor Haim Perera
(1934 - 14 June 2003) was an author and journalist primarily concerned with
Latin America
and
Sephardic Jewry
. He was best known for his history of the Sephardic Jews,
The Cross and The Pear Tree
(1995), which traced the path of his own family from 15th-century Spain to 20th-century Guatemala.
[1]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Perera was born in
Guatemala
to Sephardic Jewish parents.
[2]
After the end of the Second World War, the family left an increasingly dangerous Guatemala for Brooklyn, New York. Perera studied at Brooklyn College, and went on to study English at the University of Michigan. There he met, and in 1960 married,
Padma Hejmadi
, an Indian writer/artist and Hindu. The marriage, which caused a rift in his family, broke down in 1972, and Perera moved to California. In his writing, he expressed his belief that his family was suffering under a curse for leaving Palestine two generations earlier.
[1]
[3]
[4]
After retiring, he co-founded Sephardic/Mizrahi Artists and Writers International, which sponsors the Sephardic arts.
[4]
In 1998 Perera suffered a severe stroke while swimming, and was largely forced to give up his writing. He had been working on a book about
whales
.
[1]
Writing career
[
edit
]
Perera's first job was as a fact-checker at
The New Yorker
. Working as a journalist, he also taught journalism for 20 years at the
University of California's
campuses at
Santa Cruz
and
Berkeley
. His numerous articles and essays were published by, among others,
The Atlantic
,
Harper's
,
The Nation
,
The New York Review of Books
, and
The New Yorker
.
[5]
His writing included ethnographic work as well. With the anthropologist Robert D. Bruce, he wrote
Last Lords of Palenque
(1982), a first-hand account of life among the
Lacandon Indians
. In
Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy
(1993), he collected oral accounts of the lives of modern
Mayans
, and of the murders of many of them by the country's army.
[3]
These books helped enhance his reputation as a voice for the oppressed.

The pagoda at
Yakushi-ji
, a
Buddhist temple
built during the Hakuhō period.
The
Hakuhō period
(
白鳳時代
,
Hakuhō jidai
, "white phoenix period")
was an unofficial
Japanese era name
(
年号
,
nengō
, "year name")
of
Emperor Tenmu
[1]
after
Hakuchi
[2]
and before
Suchō
.
[3]
The duration of this
discrete non-
nengō
timespan
lasted from 673 through 686.
[1]
The Hakuhō period is more often used as a general term which describes a wider range of years.
History of art
[
edit
]
Hakuhō is conventionally used to identify a broad historical and artistic period of the late seventh century and early eighth century.
[1]
The term is primarily used in art history and is thought to have been introduced at the 1910
Japan-British Exhibition
.
[4]
In general historical contexts, the
Asuka period
is understood as overlapping the Hakuhō period; and the Hakuhō can be construed as having been followed by a Tempyō period in art history.
[1]
The Hakuhō period was marked by the rapid expansion of
Buddhism
and its dissemination throughout Japan. Artistically the period was influenced directly by the
Sui
and
Tang
dynasties,
[4]
and influenced indirectly by
Gupta art
from India.
[1]
Beginning with the Taika Reforms, the period saw a shift towards more structured, more bureaucratic forms of government, based largely on Chinese models. The first "permanent" Imperial capital was established at
Fujiwara-kyō
in 694. Though the capital was moved again only sixteen years later, this represented an important step in the development of the
Yamato state
, the seat of power which had been quite transitory and nomadic up until this point.
[5]
The decades of the Hakuhō period also saw many other major developments in political structure and in culture, including the introduction of writing and the development of calligraphy in Japan. Chinese characters had been seen and used in Japan for centuries prior, but it was during the 7th century that, as one scholar describes it, "writing and the art of its production—or calligraphy—has a sudden and spectacular flowering".
[6]
Art and Architecture
[
edit
]
The term "Hakuhō period" is chiefly applied in discussions of architecture, sculpture, and painting.
Hundreds of
Buddhist temples
were built in the Hakuhō period, including
Kawara-dera
,
Daikandai-ji
, and
Yakushi-ji
in Fujiwara-kyō, in
styles
showing considerable
Tang-dynasty China
influence. Wakakusa-dera, which had burnt down in 670, was also rebuilt at this time as
Hōryū-ji
, showing the same stylistic influences.
[7]
[8]
When Baekje was ruined in 660, The refugee was naturalized in Japan. And they played a major role in designing and constructing these temples and taught and trained their Japanese counterparts.
At the time, stone and bronze were the chief media used for Buddhist statues in Japan, and would remain so on the continent for quite some time to come;
[9]
However, in Japan, the wood carved statues which would come to dominate in later centuries began to appear as early as the Hakuhō period.
Hōryū-ji
[
edit
]
The statues in Hōryū-ji serve as good examples of Hakuhō period sculpture; nearly all date to that period.
[10]
Most are made of wood, with a single block used for the bodies, and separate blocks for secondary elements, such as demons upon which the deity treads, halos, and parts of the deities' skirts. All were originally painted and gilded, and bear rounder forms with a stronger impact of three-dimensionality than the Asuka period statues of earlier decades. In these aspects and others, they reflect strong stylistic influences from
Three Kingdoms of Korea
,
Tang-dynasty
China, and from the stylistic heritage of the
Northern Qi
and
Sui
Dynasties which came before.
[10]
Another group of statues from the same temple show another important development, namely, the first use of lacquer not solely as a protective or decorative coating for statues, but as a material from which accessories, such as a
bodhisattva
's jewellery, hair ornaments, and hair, might be made, to be attached onto the wooden sculpture.
[10]
A series of mural paintings on the walls of the
kondō
("Golden Hall"; Main Hall) of Hōryū-ji, depicting various Buddhist figures, represent some of the best extant examples of Hakuhō period painting. Though a 1949 fire left most of the paintings blackened to the point of illegibility, the process can still be determined. Plaster was applied to the walls layer by layer, each layer increasingly fine. Once the plaster was dry, holes were punched in the preliminary sketches for the painting (known as a
cartoon
), and colored sand or powder was applied, passing through the holes and sticking to the surface of the wall, providing an outline or rough guideline for the painter to then follow. These Hōryū-ji murals represent two painting elements distinctive of this period: the use of red rather than black to outline the figures and, on other sections, a consistent line lacking calligraphic flourish and known as "iron wire" line.
[11]
Yakushi-ji
[
edit
]
Yakushi-ji was founded in the Hakuhō period
[4]
in 680.
[12]
A number of Buddhist statues at Yakushi-ji temple are counted among the finest extant examples of Hakuhō period sculpture, reflecting the influence of Tang Chinese styles more strongly than their counterparts in Hōryū-ji.
A noteworthy Yakushi Triad
(
薬師三尊
,
Yakushi sanzon
)
consists of three sculptures representing the
Yakushi
Buddha and two bodhisattvas
Nikkō
and
Gakkō
)
[13]
which are described as "full, fleshy figures conceived in the round and treated as completely natural forms".
[11]
These three figures were cast in bronze; and they were replaced in the
Edo period
after their destruction in earthquake or fire. The bodhisattvas are posed in the "hip-slung" (
Sanskrit
:
tribhanga
) pose and other Chinese motifs including grape leaves and the
Symbols of the Four Directions
are prevalent.

Status: Repealed
The
Mock Auctions Act 1961
(
9 & 10 Eliz. 2
. c. 47) was an
Act
of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
that regulated
mock auctions
. It was repealed by the
Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008
(SI 2008/1277).
Background
[
edit
]
Attempts to pass an Act regulating
mock auctions
started in 1928, with the Mock Auctions Bill introduced by
Lord Gorell
. The Bill failed after it was passed to a Select Committee, which reported that existing provisions were sufficient to deal with the problem. Opponents of the Bill argued that it would be impossible to secure convictions, since victims are reluctant to come forward and highlight their gullibility.
[1]
The second Mock Auctions Bill was introduced to Parliament by a group of MPs including
Norman Dodds
, and received
royal assent
on 27 July 1961.
[2]
[3]
Act
[
edit
]
To avoid interfering with genuine auctions, the Act includes a complex and detailed definition of a mock auction. A mock auction is an auction featuring competitive bidding which satisfies one of three tests:
if there is a reduction in price or repayment of the money to the highest bidder,
if the right to bid is restricted to people who have bought other items or
if any items are offered as gifts or given away.
[4]
The punishment for running a mock auction, if convicted, was at most either a £1,000 fine, two years in prison or both.

Daredevil
is a fictional
superhero
created by
Jack Binder
, who starred in comics from
Lev Gleason Publications
during the 1930s-1940s period historians and fans call the
Golden Age of comic books
before being retroactively established into the
Image Universe
by
Image Comics
in the 1990s as its first character. The character is unrelated to
Marvel Comics
'
Daredevil
, and recent renditions of the character have often renamed him to avoid confusion and potential lawsuits.
As a child,
Bart Hill
had been rendered mute by the shock of seeing his father murdered and himself being branded with a hot iron. Orphaned, he grew up to become a
boomerang
marksman, in homage to the boomerang-shaped scar left on his chest. Like
Batman
, introduced a year earlier, he took up a costume to wage vigilante vengeance.
[2]
Editor
Jack Cole
, who would create the classic
Plastic Man
a year later, revamped the character in the next issue as
Bill Hart
, pitting him against
Silver Streak
'
s lead character, the villainous
Claw
, for a five-issue battle that made Daredevil a star.

Publication history
[
edit
]
Lev Gleason Publications
[
edit
]
This original Daredevil was created by
Jack Binder
for an eight-page backup feature in Lev Gleason Publications'
Silver Streak Comics
#6 (Sept. 1940).
[4]
Upon his partial revamping in the issue following his debut, only Hill's identity, spiked belt, and the boomerang remained; the mute angle was dropped without explanation, and his original symmetrically divided bodysuit of pale yellow and dark blue was redesigned to a dark red and blue.
[5]
The final installment was written by
Don Rico
, who would write the character through
Silver Streak
#17 (Dec. 1941).
Daredevil Battles Hitler
(July 1941), the premiere issue of
Daredevil Comics
; art by
Charles Biro
and
Bob Wood
.
By this time, publisher Lev Gleason had already launched Daredevil's own comic with
Daredevil Battles
Hitler
#1 (July 1941), in which Daredevil and other
Silver Streak
heroes fought the German chancellor.
[6]
As with
Captain America Comics
#1 (March 1941), in which Hitler also gets an ignominious sock in the jaw, the comic anticipated U.S. involvement in
World War II
. It was written and partially drawn by
Charles Biro
, who continued on the book when its title changed to
Daredevil Comics
with issue #2, and who in his 16-year run would make the character one of the most acclaimed of the Golden Age.
[7]
Biro rewrote Daredevil's origin in issue #18 (August 1943), now depicting Daredevil's real identity, Bart Hill, as having been raised by
aborigines
in the
Australian Outback
.
According to
Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes
, "his arch-enemy is
the Claw
, but there are Nazis to be fought, mad scientists, the Deadly Dozen, Wolf Carson (a wolf with a human brain), the Ghoul, Reve Venge (the Phantom of Notre Dame), and Crepto, the imbecile with the strength of fifteen men".
[8]
Biro introduced popular supporting characters the
Little Wise Guys
in
Daredevil
#13 (Oct. 1942). A "kid gang" similar to
DC Comics
'
Newsboy Legion
and many others, the group consisted of Curly, Jocko, Peewee, Scarecrow, and Meatball - the last of whom, with remarkable daring, was killed two issues later. By the late 1940s, with
superheroes
going out of fashion, the Little Wise Guys took center stage, edging out Daredevil altogether with issue #70 (Jan. 1950).
[9]
The series lasted through #134 (Sept. 1956).

Daredevil is one of several
public domain
Golden Age characters to appear in
Image Comics
'
Next Issue Project
, spearheaded by Image's
Erik Larsen
, returning to
Silver Streak
, the book which introduced him to the public.
Daredevil also appeared in issue #141 of Larsen's
Savage Dragon
comic series. That issue served to resurrect a slew of public domain Golden Age characters.
Savage Dragon
#148 debuted
The Dynamic Daredevil
as a regular supporting cast member in the series. That issue also brought back the Little Wise Guys. Daredevil becomes deeply involved in the problems of Dragon's ravaged Chicago; he becomes severely injured battling a murderous version of Dragon.
[10]
In 2021,
the Dynamic Daredevil
appeared as supporting character in a new
Ant
comic series, which was published in June, written and drawn by Larsen.

Other publishers
[

Daredevil is now in the
public domain
, and as a result many publishers have used him to varying degrees, most opting to make name changes in an effort to have something to own and to get around Marvel's Daredevil trademark.
AC Comics
[
edit

In the late 1980s,
AC Comics
revived Daredevil as part of that publisher's superhero universe. Renamed
Reddevil
,
[13]
[14]
he appeared as a guest character in
Femforce
#45 and #50
[15]
[16]
before starring in the
one-shot
title

Daredevil was one of the many Golden Age heroes who showed up in
Roy Thomas
'
Alter Ego
mini-series. He is renamed as
Doubledare
.
Dynamite Entertainment
[
edit
]
A variation on Daredevil appeared in the comic-book series
Project Superpowers
, by writer
Jim Krueger
and artist
Alex Ross
.
[18]
In this series, he is billed and trademarked as
The Death-Defying 'Devil
.
[19]
In 2008,
Dynamite Entertainment
spun off a solo miniseries for the character, written by
Joe Casey
with art by Edgar Salazar.
[20]
In this series, someone from 'Devil's past - wearing a green version of 'Devil's costume and calling himself "Dragon" - believes that the returned hero is an impostor, and is determined to expose him. The Dragon turns out to be Curly, who reveals that the actual 'Devil died in 1987.
[21]
Within the main series itself, the 'Devil is eventually revealed to be Bart Hill's costume, which had in fact always been sentient and was placed in the urn along with a single boomerang as part of a pact between Hill and the Fighting Yank. The costume does not explicitly reveal its nature to its allies, but eventually discards its pretense of being human by handing the Black Terror the dentures it had been using to create the illusion of a mouth. It possesses additional powers, such as the ability to grow new spike-like branches and the knowledge of an ancient language needed to banish the Claw, and is implied to have its own, sinister agenda.

Legacy
[
edit

In homage to the Golden Age Daredevil, Marvel Comics' Daredevil would wear a similar costume in the alternate-reality
Mutant X
series in
Mutant X Annual 2001
. In addition, the 2000
Marvels Comics: Daredevil
special had a group based on the Little Wise Guys. A similar, earlier homage came in
DC Comics
'
Kingdom Come
series, when
Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt
- a character whose regular costume was inspired by Daredevil's, according to creator
Pete Morisi
[22]
- wore a new costume very similar to that of the Golden Age Daredevil.
Film
[
edit
]
Bart Hill appears alongside other Golden Age superheroes in the independent film
Avenging Force: The Scarab
, where he's renamed as Doubledare possibly in order to avoid copyright issues with Marvel's Daredevil.

Marasmius sasicola
is a species of
Marasmiaceae
fungus known from
Kanagawa Prefecture
, Japan. First collected in 2000, it was
described
in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white
caps
and very short, very thin black
stems
. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread out around the cap, and all of them reach the stem. The
flesh
has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead
Sasa
leaves, from which it takes its
specific epithet
.
Taxonomy and naming
[
edit
]
Marasmius sasicola
was first
described
by Haruki Takahashi (2002) in an article in
Mycoscience
, based on specimens collected from Ikuta Ryokuchi Park,
Kawasaki
,
Kanagawa Prefecture
, Japan in 2000 and 2001. The
specific name
sasicola
refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of
Sasa
species. The Japanese
common name
for the species is
Sasa-no-houraitake
. Within the genus
Mycena
, it probably belongs to the
section
Marasmius
, and the
subsection
Penicillati
, due to characters of the
stem
,
gills
and
pileipellis
(the outer-most layer of the
cap
).
[2]
Description
[
edit
]
Marasmius sasicola
produces mushrooms that have convex caps from 5 to 10 millimetres (0.2 to 0.4 in) in diameter featuring folds or striations. The caps do not expand or flatten with age, and are dry and dull. The cap surface is covered in tiny grains which vanish as the mushrooms age. The caps of young mushrooms are coloured light brown, but paler at the cap margin; as they mature, the caps become paler, approaching white when fully matured. The very thin, smooth
stem
measures between 2 and 3 mm (0.08 and 0.1 in) in length by 0.3 to 0.4 mm (0.01 to 0.02 in) thick. It connects to the centre of the cap, and is a dark brown to black colour.
Mycelial cords
cannot be seen at the base of the stem, which anchors itself into the
substrate
. The white
gills
can be adnexed (attaching to the stem by only part of their depth) to adnate (attaching by their full depth). They are not at all crowded, with between 6 and 8 separate gills, all of which reach the stem. Each gill is up to 2 mm (0.08 in) broad, though it is thinner at the edge. The mushrooms have a very thin layer of whitish
flesh
up to 0.4 mm (0.02 in) thick. The tough but flexible flesh lacks any odour or taste.
[2]
Microscopic characteristics
[
edit
]
Marasmius sasicola
produces colourless, ellipsoid
basidiospores
of between 8 and 10 by 4 to 6
micrometres
(μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not
amyloid
and have thin
cell walls
. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any
basidia
, but he did describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10 μm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia (
cystidia
on the edge of the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The
pileipellis
, the top layer of the cap, forms a
hymeniderm
, a cell structure reminiscent of the
hymenium
on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10 μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1 μm thick. The
stipitipellis
, the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6 μm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1 μm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have
clamp connections
.
[2]
The flesh in the cap is made up of irregularly arranged cylindrical
hyphae
from 5 to 15 μm wide. They stain a dark reddish-brown in
Melzer's reagent
or
Lugol's solution
. The flesh in the stem is made up of hyphae which run down the stem and measure 4 to 11 μm in thickness. The smooth cell walls are colorless, but again stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The septa have clamp connections.
[2]
Similar species
[
edit
]
Marasmius subconiatus
, known from Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is somewhat similar to
M. sasicola
. It can be differentiated as its stem does not enter the substrate, and the gills differ. In
M. subconiatus
, the gills are orange, and sport cheilocystidia which are pale yellow.
[2]
Habitat and distribution
[
edit
]
Marasmius sasicola
is known from the lowland forests of
Kanagawa Prefecture
, Japan, and can be found in June. Mushrooms grow in large numbers close together, and grow from dead leaves of
Sasa
(grass bamboo) which have fallen.

Term used to describe anti-theatrical sentiments
Royalty Theatre, London - changing fashions
Antitheatricality
is any form of opposition or hostility to
theater
. Such opposition is as old as theater itself,
[
citation needed
]
suggesting a deep-seated ambivalence in human nature about the dramatic arts. Jonas Barish's 1981 book,
The Antitheatrical Prejudice
, was, according to one of his
Berkeley
colleagues, immediately recognized as having given intellectual and historical definition to a phenomenon which up to that point had been only dimly observed and understood. The book earned the American Theater Association's Barnard Hewitt Award for outstanding research in theater history.
[1]
Barish and some more recent commentators treat the anti-theatrical, not as an enemy to be overcome, but rather as an inevitable and valuable part of the theatrical dynamic.
Antitheatrical views have been based on philosophy, religion, morality, psychology, aesthetics and on simple prejudice. Opinions have focussed variously on the art form, the artistic content, the players, the lifestyle of theater people, and on the influence of theater on the behaviour and morals of individuals and society. Anti-theatrical sentiments have been expressed by government legislation, philosophers, artists, playwrights, religious representatives, communities, classes, and individuals.
The earliest documented objections to theatrical performance were made by Plato around 380 B.C. and re-emerged in various forms over the following 2,500 years. Plato's philosophical objection was that theatrical performance was inherently distanced from reality and therefore unworthy. Church leaders would rework this argument in a theological context. A later aesthetic variation, which led to closet drama, valued the play, but only as a book. From Victorian times, critics complained that self-aggrandizing actors and lavish stage settings were getting in the way of the play.
Plato's moral objections were echoed widely in Roman times, leading eventually to theater's decline. During the Middle Ages, theatrical performance gradually re-emerged, the mystery plays accepted as part of church life. From the 16th century onwards, once theater was re-established as an independent profession, concerns were regularly raised that the acting community was inherently corrupt and that acting had a destructive moral influence on both actors and audiences. These views were often expressed during the emergence of Protestant, Puritan and Evangelical movements.
Plato and ancient Greece
[
edit
]
Plato, theater's first critic
Athens
[
edit
]
Around 400 B.C. the importance of
Greek drama
to
ancient Greek culture
was expressed by
Aristophanes
in his play,
The Frogs
,
where the chorus leader says, "There is no function more noble than that of the god-touched Chorus teaching the city in song".
[2]
Theater and religious festivals were intimately connected.
Around 380 B.C.
Plato
became the first to challenge theater in the ancient world. Although his views expressed in
The Republic
were radical, they were aimed primarily at the concept of theater (and other mimetic arts). He did not encourage hostility towards the artists or their performances. For Plato, theater was philosophically undesirable, it was simply a lie. It was bad for society because it engaged the sympathies of the audience and so might make people less thoughtful. Furthermore, the representation of ignoble actions on the stage could lead the actors and the audience to behave badly themselves.
[3]
Mimesis
[
edit
]
See also:
Mimesis
Philosophically, acting is a special case of
mimesis
(μίμησις), which is the correspondence of art to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, truth, and the good. Plato explains this by using an illustration of an everyday object. First there is a universal truth, for example, the abstract concept of a bed. The carpenter who makes the bed creates an imperfect
imitation
of that concept in wood. The artist who paints a picture of the bed is making an imperfect
imitation
of the wooden bed. The artist is therefore several stages away from true reality and this is an undesirable state. Theater is likewise several stages from reality and therefore unworthy. The written words of a play can be considered more worthy since they can be understood directly by the mind and without the inevitable distortion caused by intermediaries.
Psychologically, mimesis is considered as formative, shaping the mind and causing the actor to become more like the person or object imitated. Actors should therefore only imitate people very much like themselves and then only when aspiring to virtue and avoiding anything base. Furthermore, they must not imitate women, or slaves, or villains, or madmen, or 'smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, boatswains, or the like'.
Aristotle
[
edit
]
In
The
Poetics
(Περὶ ποιητικῆς) c. 335 BC, Aristotle argues against Plato’s objections to
mimesis
, supporting the concept of
catharsis
(cleansing) and affirms the human drive to imitate. Frequently, the term that Aristotle uses for ‘actor’ is
prattontes
, suggesting
praxis
or real action, as opposed to Plato’s use of
hypocrites
(ὑποκριτής) which suggests one who 'hides under a mask', is deceptive or expresses make-believe emotions. Aristotle wants to avoid the hypothetical consequence of Plato’s critique, namely the closing of theaters and the banishment of actors. Ultimately Aristotle’s attitude is ambivalent; he concedes that drama should be able to exist without actually being acted.
[4]
Plutarch
[
edit
]
The
Moralia
of
Plutarch
, written in the first century, contain an essay (often given the title,
Were the Athenians More Famous in War or in Wisdom?
) which reflects many of Plato's critical views but in a less nuanced way. Plutarch wonders what it tells us about the audience in that we take pleasure in watching an actor express strongly negative emotions on stage, whereas in real life, the opposite would be true.

Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity
[
edit
]
Rome
[
edit
]
Unlike Greece, theatre in Rome was distanced from religion and was largely led by professional actor-managers.  From early days the acting profession was marginalised and, by the height of the
Roman Empire
, considered thoroughly disreputable. In the first century A.D.,
Cicero
declared, "dramatic art and the theatre is generally disgraceful". During this time, permanent theater-building was forbidden and other popular entertainments often took theater's place. Actors, who were mainly foreigners, freedmen and slaves, had become a disenfranchised class. They were forbidden to leave the profession and were required to pass their employment on to their children.
Mimes
included female performers, were heavily sexual in nature and often equated with
prostitution
. Attendance at such performances, says Barish, must have seemed to many Romans like visiting the brothels, "equally urgent, equally provocative of guilt, and hence equally in need of being scourged by a savage backlash of official disapproval".
[5]
: 38-43
Christian attitudes
[
edit
]
Early Christian leaders, concerned to promote high ethical principles amongst the growing Christian community, were naturally opposed to the degenerate nature of contemporary Roman theatre. However, other arguments were also advanced.
Tertullian, second century Christian teacher and critic of theater
In the second century,
Tatian
and later
Tertullian
, put forward
ascetic
principles. In
De spectaculis
, Tertullian argued that even moderate pleasure is to be avoided and that theater, with its large crowds and deliberately exciting performances, led to "mindless absorption in the imaginary fortunes of nonexistent characters". Absorbing Plato’s concept of mimesis into a Christian context, he also argued that acting was an ever-increasing system of falsifications. "First the actor falsifies his identity, and so compounds a deadly sin. If he impersonates someone vicious, he further compounds the sin." And if physical modification was required, say a man representing a woman, it was a "lie against our own faces, and an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator".
[5]
: 44-49
In the fourth century, the famous preacher
Chrysostom
again stressed the ascetic theme. It was not pleasure but the opposite of pleasure that brought salvation. He wrote that "he who converses of theatres and actors does not benefit [his soul], but inflames it more, and renders it more careless... He who converses about hell incurs no dangers, and renders it more sober."
[5]
: 51
Augustine of Hippo
, his North African contemporary, had in early life led a hedonistic lifestyle which changed dramatically following his conversion. In his
Confessions
,
echoing Plato, he says about imitating others: "To the end that we may be true to our nature, we should not become false by copying and likening to the nature of another, as do the actors and the reflections in the mirror ... We should instead seek that truth which is not self-contradictory and two-faced."
[5]
: 57, 58
Augustine also challenged the cult of personality, maintaining that hero worship was a form of idolatry in which adulation of actors replaced the worship of God, leading people to miss their true happiness.
"For in the theatre, dens of iniquity though they may be, if a man is fond of a particular actor, and enjoys his art as a great or even as the very greatest good, he is fond of all who join with him in admiration of his favorite, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of him whom they admire in common; and the more fervent he is in his admiration, the more he works in every way he can to secure new admirers for him, and the more anxious he becomes to show him to others; and if he find anyone comparatively indifferent, he does all he can to excite his interest by urging his favorite's merits. If, however, he meet with anyone who opposes him, he is exceedingly displeased by such a man's contempt of his favorite, and strives in every way he can to remove it. Now, if this be so, what does it become us to do who live in the fellowship of the love of God, the enjoyment of whom is the true happiness of life...?"
Theatre and church in the Middle Ages
[
edit
]
Engraving depicting an early Chester mystery play
Around AD 470, as Rome declined, the Roman Church increased in power and influence, and theater was virtually eliminated.
[6]
In the Middle Ages, theatrical performance re-emerged as part of church life, telling Bible stories in a dramatic way; the aims of the church and of theater had now converged and there was very little opposition..
One of the few surviving examples of anti-theatrical attitude is found in
A Treatise of Miraclis Pleyinge,
a fourteenth-century sermon by an anonymous preacher. The sermon is generally agreed to be of
Lollard
inspiration. It is not clear if the text refers to the performance of
mystery plays
on the streets or to
liturgical drama
in the church. Possibly the author makes no distinction. Barish traces the basis of the preacher's prejudice to the lifelike immediacy of the theater, which sets it in unwelcome competition to everyday life and to the doctrines held in schools and churches. The preacher declares that since a play's basic objective is to please, its purpose must be suspect because
Christ
never laughed. If one laughs or cries at a play it is because of the "pathos of the story". One's expression of emotion is therefore useless in the eyes of God. The playmaking itself is at fault. "It is the concerted, organized, professionalized nature of the enterprise that offends so deeply, the fact that it entails planning and teamwork and elaborate preparation, making it different from the kind of sin that is committed inadvertently, or in a fit of ungovernable passion."

16th and 17th century English theatre

Thomas Becon c. 1511-1567, early Protestant critic of the theatricality of the Mass
Theatricality in the church
[
edit
]
In 1559,
Thomas Becon
, an English priest, wrote
The Displaying of the Popish Mass
, an early expression of emerging Protestant theology, while in
exile
during the reign of
Queen Mary
.
[7]
His argument was with the Church and the ritualised theatricality of the mass. "By introducing ceremonial costume, ritual gesture, and symbolic decor, and by separating the clergy from the laity, the church has perverted a simple communal event into a portentous masquerade, a magic show designed to hoodwink the ignorant." He believed that in a mass with too much pomp, the laity became passive spectators, entertained in a production that became a substitute for the message of God.

English Renaissance theatre
The first English theatres were not built until the last quarter of the 16th century. One in eight Londoners regularly watched performances of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson and others, an attendance rate only matched since by cinema around 1925-1939.
[8]
Objections were made, to
live performances
rather than to dramatic work itself or to its writers,
[9]
and some objectors made an explicit exception for
closet dramas
, especially those that were religious or had religious content.
[10]
Ben Jonson, 1730, playwright and challenger of theatrical conventions
Variations of Plato's reasoning on mimesis re-emerged.  One problem was the representation of rulers and the high-born by those of low birth.
[11]
Another issue was that of
effeminization
in the
boy player
when he took on female clothing and gesture. Both
Ben Jonson
and
Shakespeare
used cross-dressing as significant themes within their plays, and Laura Levine (1994) explores this issue in
Men in Women's Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization, 1579-1642.
In 1597
Stephen Gosson
said that theatre "effeminized" the mind, and four years later
Philip Stubbes

William Prynne - author of Histriomastix (1633) a culmination of the Puritan attack on English theatre
William Prynne's encyclopedic
Histriomastix
:
The Player's Scourge, or Actor's Tragedy
,
represents the culmination of the Puritan attack on English Renaissance theatre and on celebrations such as
Christmas
, the latter alleged to have been derived from pagan Roman festivals. Although a particularly acute and comprehensive attack which emphasised spiritual and moral objections, it represented a common anti-theatrical view held by many during this time.
Prynne's outstanding objection to theater was that it encouraged pleasure and recreation over work, and that its excitement and effeminacy increased sexual desire.
[5]
: 83-85, 88
Published in 1633, the
Histriomastix
scourged many types of theater in broad, repetitious, and fiery ways. The title page reads:
"Histrio-mastix. The players scourge, or, actors tragædie, divided into two parts. Wherein it is largely evidenced, by divers arguments, by the concurring authorities and resolutions of sundry texts of Scripture, that popular stage-playes are sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable mischiefes to churches, to republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men. And that the profession of play-poets, of stage-players; together with the penning, acting, and frequenting of stage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous and misbeseeming Christians. All pretences to the contrary are here likewise fully answered; and the unlawfulnes of acting, of beholding academicall enterludes, briefly discussed; besides sundry other particulars concerning dancing, dicing, health-drinking, &c. of which the table will informe you."

Main article:
1642 London theatre closure
By 1642, the Puritan view prevailed. As the
First English Civil War
got underway, London theaters were closed down.  The order cited the current "times of humiliation" and their incompatibility with "public stage-plays", representative of "lascivious Mirth and Levity".
[16]
After the
Restoration
of the monarchy in 1660, the performance of plays was again allowed. Under a new licensing system, two London theatres with royal patents were opened.

Restoration theatre
[

See also:
Restoration comedy
Aphra Behn Restoration playwright
Initially, the theatres performed many of the plays of the previous era, though often in adapted forms, but soon, new genres of
Restoration comedy
and
Restoration spectacular
evolved. A Royal Warrant from
Charles II
, who loved the theatre, brought English women onto the stage for the first time, putting an end to the practice of the 'boy player' and creating an opportunity for actresses to take on 'breeches' roles. This, says historian Antonia Fraser, meant that Nell Gwynn, Peg Hughes and others could show off their pretty legs in shows more titillating than ever before.
[18]
Historian
George Clark
(1956) said the best-known fact about Restoration drama was that it was immoral. The dramatists mocked at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper. "The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it."
[19]
Antonia Fraser (1984) took a more relaxed approach, describing the Restoration as a liberal or permissive era.
[20]
The satirist, Tom Brown (1719) wrote, 'tis as hard a matter for a pretty Woman to keep herself honest in a Theatre as 'tis for an Apothecary to keep his treacle from the Flies in Hot Weather, for every Libertine in the Audience will be buzzing about her Honey-Pot...'
[21]
The Restoration ushered in the first appearance of the casting couch in English social history. Most actresses were poorly paid and needed to supplement their income in other ways. Of the eighty women who appeared on the Restoration stage, twelve enjoyed an ongoing reputation as courtesans, being maintained by rich admirers of rank (including the King); at least another twelve left the stage to become 'kept women' or prostitutes. It was generally assumed that thirty of the women who had brief stage careers came from the brothels and had later returned to them. About a quarter of the actresses were considered to live respectable lives, most being married to fellow actors.
[22]
Fraser reports that 'by the 1670s a respectable woman could not give her profession as "Actoress" and expect to keep either her reputation or her person intact...  The word actress had secured in England that raffish connotation which would linger round it, for better or for worse, in fiction as well as in fact, for the next 250 years.'
[23]
17th century Europe
[
edit

Jansenism was the moral adversary to the theater in
France
, and in that respect similar to Puritanism in England. However, Barish argues, "the debate in France proceeds on an altogether more analytical, more intellectually responsible plane. The antagonists attend more carefully to the business of argument and the rules of logic; they indulge less in digression and anecdote."
[5]
: 193
Jansenism
[
edit
]
Jansenists
, rather like the Calvinists, denied the freedom of human will stating that "man can do nothing—could not so much as obey the ten commandments—without an express interposition of grace, and when grace came, its force was irresistible". Pleasure was forbidden because it became addictive.
[5]
: 200-201
According to
Pierre Nicole
, a distinguished Jansenist, the moral objection was, not so much about the makers of theater, or about the vice-den of the theater-space itself, or about the disorder it is presumed to cause, but rather about the intrinsically corrupting content. When an actor expresses base actions such as lust, hate, greed, vengeance, and despair, he must draw upon something immoral and unworthy in his own soul. Even positive emotions must be recognised as mere lies performed by
hypocrites
. The concern was a psychological one for, by experiencing these things, the actor stirs up heightened, temporal emotions, both in himself and in the audience, emotions that need to be denied. Therefore, both the actor and audience should feel ashamed for their collective participation.

wrote about the innate manners we were all born with and "when we copy others, we forsake what is authentic to us and sacrifice our own strong points for alien ones that may not suit us at all". By imitating others, including the good, all things are reduced to ideas and caricatures of themselves. Even with the intent of betterment, imitation leads directly to confusion. Mimesis ought therefore to be abandoned entirely.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau
Rousseau
[

Jean-Jacques Rousseau
, the Genevan philosopher, held the primary belief that all men were created good and that it was society that attempted to corrupt. Luxurious things were primarily to blame for these moral corruptions and, as stated in his
Discourse on the Arts
,
Discourse on the Origins of Inequality
and
Letter to d'Alembert
, the theater was central to this downfall. Rousseau argued for a nobler, simpler life free of the "perpetual charade of illusion, created by self-interest and self-love".The use of women in theater was disturbing for Rousseau; he believed women were designed by nature especially for modest roles and not for those of an actress. "The new society is not in fact to be encouraged to evolve its own morality but to revert to an earlier one, to the paradisal time when men were hardy and virtuous, women housebound and obedient, young girls chaste and innocent. In such a reversion, the theater—with all it symbolizes of the hatefulness of society, its hypocrisies, its rancid politeness, its heartless masqueradings—has no place at all."

Anti-theatrical pamphlet by Jeremy Collier (1698) an expression of post-Restoration views
18th century

By the end of the 17th century, the moral pendulum had swung back. Contributory factors included the
Glorious Revolution
of 1688,
William
and
Mary
's dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the
Society for the Reformation of Manners
(founded in 1692). When
Jeremy Collier
attacked playwrights like
Congreve
and
Vanbrugh
in his
Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage
in 1698, accusing them of profanity, blasphemy, indecency, and undermining public morality through the sympathetic depiction of vice, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.
Censorship
[
edit
]
Censorship of stage plays had been exercised by the
Master of the Revels
in England from
Elizabethan times
until the
order
closing theatres in 1642, closure remaining until the Restoration in 1660. In 1737, a pivotal moment in theatrical history, Parliament enacted the
Licensing Act
, a law to censor plays on the basis of both politics and morals (sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). It also limited spoken drama to the two patent theatres. Plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain.  Parts of these law were enforced unevenly. The act was modified by the
Theatres Act 1843
, which led later to the building of many new theatres across the country. Censorship was only finally abolished by the
Theatres Act
in 1968. (As the new medium of film developed in the 20th Century, the 1909
Cinematograph Act
was passed. Initially a health and safety measure, its implementation soon included censorship. In time the
British Board of Film Classification
became the
de facto
film censor
for films in the United Kingdom.)
Early America
[
edit
]
In 1778, just two years after declaring the United States as a nation, a law was passed to abolish theater,
gambling
,
horse racing
, and
cockfighting
, all on the grounds of their sinful nature. This forced theatrical practice into the American universities where it is also met with hostility, particularly from
Timothy Dwight IV
of
Yale University
and
John Witherspoon
of
Princeton College
.
[5]
: 296
The latter, in his work,
Serious Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Stage
,
[25]
outlined arguments similar to those of his predecessors, but added a further moral argument that as theater was truthful to life, it was therefore an improper method of instruction. "Now are not the great majority of characters in real life bad? Must not the greatest part of those represented on the stage be bad? And therefore, must not the strong impression which they make upon the spectators be hurtful in the same proportion?"
[5]
: 297
In her 1832 book
Domestic Manners of the Americans
, English writer
Fanny Trollope
noted how poorly attended theaters were in the American cities she visited, observing that women in particular "are rarely seen there, and by far the larger proportion of females deem it an offence against religion to witness the representation of a play."
[26]
After delivering the eulogy at the 1865 funeral of Abraham Lincoln,
Phineas Gurley
commented:
It will always be a matter of deep regret to thousands that our lamented President fell in the theater; that the dastardly assassin found him, shot him there. Multitudes of his best friends - I mean his Christian friends - would have preferred that he should have fallen in almost any other place. Had he been murdered in his bed, or in his office, or on the street, or on the steps of the Capitol, the tidings of his death would not have struck the Christian heart of the country quite so painfully; for the feeling of that heart is that the theater is one of the last places to which a good man should go and among the very last in which his friends would wish him to die.
[27]
William Wilberforce
[
edit
]
William Wilberforce (1790) politician, anti-slavery leader, and advocate for evangelical Christianity
William Wilberforce
, a renowned English politician, had been a theatre-goer in his youth but, following an evangelical conversion while a
Member of Parliament
, gradually changed his attitudes, his behaviour and his lifestyle.
[28]
Most notably, he became a prime leader of the movement to stop the
slave trade
. The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals and Methodists in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.
[29]
Wilberforce expressed his views on authentic faith in
A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians, in the Middle and Higher Classes in this Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity
(1797).
[30]
Barish summarises Wilberforce's description of contemporary theatre as 'a place haunted by debauchees bent on gratifying their appetites, from which modesty and regularity had retreated, while riots and lewdness were invited to the spot where God's name was profaned, and the only lessons to be learned were those Christians should shun like the pains of hell.'
[5]
: 303
The general tone of Wilberforce's argument is less contentious than Barish's summary would suggest and is only a small part of a wider call towards a true godliness. Wilberforce approaches theatricals tentatively, 'I am well aware that I am now about to tread on very tender ground; but it would be an improper deference to the opinions and manners of the age altogether to avoid it. There has been much argument concerning the lawfulness of theatrical amusements'.
[30]
: 202
Wilberforce also urged potential playgoers to consider the destructive impact of theatre on the moral and spiritual welfare of vulnerable actors.
[30]
: 209
Biographer and politician,
William Hague
, says of Wilberforce,
[31]
His ambitious and energetic promotion of his views may well have contributed to the changed social conventions which dominated the Victorian age after his death, creating a British society very different from the licentious London against which he had revolted in the 1780s. As one of the ‘Fathers of the Victorians’ his views once again seem dated when seen from the vantage point of the more relaxed morality of later times, but in relation to his basic view that the long-term happiness of a society depends on how individuals behave towards each other, how families hold together, and how leaders keep the trust of people, who can say with confidence that he was wrong?
19th and early 20th century (psychomachia)
[
edit
]
As theatre grew, so also did theatre-based anti-theatricality. Barish comments that from our present vantage point, nineteenth-century attacks on theater frequently have the air of a
psychomachia
, that is, a dramatic expression of the battle of
good versus evil
.
[5]
: 328-349
"The artistic conscience, struggling against the grossness of the physical stage, striving to free itself from the despotism of the actors, resembles the spirit warring against the flesh, the soul wrestling with the body, or the virtues launching their assault on the vices. But the persistence of the struggle seems to suggest that it is more than a temporary skirmish: it reflects an abiding tension in our natures as social beings."
Art versus theatre
[

Charles Lamb, Romantic writer and advocate of closet theatre
Various notables including
Lord Byron
,
Victor Hugo
,
Konstantin Stanislavsky
,
the actress Eleonora Duse
,
Giuseppe Verdi
, and
George Bernard Shaw
, regarded the uncontrollable narcissism of
Edmund Kean
and those like him with despair. They were appalled by the self-regarding mania that the theatre induced in those whose lot it was to parade, night after night, before crowds of clamorous admirers. Playwrights found themselves driven towards closet drama, just to avoid the corruption of their work by self-aggrandizing actors.
For Romantic writers such as
Charles Lamb
, totally devoted to
Shakespeare
, stage performances inevitably sullied the beauty and integrity of the original work which the mind alone could appreciate. The fault of the theater lay in its superficiality. The delicacy of the written word was crushed by histrionic actors and distracting scenic effects.
[5]
: 326-9
In his essay
On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation
, Lamb states that "all those delicacies which are so delightful in the reading...are sullied and turned from their very nature".
[32]
Utopian philosopher
Auguste Comte
, although a keen theater-goer, like Plato, banned all theater from his idealist society. Theater was a "concession to our weakness, a symptom of our irrationality, a kind of placebo of the spirit with which the good society will be able to dispense".
[5]
: 323
The advent of
Modernism
would lead to a completely fresh and trenchant anti-theatricalism, beginning with attacks on
Wagner
who could be considered the 'inventor' of
avant-garde
theatricalism. Wagner became the object of Modernism's most polemic anti-theatrical attackers.
Martin Puchner
states that Wagner, 'almost like a stage diva himself, continues to stand for everything that may be grandiose and compelling, but also dangerous and objectionable, about the theatre and theatricality.' Critics have included
Friedrich Nietzsche
,
Walter Benjamin
and
Michael Fried
. Puchner argues that 'No longer interested in banishing actors or closing down theaters, modernist anti-theatricalism does not remain external to the theater but instead becomes a productive force responsible for the theater's most glorious achievements'.
[4]
Eileen Fisher (1982), describes the anti-theatrical as "spats, self criticism from theater practitioners and fine critics. Such 'prejudices' are usually based upon aesthetic dismay at our theaters' rampant commercialism, general triteness, boring star-system, narcissism, and overreliance on Broadway-style spectacle and razzmatazz."
[33]
Church versus theatre
[
edit
]
'Psychomachia' applies even more to the battle of Church versus Stage. The Scottish Presbyterian Church's exertions concerning Kean were more overtly focussed on the spiritual battle. The English newspaper,
The Era
, sometimes known as the
Actor's Bible,
reported:
[34]
"It is well-known that the Kirk of Scotland, strict, if not somewhat stern in its observances, is utterly opposed to all theatrical exhibitions; in fact, amusement of any kind is in direct opposition to the gloomy Calvinistic tenets on which the Presbyterian Kirk is based. Kean's arrival in Edinburgh made a great stir [c.1820]. In Auld Reekie, the more rigid viewed his coming with anything but pleasure. Many really pious and well-meaning teachers of the word were very strenuous in their exertions to prevent their flocks being contaminated by a visit under such strong temptations. A certain clergyman was extremely anxious to prevent any collision between the lambs of the elect and the children of Satan, as he conscientiously believed his followers and the Corps Dramatique to be, and earnestly cautioned the major part of his flock, particularly his own family, not to go near the theatre."
In 1860, the report of a sermon, a now occasional but still ferocious attack on the morality of the theatre, was submitted to
The Era
by an actor, S. Price:
"Sir, knowing your valuable paper to be the only medium through which the 'poor player' can defend himself and his honest calling against the bigotry, slander, and unchristian misrepresentations of certain reverend mawworms who occasionally attack the Drama and its expounders, I venture to forward you this communication... These aforesaid mawworms, creaming over with a superabundance of piety, and blinded by too much zeal, forget their divine calling, and stem to profit little by the divine behest which bears reference to evil-speaking and slander."
According to Price, who had attended the service, the minister declared that the present class of professionals, with very few exceptions, were dissipated in private and rakish in public, and that they pandered to the depraved and vitiated tastes of playgoers. Furthermore, theatre managers "held out the strongest inducements to women of an abandoned character to visit their theatres, in order to encourage the attendance of those of the opposite sex.
[35]
American author and co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church Ellen G. White wrote her concern that theatricality, among other forms of entertainment, would hinder one's spirituality and morality. She wrote in one of her books,
Testimonies for the Church vol. 4
:
[36]
"Among the most dangerous resorts for pleasure is the theater. Instead of being a school of morality and virtue, as is so often claimed, it is the very hotbed of immorality. Vicious habits and sinful propensities are strengthened and confirmed by these entertainments. Low songs, lewd gestures, expressions, and attitudes, deprave the imagination and debase the morals. Every youth who habitually attends such exhibitions will be corrupted in principle. There is no influence in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to destroy religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of life than theatrical amusements. The love for these scenes increases with every indulgence, as the desire for intoxicating drinks strengthens with its use. The only safe course is to shun the theater, the circus, and every other questionable place of amusement."
In France the opposition was even more intense and ubiquitous. The
Encyclopedie théologique
(1847) records: "The excommunication pronounced against comedians, actors, actresses tragic or comic, is of the greatest and most respectable antiquity... it forms part of the general discipline of the French Church... This Church allows them neither the sacraments nor burial; it refuses them its suffrages and its prayers, not only as infamous persons and public sinners, but as excommunicated persons... One must deal with the comedians as with public sinners, remove them from participation with holy things while they belong to the theater, admit when they leave it."

She later returned the books, recommending they be burnt and saying, "Is  it not a very odd thing that I, an old woman of eighty and upwards, sitting alone, feel myself ashamed to read a book which, sixty years ago, I have heard read aloud for the amusement of large circles, consisting of the first and most creditable society in London."

In
Jane Austen
's
Mansfield Park
(1814), Sir Thomas Bertram gives expression to social anti-theatrical views. Returning from his slave plantations in Antigua, he discovers his adult children preparing an amateur production of
Elizabeth Inchbald
's
Lovers Vows
.
He argues vehemently, using statements such as "unsafe amusements" and "noisy pleasures" that will "offend his ideas of
decorum
" and burns all unbound copies of the play.
Fanny Price
, the heroine judges that the two leading female roles in
Lovers Vows
are "unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty".
Mansfield Park
, with its strong moralist theme and criticism of corrupted standards, has generated more debate than any other of Austen's works, polarising supporters and critics. It sets up an opposition between a vulnerable young woman with strongly held religious and moral principles against a group of worldly, highly cultivated, well-to-do young people who pursue pleasure without principle.
[38]
Austen herself was an avid theatregoer and an admirer of actors like Kean. In childhood she had participated in full-length popular plays (and several written by herself) that were supervised by her clergyman father, performed in the family dining room and at a later stage in the family barn where theatrical scenery was stored.

[41]
She continued to visit the theatre after writing
Mansfield Park
. Byrne also argues strongly that Austen's novels have considerable dramatic structure, making them particularly adaptable for screen representation.
[39]
A careful reading of Austen's text shows that while there is considerable debate about the propriety of amateur theatre, even Edmund and Fanny, who both oppose the production, have an appreciation of good theatricals.
In
Thackeray
's
Vanity Fair

Earlier divergence of church and stage
[
edit
]
An editorial in
The Era
, quoted a contemporary writer outlining the history of the divergence of Church and Stage following the Middle Ages, and arguing that the conflict was unnecessary:
"So long as the drama had been content to be mainly the echo of the pulpit, some bond of sympathy, however slight, continued to exist between priests and players. But as soon as the theatre claimed to have a voice of its own, to have its own aims and objects, its own field of enterprise, its own mode of action, that bond was broken. The functions of the church were found to be different from those of the theatre; and because their functions were different the fatal fallacy, which has been, and still is, the cause of so much misunderstanding, sprang at once into existence, that therefore their interests must be opposed."
—
'Clerical Showmen', The Era, 13 November 1886
In the second half of the 19th century, Evangelical Christians established many societies for the relief of poverty. Some were created to help working women, particularly those whose occupation placed them in 'exceptional moral danger'. Evangelical groups tended towards 'charity' for the oppressed. 'Christian Socialists', distinctively different, (as in the
Church and Stage Guild
) were more likely to direct their energies towards what they considered to be the root causes of poverty.
1873 - The Theatrical Mission
[
edit
]
The Theatrical Mission was formed by two Evangelicals in 1873 to support vulnerable girls employed in travelling companies, the first being a group in a company that went on tour after performing their pantomime at the Crystal Palace.  By 1884, the Mission was sending out some 1,000 supportive letters a month.  They then opened a club, '
Macready
House', in
Henrietta Street
, close to the London theatres, that provided cheap lunches and teas, and later, accommodation. They looked after children employed on the stage and, for any girl who was pregnant, encouraged her to seek help from the Theatre Ladies Guild which would arrange for the confinement and find other work for her after the baby was born.
[42]
The Mission attracted royal patronage. Towards the end of the century, an undercover journalist from
The Era
investigated Macready House, reporting it as 'patronising to the profession' and sub-standard.

In November 1879,
The Era
, responding to a resurgence of interest in religious circles about the Stage, reported a lecture defending the stage at a Nottingham church gathering. The speaker noted increased tolerance amongst church people and approved of the recent formation of the
Church and Stage Guild
. For too long, the clergy had referred to theatre as the 'Devil's House'. The chairman in his summary stated that while there was good in the theatre, he did not think the clergy could support the Stage as presently constituted.
[44]
The
Church and Stage Guild
had been founded earlier that year by the Rev
Stewart Headlam
on 30 May. Within a year it had more than 470 members with at least 91 clergy and 172 professional theatre people. Its mission included breaking down "the prejudice against theatres, actors, music hall artists, stage singers, and dancers."
[45]
Headlam had been removed from his previous post by
John Jackson
, Bishop of London, following a lecture Headlam gave in 1877 entitled
Theatres and Music Halls
in which he promoted Christian involvement in these establishments. Jackson, writing to Headlam, and after distancing himself from any Puritanism, said, "I do pray earnestly that you may not have to meet before the Judgment Seat those whom your encouragement first led to places where they lost the blush of shame and took the first downward step towards vice and misery."

The Sign of the Cross

a work intended to bring church and stage closer together

[47]
Tonight at the Grand opera house Wilson Barrett produced his new play, "The Sign of the Cross." to a large audience. It is a professed attempt to conciliate the prejudices which church members are said to have for the stage and to bring the two nearer together. Of the play, the actor-author says: "With 'The Sign of the Cross' I stand today half way over the bridge that I have striven to construct to span the gulf between the two. I think it is but justice to expect the denouncers of my profession to come the other half of the way to meet me."
Ben Greet
, an English actor-manager with a number of companies, formed a touring
Sign of the Cross
Company. The play proved particularly popular in England and Australia and was performed for several decades, often drawing audiences that did not normally attend the theatre.

William Morton (theatre manager) § 'Church and Stage'
William Morton
was a provincial theatre manager in England whose management experience spanned the 70 years between 1865 and 1935. He often commented on his experiences of theatre and cinema, and also reflected on national trends. He challenged the church when he believed it to be judgmental or hypocritical. He also strove to bring quality entertainment to the masses, though the masses did not always respond to his provision. Over his career, he reported a very gradual acceptance of theatre by the 'respectable classes' and by the church. Morton was a committed Christian though not a party man in religion or politics. A man of principle, he maintained an unusual policy of no-alcohol in all his theatres.

Morton commented in his memoirs, "At this period there was more bigotry than now. As a rule the religious community looked upon actors and press men as less godly than other people."

echoed, "To many of extreme religious views, his profession was anathema". It also reported that many had considered Morton's profession "a wasteful extravagance which lured young people from the narrow path they should tread".
[50]
1910 - The same goal
[
edit
]
Morton stated in a public lecture held at Salem Chapel that he censured clergy "when they go out their way to preach against play-acting and warn their flock not to see it".
[51]
In another lecture he said that "the Protestant Church took too prejudiced a view against the stage. Considering their greater temptations I do not consider that actors are any worse than the rest of the community. Both the Church and the Stage are moving to the same goal. No drama is successful which makes vice triumphant. Many of the poor do not go to church and chapel, and but for the theatre they might come to fail to see the advantage in being moral".
[52]
1921 - Actor's Church Union
[
edit
]
Morton received a circular from a Hull vicar, Rev. R. Chalmers. It described his small parish as full of evil-doing aliens, the crime-plotting homeless and a floating population of the theatrical profession. Said
The Stage
, this "represents a survival of that antagonistic spirit to the stage which the work of the Actors' Church Union has done so much to kill".
[53]
(Chalmers was noted for his charitable work so the real issue may have been more about poor communication.)
1938 - Greater tolerance
[
edit
]
Morton lived to see greater tolerance. On his hundredth birthday the
Hull Daily
Mail
said Morton was held in great respect, "even by those who would not dream of entering any theatre.  Whatever he brought for his patrons, grand opera, musical comedy, drama, or pantomime, came as a clean, wholesome entertainment."

Principles of Compiler Design
, by
Alfred Aho
and
Jeffrey Ullman
, is a classic textbook on
compilers
for
computer
programming languages
.  Both of the authors won the 2020
Turing award
for their work on compilers.
It is often called the "
green dragon book
"
[1]
and its cover depicts a
knight
and a
dragon
in battle; the dragon is green, and labeled "Complexity of Compiler Design", while the knight wields a lance and a shield labeled "
LALR parser generator
" and "Syntax Directed Translation" respectively, and rides a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". The book may be called the "green dragon book" to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi & Ullman's
Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools
, which is the "red dragon book".
[1]
The second edition of
Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools
added a fourth author,
Monica S. Lam
, and the dragon became purple; hence becoming the "purple dragon book." The book also contains the entire code for making a compiler. 
The back cover offers the original inspiration of the cover design: The dragon is replaced by windmills, and the knight is
Don Quixote
.
The book was published by
Addison-Wesley
,
0-201-00022-9
. The acknowledgments mention that the book was entirely typeset at
Bell Labs
using
troff
on the
Unix
operating system
, little of which had, at that time, been seen outside the Laboratories.

Still-life with Flowers
Laura Bernasconi
was an Italian painter of the
Baroque
period, known to be active in 1674.
Life
[
edit
]
Born and died in
Rome
, she trained with
Mario Nuzzi
, and like him, painted
still life
paintings of flowers. She worked in
Rome
from 1622 to 1675. Little is known about her: she was a pupil of
Mario Nuzzi
, known as Mario de 'Fiori.  Mario Nuzzi was a master of
Pier Francesco Cittadini
and
Paolo Porpora
and painted in a style close to that of
Francesco Caldei
(known as Francesco Mantovano).
[1]
From Nuzzi she learned to compose large bunches of multicolored flowers.
River in a forest
In
L'Abecedario pittorico
('ABC of Painting') by the Bolognese writer and art historian
Pellegrino Antonio Orlandi
[2]
we read: Laura Bernasconi, a Roman painter, she learned how to paint the flowers from Mario Nuzzi, and succeeded in perfection, she made the ornamentation of the painting
St. Gaetano
, painted by
Andrea Camassei
in
St. Andrea della Valle
. In the sacristy of this church, there is the altar with the altarpiece of
San Gaetano
, portrayed in prayer among the Angels. The flowers that embellish the painting are executed by Laura Bernasconi.
Work
[
edit
]
Laura Bernasconi painted, with
Carlo Ruthard
and her son Filippo, between 1665 and 1668, the ceiling of the Gallery in
Palazzo Colonna
. Her works are in collections in Rome, including the
Galleria Doria Pamphilj
.

Passenger statistics from the
Office of Rail and Road
Oxford Parkway railway station
is a
railway station
at
Water Eaton, Oxfordshire
, on the
Oxford-Bicester line
. Full regular weekday service began on Monday 26 October 2015,
[2]
although the first passengers travelled the previous day on a Sunday timetable.
[3]
The station, whose name was changed in September 2013 from the provisional "Water Eaton Parkway",
[4]
[5]
lies between
Kidlington
and
Oxford
beside the existing Water Eaton
park-and-ride
site.
[6]
It serves Kidlington, north Oxford and nearby villages. The station forms part of a multi-modal transport interchange node, connecting travellers by bus, cycle, on foot and by car with rail transport.  It is also intended to attract park-and-ride traffic from the busy
A34
,
A40
and
A44 roads
.
Services to Oxford started on 11 December 2016.
[7]
Description
[
edit
]
The station is part of
Project Evergreen 3
, funded and managed by
Chiltern Railways
. It is served every half-hour by trains from London
Marylebone
. Chiltern Railways opened the station in October 2015 for trains towards Bicester and
London Marylebone
, with services to
Oxford railway station
beginning in December 2016, delayed from Spring 2016 as locals objected to the extra noise that would be caused.
[8]
[9]
The journey time to London is about an hour.  Network Rail completed the final track upgrades on this portion of the route in September 2016
[10]
allowing driver training runs on the line ahead of the inauguration of new services on 11 December.
The
East West Rail Consortium
's planned rail service between Oxford and
Milton Keynes Central
and
Bedford
Midland will also serve Oxford Parkway.
[11]
The station is on the site of the
Buckinghamshire Railway
's temporary Oxford Banbury Road terminus (1850-51), and north-east of the site of the former
Oxford Road Halt
(1905-26). In 1942 a Government grain
silo
was built next to the site as part of a Second World War network to concentrate scarce food and distribute it by rail. It was in use until the late 1980s.
[12]
In October 2013 Chiltern Railways had it demolished as part of site preparation for the new station and car park.
[13]
The station in November 2015, soon after opening
Water Eaton Park-and-Ride is immediately adjacent, with bus services to central Oxford,
[14]
London Oxford Airport
and to the Headington hospitals (Monday to Friday only).
[15]
The station lies on
National Cycle Route 51
, which links Oxford to Bicester and further East.
[16]
Oxford Parkway has covered two-level parking for 152 pedal cycles adjacent to the entrance, additional to the existing cycle parking at the nearby Park & Ride.  It has CCTV surveillance.
[17]
The car park has 815 standard spaces, plus 41 spaces for passengers with reduced mobility. There is realtime information about remaining available spaces.
[18]
There is a fee to park a car
[6]
but the first hour is free.  There are also spaces for 30 motorcycles.
Purchase of rail travel tickets is by machine; there is no ticket office at the station,
[17]
but there is an information desk. Toilet and refreshment facilities are also present.
Grain silo
[
edit
]
Prior to the station's construction, the site was occupied by a large grain silo. This followed a standard pattern common to other wartime silos, taking the form of two banks of ten seven-storey high cylindrical reinforced concrete silos side by side with the space between them filled by a brick access shaft. In the shaft there were associated grain handling machinery and two enormous grain driers which extended the full height of the building. It was built in the early 1940s and closed in the late 1980s, after which the yard surrounding it was used by several local businesses including a pet food supplier and a car breaker.
[19]
Construction

Platforms under construction in April 2015, looking towards

Building of the station began in late October 2014 and was sufficiently advanced for services to begin 12 months later.

The
1968-69 season
was
Port Vale
's 57th season of football in the
English Football League
, and their fourth successive season (fifth overall) in the
Fourth Division
.
[1]
New
manager
Gordon Lee
used the season to consolidate the club after it was readmitted to the Football League immediately after being expelled for illegal payment of players. Managing 46 goals scored and conceded, and 46 points gained in 46 games, he had built a solid base for future progress. However the club's financial problems continued, as another loss was made to increase the club's debt levels.
Overview
[
edit
]
Fourth Division
[
edit
]
On 8 June, the club's future was decided, as a vote of 39 to 9 allowed the club readmission to the Football League, despite the conclusion of an investigation earlier in the year which ruled that the club should be expelled from the League.
[1]
New
manager
Gordon Lee
thus began work on rebuilding his squad, announcing a team approach with an additional 'individual
coaching
plan' for players to improve their personal weaknesses.
[1]
Lee was big on coaching, and replaced
cross country running
exercises with realistic match-day situations.
[1]
Stanley Matthews
would become more of a
scout
and would only visit
Burslem
on a weekly basis, he also agreed to allow the £9,000 owed to him in payments delayed until the club were on a sounder financial footing.
[1]
His name removed from his office door, he 'gradually drifted out of the picture'.
[1]
Three signings of note included: 'tenacious' wing-half
John King
(
Tranmere Rovers
);
Wales international
winger
Graham Williams
(
Tranmere Rovers
); and teenager
Bobby Gough
(
Walsall
).
[1]
The season opened with four
Roy Chapman
goals in four games, though only three points were won in the first six encounters. With Sharratt out injured, in came 'part-time, pipe-smoking
civil servant
'
Geoff Hickson
on
loan
from
Crewe Alexandra
.
[1]
Lee quickly earned the respect of the Vale fans despite his team lying bottom of the table in mid-September.
[1]
A new club
mascot
was unveiled at this time - 'Prince Val'.
[1]
Some good home performances lifted the club off the bottom of the table, including a 4-1 thumping of
Scunthorpe United
and a stylish back-heeled goal from
Roy Sproson
in a 1-1 draw with
Lincoln City
.
[1]
Chapman then developed
sciatica
and had to be rested until December.
[1]
An excellent defence helped the club then to achieve a five-game unbeaten run in the league.
[1]
In November, goalkeeper
Keith Ball
was signed from
Walsall
for 'a small fee' and
Graham Newton
joined on trial after leaving the
Atlanta Chiefs
.
[1]
On Boxing day, Vale travelled to
Sincil Bank
, where they beat second-placed Lincoln 1-0 in front of 12,208 spectators.
[1]
Soon after
Bill Asprey
retired as a player to coach at
Sheffield Wednesday
.
[1]
A 5-0 mauling of
Newport County
on 18 January sent the Vale into the top half of the table, though just one goal was scored and one point gained in the next four games.
[1]
In March, Lee adopted a more 'hit and run' style, and saw his team achieve three straight wins.
[1]
On the 29th, with the club seeming safe from re-election, '
hooliganism
reared its ugly head' as
Chester
found their team bus smashed with bricks following a 2-1 loss at
Burslem
.
[1]
On 21 April, Sproson made his 700th league appearance in a 1-0 win over struggling
Grimsby Town
.
[1]
The final day was a 1-1 draw with wooden-spoon club
Bradford Park Avenue
, though the Vale had five goals disallowed.
[1]
Nevertheless, this game was the first of a
club-record
nineteen league game streak without a loss that would end on 22 November 1969 the following season.
They finished in thirteenth place with 46 points from their 46 games, scoring 46 and conceding 46 goals.
[1]
Finances
[
edit
]
On the financial side, a £10,900 loss was made despite donations of £16,734 from the Sportsmen's Association and the Development Fund.
[1]
This left the club's total debts standing at £178,277.
[1]
The club needed an average home attendance of 6,000 to break even, and were almost two thousand short of this total.
[1]
More stringent economies were thus imposed upon the club.
[1]
Five professionals left on
free transfers
:
Mick Cullerton
(Chester);
Mick Mahon
(
York City
);
Jimmy Goodfellow
(Workington); Graham Williams (
Runcorn
); and Milija Aleksic (
Eastwood
).
[1]
Lee claimed 'it was a hard decision, but I have had to create room for improvement'.
[1]
Roy Chapman was offered a new
contract
, but opted instead to sign with Chester.
[1]
Cup competitions
[
edit
]
In the
FA Cup
, with Sharrat injured and Hickson re-called by Crewe, seventeen-year-old
Milija Aleksic
was roped in to play in the first-round clash with
Third Division
Shrewsbury Town
.
[1]
He also played in the
replay
following the 1-1 draw, and the club progressed with a 3-1 win over their 'lacklustre' opponents.
[1]
The "Valiants" also required a replay to progress past
Workington
. Vale then exited at the third round with a 1-0 defeat at
Vicarage Road
to
Watford
.
In the
League Cup
, defeat came in the first round to
Wrexham
at the
Racecourse Ground
.
Stuart Sharratt
cracked a
kneecap
in the game and later contracted a
virus
in his
blood
, which kept him out of action for the rest of the season.

The breweries business was merged with Carlsberg in 1992 and became Carlsberg-Tetley, which is now part of
Carlsberg Group
, with Carlsberg-Tetley now known as Carlsberg UK.
Ind Coope Burton Brewery was sold by Carlsberg-Tetley to Bass in 1997. Through a series of take-overs and name changes, it is now owned by
Molson Coors
and operates as Burton North Brewery.

[1]
Early life and education
[

Bint Jbeil
in
South Lebanon
.
[2]
Baydoun held a bachelor of science degree in mathematics from
Lebanese University
and a PhD in mathematics from
Claude Bernard University
in
Lyon
, France.
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
Baydoun worked as mathematics professor at Lebanese University from 1976 to 1988. In 1980, he became a senior official of the
Amal Movement
. He was named a member of Amal's political bureau in 1982 and appointed president of the bureau on 14 October 1998. Baydoun is also former president of Amal's council of the south (1985-1991). In 1991, he was appointed deputy from Amal and elected in the
general election
in 1992 and
general election
in 1996
[3]
for the Shi’ite seat in
Tyre
, South Lebanon.
[2]
He also won his seat in the

in 2000
[4]
receiving more votes than
Hezbollah
candidates.
[5]
Baydoun also served as government minister in different cabinets. He was first appointed minister of housing and cooperatives in
Omar Karami
's government. He served in this post from 24 December 1990 to 10 May 1992. Then, he was appointed minister of electrical and water resources in
Rachid Al Solh

March 14 Coalition
.
[1]
Baydoun had also business activities and was a member of the board and of the audit committee of the İBL Bank.
[9]
Views and influence
[
edit
]
At the beginning of the 2000s, Baydoun was a pro-Syrian politician, who had close ties with "old guards" in
Damascus
such as
Hikmat Shihabi
and
Abdul Halim Khaddam
.
[10]
In June 2008, Baydoun stated that
Saad Hariri
was unable to organize the Sunni community or defend it and to build the institutions of state.
[11]
The Shiite community of Lebanon has been dominated by a number of
feudal
families.
[12]
Although Baydoun was not part of these families, he was among the individuals who has influence on the Shiite community.

England
is a
country
that is part of the
United Kingdom
.
[6]
It shares land borders with
Wales
to its west and
Scotland
to its north, while
Ireland
is located across the
Irish Sea
to its west and northwest, and the
Celtic Sea
lies to its southwest. It is separated from
continental Europe
by the
North Sea
to the east and the
English Channel
to the south. The country covers roughly 62% of the island of
Great Britain
, which is in the
North Atlantic
, and includes
over 100 smaller islands
such as the
Isles of Scilly
and the
Isle of Wight
.
The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the
Upper Paleolithic
, but takes its name from the
Angles
, a
Germanic
tribe who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the
Age of Discovery
, which began during the 15th century.
[7]
The
Kingdom of England
, which included Wales after 1535, ceased being a separate
sovereign state
on 1 May 1707 when the
Acts of Union
put the terms agreed in the
Treaty of Union
the previous year into effect; this resulted in a political union with the
Kingdom of Scotland
that created the
Kingdom of Great Britain
.
[8]
England is the origin of many well-known worldwide exports, including the
English language
, the
English law
system (which served as the basis for the
common law
systems of many other countries),
association football
(the world's most popular sport), and the
Church of England
; its
parliamentary system of government
has been widely adopted by other nations.
[9]
The
Industrial Revolution
began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.
[10]
England is home to
the two oldest universities
in the English-speaking world: the
University of Oxford
, founded in 1096, and the
University of Cambridge
, founded in 1209. Both universities are ranked among the most prestigious in the world.
[11]
[12]
England's terrain chiefly consists of low hills and
plains
, especially in the
centre
and
south
. Upland and mountainous terrain is mostly found in the
north
and
west
, including
Dartmoor
, the
Lake District
, the
Pennines
, and the
Shropshire Hills
. The country's capital is
London
, the
greater metropolitan
of which has a population of 14.2 million as of 2021, representing the United Kingdom's largest metropolitan area. England's population of 56.3 million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom,
[13]
largely concentrated around London, the
southeast
, and conurbations in the centre, the
northwest
, the
northeast
, and
Yorkshire
, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.
[14]
Toponymy
See also:
Toponymy of England
The name "England" is derived from the
Old English
name
Englaland
, which means "land of the
Angles
".
[15]
The Angles were one of the
Germanic tribes
that settled in Great Britain during the
Early Middle Ages
. The Angles came from the
Anglia
peninsula in the
Bay of Kiel
area (present-day German state of
Schleswig-Holstein
) of the
Baltic Sea
.
[16]
The earliest recorded use of the term, as "
Engla londe
", is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of
Bede
's
Ecclesiastical History of the English People
. The term was then used to mean "the land inhabited by the English", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of
Northumbria
. The
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
recorded that the
Domesday Book
of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the
Chronicle
stated that King
Malcolm III
went "out of Scotlande into
Lothian
in Englaland", thus using it in the more ancient sense.
[17]
The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by
Tacitus
,
Germania
, in which the
Latin
word
Anglii
is used.
[18]
The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an
angular
shape.
[19]
How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the
Saxons
, came to be used for the entire country is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain
Angli Saxones
or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony in Germany.
[20]
In
Scottish Gaelic
, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (
Sasunn
);
[21]
similarly, the
Welsh
name for the English language is "
Saesneg
". A romantic name for England is
Loegria
, related to the Welsh word for England,
Lloegr
, and made popular by its use in
Arthurian legend
.
Albion
is also applied to England in a more poetic capacity,
[22]
though its original meaning is the island of Britain as a whole.
History

History of England
For a chronological guide, see
Timeline of English history
.
Prehistory and antiquity
Main article:
Prehistoric Britain
Stonehenge
, a
Neolithic
monument
The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of
Homo antecessor
, dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago.
[23]
Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the
Upper Paleolithic
period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.
[24]
After the
last ice age
only large mammals such as
mammoths
,
bison
and
woolly rhinoceros
remained. Roughly 11,000 years ago, when the
ice sheets
began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the
Iberian Peninsula
.
[25]
The sea level was lower than the present day and Britain was connected by
land bridge
to Ireland and
Eurasia
.
[26]
As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.
The
Beaker culture
arrived around 2,500 BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores.
[27]
It was during this time that major
Neolithic
monuments such as
Stonehenge
and
Avebury
were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made
bronze
, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron
smelting
allowed the construction of better
ploughs
, advancing agriculture (for instance, with
Celtic fields
), as well as the production of more effective weapons.
[28]
The
Battersea Shield
is one of the most significant pieces of ancient
Celtic art
found in Britain.
During the
Iron Age
,
Celtic culture
, deriving from the
Hallstatt
and
La Tène cultures
, arrived from Central Europe.
Brythonic
was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to
Ptolemy
's
Geographia
there were around 20 tribes in the area. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the
Roman Republic
attempted to
invade twice
in 55 BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a
client king
from the
Trinovantes
.
The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor
Claudius
, subsequently
conquering much of Britain
, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as
Britannia province
.
[29]
The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the
Catuvellauni
led by
Caratacus
. Later, an uprising led by
Boudica
, Queen of the
Iceni
, ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the
Battle of Watling Street
.
[30]
The author of one study of Roman Britain suggested that from 43 AD to 84 AD, the Roman invaders killed somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 people from a population of perhaps 2,000,000.
[31]
This era saw a
Greco-Roman
culture prevail with the introduction of
Roman law
,
Roman architecture
,
aqueducts
,
sewers
, many agricultural items and silk.
[32]
In the 3rd century, Emperor
Septimius Severus
died at
Eboracum
(now
York
), where
Constantine
was subsequently proclaimed emperor a century later.
[33]
There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to
Bede
, missionaries were sent from Rome by
Eleutherius
at the request of the chieftain
Lucius of Britain
in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through
Joseph of Arimathea
, while others claim through Lucius of Britain.
[34]
By 410, during the
decline of the Roman Empire
, Britain was left exposed by the
end of Roman rule in Britain
and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.
[35]
Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished. This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local "congregations" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.
[36]
Middle Ages
Main article:
England in the Middle Ages
Replica of the 7th-century ceremonial
Sutton Hoo helmet
from the
Kingdom of East Anglia
Roman military
withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons,
Angles
,
Jutes
and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province. These groups then began to settle in increasing numbers over the course of the fifth and sixth centuries, initially in the eastern part of the country.
[35]
Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the
Battle of Mount Badon
, but subsequently resumed, overrunning the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under
Brittonic
control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a
Dark Age
. Details of the
Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
are consequently subject to considerable disagreement; the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west, where Celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under Anglo-Saxon control.
[37]
[38]
Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, been replaced in the conquered territories by
Anglo-Saxon paganism
, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by
Augustine
from 597.
[39]
Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the
Council of Whitby
(664), which was ostensibly about
tonsures
(clerical haircuts) and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice.
[36]
During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including
Northumbria
,
Mercia
,
Wessex
,
East Anglia
,
Essex
,
Kent
and
Sussex
. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.
[40]
The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.
[41]
In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the
Danes
culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under
Alfred the Great
was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the
Danelaw
. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under
Æthelstan
in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by
Eadred
in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by
Sweyn Forkbeard
in 1013 and again by his son
Cnut
in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived
North Sea Empire
that also included
Denmark
and
Norway
. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of
Edward the Confessor
in 1042.
King Henry V
at the
Battle of Agincourt
, fought on
Saint Crispin's Day
and concluded with an English victory against a larger French army in the
Hundred Years' War
A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the
Norman Conquest
in 1066, accomplished by an army led by
Duke William of Normandy
.
[42]
The
Normans
themselves originated from
Scandinavia
and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.
[43]
This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.
[44]
Subsequently, the
House of Plantagenet
from Anjou inherited the English throne under
Henry II
, adding England to the budding
Angevin Empire
of fiefs the family had inherited in France including
Aquitaine
.
[45]
They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being
Richard I
,
Edward I
,
Edward III
and
Henry V
.
[45]
The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the
Magna Carta
, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic
monasticism
flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The
Principality of Wales
became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century
[46]
and the
Lordship of Ireland
was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.
During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the
House of Valois
both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the
House of Capet
and with it France; the two powers clashed in the
Hundred Years' War
.
[47]
The
Black Death
epidemic
hit England
; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's
inhabitants
.
[48]
From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family - the
Yorkists
and
Lancastrians
- known as the
Wars of the Roses
.
[49]
Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the
Tudors
, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by
Henry Tudor
who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the
Battle of Bosworth Field
where the Yorkist king
Richard III
was killed.
[50]
Early modern period
King Henry VIII
(1491-1547)
Queen Elizabeth I
(1558-1603)
During the
Tudor period
, England began to develop
naval skills
, and exploration intensified in the
Age of Discovery
.
[51]
Henry VIII
broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the
Acts of Supremacy
in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the
Church of England
. In contrast with much of European
Protestantism
, the
roots of the split
were more political than theological.
[a]
He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the
1535-1542 acts
. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters,
Mary I
and
Elizabeth I
. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of
Anglicanism
. The
Elizabethan era
is the epoch in the Tudor age of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ("the Virgin Queen"). Historians often depict it as the
golden age
in English history that represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of great art, drama, poetry, music and literature.
[53]
England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government.
[54]
Competing with
Spain
, the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer
Walter Raleigh
in
Virginia
and named
Roanoke
. The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship.
[55]
With the
East India Company
, England also competed with the
Dutch
and
French
in the East. During the Elizabethan period, England was at war with Spain. An
armada
sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under
Lord Howard of Effingham
. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in
1596
and
1597
, but both were driven back by storms.
Union with Scotland
Further information:
Union of the Crowns
and
Treaty of Union
The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the
King of Scots
,
James VI
, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I, thereby creating a
personal union
.
[56]
He styled himself
King of Great Britain
, although this had no basis in English law.
[57]
Under the auspices of James VI and I the Authorised
King James Version
of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.
The
English Restoration
restored the monarchy under King
Charles II
and peace after the
English Civil War
.
Based on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the
English Civil War
was fought between the supporters of
Parliament
and those of King
Charles I
, known colloquially as
Roundheads
and
Cavaliers
respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
, involving
Scotland
and
Ireland
. The Parliamentarians were victorious,
Charles I was executed
and the kingdom replaced by the
Commonwealth
. Leader of the Parliament forces,
Oliver Cromwell
declared himself
Lord Protector
in 1653; a period of
personal rule
followed.
[58]
After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son
Richard
as Lord Protector,
Charles II
was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the
Restoration
. With the reopening of theatres, fine arts, literature and performing arts flourished throughout the Restoration of ''the Merry Monarch'' Charles II.
[59]
After the
Glorious Revolution
of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the
Bill of Rights
in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament.
[60]
Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the
House of Commons
when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the
State Opening of Parliament
by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed in the face of the monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch.
[61]
With the founding of the
Royal Society
in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.
By the mid-to-late 17th century, two political factions had emerged - the
Tories
and
Whigs
. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king
James II
, some of them, along with the Whigs, during the
Revolution of 1688
invited the Dutch
Prince William of Orange
to defeat James and become the king. Some English people, especially in the north, were
Jacobites
and continued to support James and his sons. Under the
Stuart dynasty
England expanded in trade, finance and prosperity. Britain developed Europe's largest merchant fleet.
[62]
After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed,
[63]
the two countries joined in
political union
, to create the
Kingdom of Great Britain
in 1707.
[56]
To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate.
[64]

Under the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other
English initiatives
combined with the
Scottish Enlightenment
to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in
British overseas trade
protected by the
Royal Navy
paved the way for the establishment of the
British Empire
. Domestically it drove the
Industrial Revolution
, a period of profound change in the
socioeconomic
and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development.
[65]
The opening of Northwest England's
Bridgewater Canal
in 1761 ushered in the
canal age in Britain
.
[66]
In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway - the
Stockton and Darlington Railway
- opened to the public.
[66]
The
Battle of Trafalgar
was a naval engagement between the British
Royal Navy
and the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies during the
Napoleonic Wars
.
[67]
During the
Industrial Revolution
, many workers moved from England's countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at
Birmingham
and
Manchester
,
[68]
with the latter the world's first industrial city.
[69]
England maintained relative stability throughout the
French Revolution
, under
George III
and
William Pitt the Younger
. The
regency of George IV
is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture.
[70]
During the
Napoleonic Wars
,
Napoleon
planned to
invade from the south-east
; however, this failed to manifest and the Napoleonic forces were defeated by the British: at sea by
Horatio Nelson
, and on land by
Arthur Wellesley
. The major victory at the
Battle of Trafalgar
confirmed the naval supremacy Britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century.
[71]
The Napoleonic Wars fostered a concept of
Britishness
and a united national
British people
, shared with the English, Scots and Welsh.
[72]
The
Victorian era
is often cited as a
Golden Age
. Painting done by
William Powell Frith
to show cultural divisions.
London became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the
Victorian era
, and trade within the British Empire - as well as the standing of the British military and navy - was prestigious.
[73]
Technologically, this era saw many innovations that proved key to the United Kingdom's power and prosperity.
[74]
Political agitation at home from radicals such as the
Chartists
and the
suffragettes
enabled legislative reform and
universal suffrage
.
[75]
Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the
Allies
.
[b]
Two decades later, in
World War II
, the United Kingdom was again one of the
Allies
. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during
the Blitz
. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid
decolonisation
, and there was a speeding-up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and
Frank Whittle
's development of the
jet engine
led to wider
air travel
.
[77]
Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the
National Health Service
in 1948, providing
publicly funded health care
to all permanent residents free at the point of need. Combined, these prompted the reform of
local government in England
in the mid-20th century.
[78]
Since the 20th century, there has been significant population movement to England, mostly from other parts of the
British Isles
, but also from the
Commonwealth
, particularly the
Indian subcontinent
.
[79]
Since the 1970s there has been a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the
service industry
.
[80]
As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a
common market
initiative called the
European Economic Community
which became the
European Union
. Since the late 20th century the
administration of the United Kingdom
has moved towards
devolved governance
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
[81]
England and Wales
continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom.
[82]
Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism.
[83]
There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by
referendum
.
[84]
Governance
Politics
Main article:
Politics of England
The
Palace of Westminster
, the seat of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
England is part of the United Kingdom, a
constitutional monarchy
with a
parliamentary system
.
[85]
There has not been a
government of England
since 1707, when the
Acts of Union 1707
, putting into effect the terms of the
Treaty of Union
, joined England and Scotland to form the
Kingdom of Great Britain
.
[63]
Before the union England was ruled by
its monarch
and the
Parliament of England
. Today England is governed directly by the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
, although other
countries of the United Kingdom
have
devolved
governments.
[86]
In the
House of Commons
which is the
lower house
of the British Parliament based at the
Palace of Westminster
, there are 532 members of parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.
[87]
England is represented by 345 MPs from the
Conservative Party
, 179 from the
Labour Party
, seven from the
Liberal Democrats
, one from the
Green Party
, and the
Speaker of the House
.
Since devolution, in which other countries of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland
- each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various
regions of England
would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the
North East
in a
2004 referendum
, this has not been carried out.
[84]
Law
Main article:
English law
The
Royal Courts of Justice
The
English law
legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of
common law
[88]
legal systems used in most
Commonwealth
countries
[89]
and the United States (except
Louisiana
). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the
Courts of England and Wales
continued, under the
Treaty of Union
, as a separate legal system from
the one used in Scotland
. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of
legal precedent
-
stare decisis
- to the facts before them.
[90]
The court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the
Court of Appeal
, the
High Court of Justice
for civil cases, and the
Crown Court
for criminal cases.
[91]
The
Supreme Court of the United Kingdom
is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in
England and Wales
. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the
judicial functions of the House of Lords
.
[92]
A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.
[93]
The
Secretary of State for Justice
is the minister responsible to Parliament for the
judiciary
, the court system and prisons and probation in England.
[94]
Crime increased between 1981 and 1995 but fell by 42% in the period 1995-2006.
[95]
The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it one of the
highest incarceration rates
in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.
[96]
His Majesty's Prison Service
, reporting to the
Ministry of Justice
, manages most prisons, housing 81,309 prisoners in England and Wales as of September 2022
.

Ceremonial counties of England
The
subdivisions of England
consist of up to four levels of
subnational division
, controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of
local government
.
Outside the London region, England's highest tier is the 48
ceremonial counties
.
[98]
These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference. Of these, 38 developed gradually since the
Middle Ages
; these were reformed to 51 in 1974 and to their current number in 1996.
[99]
Each has a
Lord Lieutenant
and
High Sheriff
; these posts are used to represent the
British monarch
locally.
[98]
Some counties, such as
Herefordshire
, are only divided further into civil parishes. The royal county of Berkshire and the metropolitan counties have different types of status to other ceremonial counties.
[100]
The second tier is made up of
combined authorities
and the 27
county-tier
shire counties
. In 1974, all ceremonial counties were two-tier; and with the metropolitan county tier phased out, the 1996 reform separated the ceremonial county and the administrative county tier.
England is also divided into local government districts.
[101]
The district can align to a ceremonial county, or be a district tier within a
shire county
, be a
royal
or
metropolitan borough
, have
borough
or
city status
, or be a
unitary authority
.
At the community level, much of England is divided into
civil parishes
with their own
councils
; in Greater London only one such parish,
Queen's Park
, exists as of 2014
after they were
abolished in 1965
until legislation
allowed their recreation
in 2007.
London
From 1994 until the early 2010s England was divided for a few purposes into regions; a
1998 referendum
for the London Region created the
London Assembly
two years later.
[102]
A failed
2004 North East England devolution referendum
cancelled further
regional assembly
devolution
[84]
with the regional structure outside London abolished.
Ceremonially and administratively, the region is divided between the
City of London
and
Greater London
; these are further divided into the 32
London Boroughs
and the 25
Wards of the City of London
.

Geography
Main article:
Geography of England
Landscape and rivers
The
Malvern Hills
located in the English counties of
Worcestershire
and
Herefordshire
. The hills have been designated by the Countryside Agency as an
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
.
Geographically, England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the
Isle of Wight
and the
Isles of Scilly
. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom:
to the north
by Scotland and
to the west
by Wales.
England is closer than any other part of mainland Britain to the European continent. It is separated from
France
(
Hauts-de-France
) by a 21-mile (34 km)
[104]
sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the
Channel Tunnel
near
Folkestone
.
[105]
England also has shores on the
Irish Sea
,
North Sea
and Atlantic Ocean.
The ports of London,
Liverpool
, and
Newcastle
lie on the tidal rivers
Thames
,
Mersey
and
Tyne
respectively. At 220 miles (350 km), the
Severn
is the longest river flowing through England.
[106]
It empties into the
Bristol Channel
and is notable for its
Severn Bore
(a
tidal bore
), which can reach 2 metres (6.6 ft) in height.
[107]
However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is 215 miles (346 km) in length.
[108]
The village of
Glenridding
and
Ullswater

Cumbria
.
There are many
lakes in England
; the largest is
Windermere
, within the aptly named
Lake District
.
[109]
Most of England's landscape consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west of the country. The northern uplands include the
Pennines
, a chain of uplands dividing east and west, the Lake District mountains in Cumbria, and the
Cheviot Hills
, straddling the border between England and Scotland. The highest point in England, at 978 metres (3,209 ft), is
Scafell Pike
in the Lake District.
[109]
The
Shropshire Hills
are near Wales while
Dartmoor
and
Exmoor
are two upland areas in the south-west of the country. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the
Tees-Exe line
.
[110]
The Pennines, known as the "backbone of England", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the
Paleozoic Era
around 300 million years ago.
[111]
Their geological composition includes, among others,
sandstone
and
limestone
, and also coal. There are
karst
landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of
Yorkshire
and
Derbyshire
. The Pennine landscape is high
moorland
in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain two
national parks
, the
Yorkshire Dales
and the
Peak District
. In the
West Country
, Dartmoor and Exmoor of the Southwest Peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite.
[112]
The
English Lowlands
are in the central and southern regions of the country, consisting of green rolling hills, including the
Cotswold Hills
,
Chiltern Hills
,
North
and
South Downs
; where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the
cliffs of Dover
. This also includes relatively flat plains such as the
Salisbury Plain
,
Somerset Levels
,
South Coast Plain
and
The Fens
.
Climate
Main article:
Climate of England
England has a
temperate
maritime climate
: it is mild with temperatures not much lower than 0 °C (32 °F) in winter and not much higher than 32 °C (90 °F) in summer.
[113]
The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the
English coast
, while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October.
[113]
Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.
Important influences on the climate of England are its proximity to the
Atlantic Ocean
, its northern
latitude
and the warming of the sea by the
Gulf Stream
.
[113]
Rainfall is higher in the west, and parts of the
Lake District
receive more rain than anywhere else in the country.
[113]
Since weather records began, the highest temperature recorded was 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) on 19 July 2022 at
Coningsby
,
Lincolnshire
,
[114]
while the lowest was −26.1 °C (−15.0 °F) on 10 January 1982 in
Edgmond
, Shropshire.

[116]
The fauna of England is similar to that of other areas in the
British Isles
with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of habitats.
[117]
National nature reserves in England
are designated by
Natural England
as key places for
wildlife
and natural features in England. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of
The Wildlife Trusts
partnership, the
National Trust
, and the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
. There are 229 NNRs in England covering 939 square kilometres (363 square miles). Often they contain rare species or nationally important populations of plants and animals.
[118]
The
Environment Agency
is a non-departmental public body, established in 1995 and sponsored by the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
with responsibilities relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England.

The
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
is the minister responsible for environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in England.

[121]
England has a
temperate oceanic climate
in most areas, lacking extremes of cold or heat, but does have a few small areas of
subarctic
and warmer areas in
the South West
. Towards the
North of England
the climate becomes colder and most of England's mountains and high hills are located here and have a major impact on the climate and thus the local fauna of the areas.
Deciduous
woodlands are common across all of England and provide a great habitat for much of England's wildlife, but these give way in northern and upland areas of England to
coniferous
forests (mainly plantations) which also benefit certain forms of wildlife. Some species have adapted to the expanded urban environment, particularly the
red fox
, which is the most successful
urban mammal
after the
brown rat
, and other animals such as
common wood pigeon
, both of which thrive in urban and suburban areas.

The
Greater London Built-up Area
is by far the largest urban area in England
[123]
and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a
global city
and has a population larger than any other country in the United Kingdom besides England itself.
[123]
Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in
northern England
or the
English Midlands
.
[123]
There are
50 settlements
which have designated
city status in England
, while the wider United Kingdom has 66.
While many cities in England are quite large, such as
Birmingham
,
Sheffield
,
Manchester
,
Liverpool
,
Leeds
,
Newcastle
,
Bradford
,
Nottingham
, population size is not a prerequisite for city status.
[124]
Traditionally the status was given to towns with
diocesan cathedrals
, so there are smaller cities like
Wells
,

from the 17th century.
[139]
As the birthplace of the
Industrial Revolution
, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include
Isambard Kingdom Brunel
, best known for the creation of the
Great Western Railway
, a series of famous
steamships
, and numerous important bridges, revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering.
[140]
Thomas Newcomen
's

helped spawn the Industrial Revolution.
[141]
The Father of Railways,
George Stephenson
, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world, the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway
, which opened in 1830. With his role in the marketing and manufacturing of the steam engine, and invention of modern coinage,
Matthew Boulton
(business partner of
James Watt
) is regarded as one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history.

Transport
Main article:
Transport in England
The
Department for Transport
is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. The department is run by the
Secretary of State for Transport
.
England has a dense and modern transportation infrastructure. There are many
motorways in England
, and many other trunk roads, such as the
A1 Great North Road
, which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle
[154]
(much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the
M6
, from
Rugby
through the
North West
up to the
Anglo-Scottish border
, a distance of 232 miles (373 km).
[154]
Other major routes include: the
M1
from London to Leeds, the
M25
which encircles London, the
M60
which encircles Manchester, the
M4
from London to South Wales, the
M62
from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the
M5
from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.
[154]
London St Pancras International
is one of London's main domestic and international transport hubs providing both commuter rail and high-speed rail services across the UK and to Paris,
Lille
and
Brussels
.
Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include
Arriva
,
FirstGroup
,
Go-Ahead Group
,
Mobico Group
,
Rotala
and
Stagecoach Group
.
Bus Rapid Transit
originated in England with the
Runcorn
Busway opening in 1971.
[155]
[156]
The red
double-decker buses
in London have become a symbol of England.
National Cycle Route
offers cycling routes nationally.
Rail transport in England
is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825.
[157]
Much of Britain's 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the
Channel Tunnel
, which was completed in 1994.
Great British Railways
is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee
rail transport in Great Britain
from 2024. The
Office of Rail and Road
is responsible for the economic and safety regulation of England's railways.
[158]
Crossrail
was Europe's largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost, opened in 2022.
[159]
High Speed 2
, a new high-speed north-south railway line, is under construction.
[160]
There is a
rapid transit
network in two English cities: the
London Underground
, and the
Tyne and Wear Metro
in
Newcastle upon Tyne
,
Gateshead
and
Sunderland
.
[161]
There are several extensive tram networks, such as the
Manchester Metrolink
,
Sheffield Supertram
,
West Midlands Metro
,
Nottingham Express Transit
, and
Tramlink
in South London.
[161]
England also has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is
Heathrow
, which is the
world's second busiest airport measured by number of international passengers
.
[162]
By sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including from Liverpool to Ireland and the Isle of Man, and Hull to the Netherlands and Belgium.
[163]
There are around 4,400 miles (7,100 km) of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by the
Canal & River Trust
,
[163]
however, water transport is very limited. The
River Thames
is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the
Port of Tilbury
in the
Thames Estuary
, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.

[164]
[165]
Successive governments have outlined numerous commitments to reduce
carbon dioxide
emissions. Notably, the UK is
one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy
, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply.
[165]
Wind power contributed 26.8% of UK electricity generation in 2022.
[166]
England is home to
Hornsea 2
, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, situated in waters roughly 89 kilometres off the coast of Yorkshire.
[167]
The
Climate Change Act 2008
was passed in Parliament with an overwhelming majority across political parties. It sets out emission reduction targets that the UK must comply with legally. It represents the first global legally binding climate change mitigation target set by a country.
[168]
UK government energy policy
aims to play a key role in limiting
greenhouse gas emissions
, while meeting energy demand. Shifting availabilities of resources and development of technologies also change the country's
energy mix
through changes in costs.
[169]
The current energy policy is the responsibility of the
Department for Energy Security and Net Zero
and
Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero
.
[170]
The
Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth
is responsible for green finance, climate science and innovation, and low carbon generation.
[171]
In 2022, the United Kingdom was ranked 2 out of 180 countries in the
Environmental Performance Index
.
[172]
A law has been passed that
UK greenhouse gas emissions
will be
net zero
by 2050.

Healthcare
Main article:
Healthcare in England
William Beveridge
's 1942 report
Social Insurance and Allied Services
served as the basis for the post-
World War II
welfare state
.
The
National Health Service
(NHS), is the publicly funded
healthcare system
responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the
National Health Service Act 1946
. It was based on the findings of the
Beveridge Report
, prepared by economist and social reformer
William Beveridge
.
[174]
The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including
National Insurance
payments,
[175]
and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.
[176]
The government department responsible for the NHS is the
Department of Health
, headed by the
Secretary of State for Health
. Most of the expenditure of the department is spent on the NHS—£98.6 billion was spent in 2008-2009.
[177]
Regulatory bodies such as the
General Medical Council
and the
Nursing and Midwifery Council
are organised on a UK-wide basis, as are non-governmental bodies such as the
Royal Colleges
.
The average
life expectancy
is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four
countries of the United Kingdom
.
[178]
The south of England has a higher life expectancy than the north, but regional differences seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991-1993 and 2012-2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years.

With over 56 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total.
[179]
England taken as a unit and measured against international states would be the 25th largest
country by population
in the world.
[180]
The

[181]
There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the
United States
,
Canada
,
Australia
,
South Africa
and
New Zealand
.
[c]
Since the late 1990s, many English people
have migrated
to Spain.
[186]
Due in particular to the economic prosperity of
South East England
, it has received many economic migrants from the other parts of the United Kingdom.
[181]
There has been
significant Irish migration
.
[187]
The proportion of ethnically European residents totals at 87.50%, including
Germans
[188]
and
Poles
.
[181]
Other people from much further afield in the former British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% of people living in England have family origins in the
Indian subcontinent
, mostly
India
,
Pakistan
and
Bangladesh
.
[181]
[188]
About 0.7% are Chinese.
[181]
[188]
2.90% of the population are black, from Africa and the
Caribbean
, especially former British colonies.
[181]
[188]
In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from
ethnic minority
families,
[189]
and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%.
[190]
About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration.
[191]
England contains one indigenous national minority, the
Cornish people
, recognised by the UK government under the
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities
in 2014.

[194]
Due in large part to the
British Empire
, the English language is the world's unofficial
lingua franca
.
[195]
English language learning and teaching
is an important
economic activity
, and includes
language schooling
, tourism spending, and publishing. There is no
legislation
mandating an
official language
for England,
[196]
but English is the only language used for official business. Despite the country's relatively small size, there are many distinct
regional accents
, and individuals with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood everywhere in the country.
As well as English, England has two other
indigenous languages
,
Cornish
and
Welsh
. Cornish died out as a community language in the 18th century but is being revived,
[197]
and is now protected under the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
.
[198]
It is spoken by 0.1% of people in
Cornwall
,
[199]
and is taught to some degree in several primary and secondary schools.
[200]
State schools
teach students a
second language
or
third language
from the ages of seven, most commonly French, Spanish or German.
[201]
It was reported in 2007 that around 800,000 school students spoke a
foreign language
at home,
[189]
the most common being
Punjabi
and
Urdu
. However, following the 2011 census data released by the
Office for National Statistics
, figures now show that Polish is the main language spoken in England after English.

Further information:
History of Christianity in England
In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were
Muslim
, while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer.
[204]
Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England. The
established church
of England is the
Church of England
,
[205]
which left communion with
Rome
in the 1530s when
Henry VIII
was unable to annul his marriage to
Catherine of Aragon
. The church regards itself as both Catholic and
Protestant
.
[206]
There are
High Church
and
Low Church
traditions and some Anglicans regard themselves as
Anglo-Catholics
, following the
Tractarian movement
. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the
supreme governor of the Church of England
, which has around 26 million baptised members (of whom the vast majority are not regular churchgoers). It forms part of the
Anglican Communion
with the
Archbishop of Canterbury
acting as its symbolic worldwide head.
[207]
Many
cathedrals
and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as
Westminster Abbey
,
York Minster
,
Durham Cathedral
, and
Salisbury Cathedral
.
Westminster Abbey
is a notable example of
English Gothic architecture
. The
coronation of the British monarch
traditionally takes place at the Abbey.
The second-largest Christian denomination is the
Catholic Church
. Since its reintroduction after the
Catholic Emancipation
, the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an
England and Wales
basis where there are 4.5 million members (most of whom are English).
[208]
There has been one Pope from England to date,
Adrian IV
, while saints
Bede
and
Anselm
are regarded as
Doctors of the Church
.
A form of
Protestantism
known as
Methodism
is the third largest Christian practice and grew out of Anglicanism through
John Wesley
.
[209]
It gained popularity in the
mill towns
of
Lancashire
and
Yorkshire
, and among tin miners in
Cornwall
.
[210]
There are other
non-conformist
minorities, such as
Baptists
,
Quakers
,
Congregationalists
,
Unitarians
and
The Salvation Army
.
[211]
The patron saint of England is
Saint George
; his symbolic cross is included in the flag of England.
[212]
There are many other English and associated saints, including
Cuthbert
,
Edmund
,
Alban
,
Wilfrid
,
Aidan
,
Edward the Confessor
,
John Fisher
,
Thomas More
,
Petroc
,
Piran
,
Margaret Clitherow
and
Thomas Becket
. There are non-Christian religions practised.
Jews
have a history of a small minority on the island since 1070.
[213]
They were expelled from England in 1290 following the
Edict of Expulsion
, and were allowed back in 1656.
[213]
Especially since the 1950s, religions from the
former British colonies
have grown in numbers, due to immigration.
Islam
is the most common of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England.
[214]
Hinduism
,
Sikhism
and
Buddhism
are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined,
[214]
introduced from India and
South East Asia
.
[214]
A small minority of the population practise ancient
Pagan religions
.
Neopaganism in the United Kingdom
is primarily represented by
Wicca
and
Neopagan witchcraft
,
Druidry
, and
Heathenry
. According to the
2011 census
, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England,
[d]
including 11,026
Wiccans
.
[e]
24.7% of people in England declared
no religion

State-funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren.
[217]
Education is the responsibility of the
Secretary of State for Education
.
[218]
Children between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an
Early Years Foundation Stage
reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. State-funded schools are obliged by law to teach the
National Curriculum
; basic areas of learning include English literature, English language, mathematics, science, art & design, citizenship, history, geography, religious education, design & technology, computing, ancient & modern languages, music, and physical education.
[219]
The
University of Oxford
was founded in 1096, making it the world's second-oldest university.
The
Programme for International Student Assessment
coordinated by the
OECD
currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in literacy, mathematics, and science with the average British student scoring 503.7, well above the OECD average of 493.
[220]
Although most English secondary schools are comprehensive, there are selective intake
grammar schools
to which entrance is subject to passing the
eleven-plus
exam. Around 7.2 per cent of English schoolchildren attend
private schools
, which are funded by private sources.
[221]
Standards in state schools are monitored by the
Office for Standards in Education
, and in private schools by the
Independent Schools Inspectorate
.
[222]
After finishing compulsory education, students take
GCSE
examinations. Students may then opt to continue into
further education
for two years.
Further education colleges
(particularly
sixth form colleges
) often form part of a secondary school site.
A-level
examinations are sat by a large number of further education students, and often form the basis of an application to university. Further education covers a wide curriculum of study and
apprenticeships
, including
T-levels
,
BTEC
,
NVQ
and others.
Tertiary colleges
provide both academic and vocational courses.
[223]
Higher education
Higher education students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an
academic degree
. There are over 90 universities in England, all but one of which are
public institutions
. The
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
is the government department responsible for higher education in England.
[224]
Students are generally entitled to
student loans
to cover
tuition fees
and living costs.
[f]
The first degree offered to undergraduates is the
bachelor's degree
, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or a doctorate, which takes three or more years.
[226]
England's universities
include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world. As of 2023, four England-based universities, the
University of Cambridge
,
University of Oxford
,
Imperial College London
, and
University College London
, are ranked among the top ten in the 2023
QS World University Rankings
. The University of Cambridge, founded in 1209, and the University of Oxford, founded in 1096, are the two
oldest universities in the English-speaking world
.
[227]
The
London School of Economics
has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.
[228]
The
London Business School
is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the
Financial Times
.
[229]
Academic degrees
in England are usually split into classes: first class, upper second class, lower second class, third, and unclassified.
[226]
The King's School, Canterbury
and
King's School, Rochester
are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world.

It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known example is
Hadrian's Wall
stretching right across northern England.
[233]
Another well-preserved example is the
Roman Baths
at
Bath, Somerset

[233]
Bodiam Castle
is a 14th-century

Robertsbridge
in East Sussex.
Early medieval architecture
's secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with
thatch
for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of
Hiberno
-
Saxon
monasticism
,
[234]
[235]
to
Early Christian
basilica
and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various
castles
were created; the best known include the
Tower of London
,
Warwick Castle
,
Durham Castle
and
Windsor Castle
.
[236]
Throughout the Plantagenet era, an
English Gothic architecture
flourished, with prime examples including the
medieval cathedrals
such as
Canterbury Cathedral
,
Westminster Abbey
and
York Minster
.
[236]
Expanding on the
Norman base
there was also
castles
,
palaces
,
great houses
, universities and
parish churches
. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century
Tudor style
; the four-centred arch, now known as the
Tudor arch
, was a defining feature as were
wattle and daub
houses domestically. In the aftermath of the
Renaissance
a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the
English Baroque
style of architect
Christopher Wren
being particularly championed.
[237]
Georgian architecture
followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the
Royal Crescent
at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of
romanticism
during Victorian period, a
Gothic Revival
was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as
The Crystal Palace
. Since the 1930s various
modernist
forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.

Gardens
Main article:
English garden
The landscape garden at Stourhead. Inspired by the great
landscape artists
of the seventeenth century, the landscape garden was described as a "living work of art" when first opened in the 1750s.
[239]
Landscape gardening, as developed by
Capability Brown
, set an international trend for the
English landscape garden
. Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples,
Gothic
ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape.
[240]
By the end of the 18th century, the English garden was being imitated by the
French landscape garden
, and as far away as
Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg
, the gardens of the future
Emperor Paul
. It also had a major influence on the
public parks
and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.
[241]
The English landscape garden was centred on the
English country house
and manor houses.
[240]
English Heritage
and the
National Trust
preserve great gardens and landscape parks throughout the country.
[242]
The
RHS Chelsea Flower Show
is held every year by the
Royal Horticultural Society

Folklore
Main article:
English folklore
Robin Hood
and
Maid Marian
with
Richard I of England
English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include
pixies
,
giants
,
elves
,
bogeymen
,
trolls
,
goblins
and
dwarves
. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales featuring
Offa of Angel
and
Wayland the Smith
,
[244]
others date from after the Norman invasion. The legends featuring
Robin Hood
and his
Merry Men
of
Sherwood
, and their battles with the
Sheriff of Nottingham
, are among the best-known of these.
[245]
During the
High Middle Ages
tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore and developed into the
Arthurian myth
.
[246]
[247]
[248]
These were derived from
Anglo-Norman
, Welsh and French sources,
[247]
featuring
King Arthur
,
Camelot
,
Excalibur
,
Merlin
and the
Knights of the Round Table
such as
Lancelot
. These stories are most centrally brought together within
Geoffrey of Monmouth
's
Historia Regum Britanniae
(
History of the Kings of Britain
).
[h]
Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries.
[250]
On 5 November people celebrate
Bonfire Night
to commemorate the foiling of the
Gunpowder Plot
centred on
Guy Fawkes
. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as
Morris dancing
,
Maypole dancing
,
Rapper sword
in the North East,
Long Sword dance
in Yorkshire,
Mummers Plays
,
bottle-kicking
in Leicestershire, and
cheese-rolling
at

English cuisine
Fish and chips
is a traditionally popular dish in England.
Since the
early modern period
the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce.
[253]
During the
Middle Ages
and the Renaissance, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the
Industrial Revolution
with increasing urbanisation. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by food critics with some good ratings in
Restaurant

World War I
(
WWI
), also known as the
First World War
, was a
global conflict
fought between two coalitions, the
Allied Powers
and the
Central Powers
. Fighting took place throughout
Europe
, the
Middle East
,
Africa
, the
Pacific
, and parts of
Asia
. One of the
deadliest wars in history
, it resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23 million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various causes. Millions more died as a result of
genocide
, and the war was a major factor in the 1918
Spanish flu
pandemic.
The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers. This reached a
breaking point
on 28 June 1914, when a
Bosnian Serb
named
Gavrilo Princip
assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand
, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
Austria-Hungary
held
Serbia
responsible, and declared war on 28 July.
Russia
came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August,
Germany
,
France
, and
Britain
were drawn into the war, with the
Ottoman Empire
joining in November of that same year.
Germany's strategy in 1914
was to first defeat France, then transfer forces to the Russian front. However, this
failed
, and by the end of 1914, the
Western Front
consisted of a continuous line of
trenches
stretching from the
English Channel
to
Switzerland
. The
Eastern Front
was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. As the war expanded to more fronts,
Bulgaria
,
Romania
,
Greece
,
Italy
and others joined in from 1915 onward.
In early 1917, the
United States entered the war
on the side of the Allies, and later the same year, the
Bolsheviks
seized power in the Russian
October Revolution
, making
peace
with the Central Powers in early 1918. Germany launched an
offensive
in the west in March 1918, and despite initial success, it left the
German Army
exhausted and demoralised. A successful Allied
counter-offensive
later that year caused a collapse of the German frontline. By the end of 1918, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary agreed to armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing
revolution
at home and with his army on the verge of mutiny,
Kaiser Wilhelm II
abdicated on 9 November.
Fighting ended with the
Armistice of 11 November 1918
, while the subsequent
Paris Peace Conference
imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, notably the
Treaty of Versailles
. The dissolution of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires resulted in the creation of new independent states, including
Poland
,
Finland
,
Czechoslovakia
, and
Yugoslavia
. The inability to manage
post-war instability
contributed
to the outbreak of
World War II
in September 1939.
Names
The term
world war
was first coined in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher
Ernst Haeckel
. He claimed that "there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"
[1]
in
The Indianapolis Star
on 20 September 1914.
The term
First World War
had been used by Lt-Col.
Charles à Court Repington
, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of
Harvard University
in his diary entry of 10 September 1918.
[2]
[3]
Prior to
World War II
, the events of 1914-1918 were generally known as the
Great War
or simply the
World War
.
[4]
In August 1914, the magazine
The Independent
wrote "This is the Great War. It names itself".
[5]
In October 1914, the Canadian magazine
Maclean's
similarly wrote, "Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War."
[6]
Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as "
the war to end war
" and it was also described as "
the war to end all wars
" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.

Political and military alliances
For much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous
balance of power
among themselves, known as the
Concert of Europe
.
[8]
After 1848, this was challenged by a variety of factors, including Britain's withdrawal into so-called
splendid isolation
, the
decline of the Ottoman Empire
,
New Imperialism
, and the rise of
Prussia
under
Otto von Bismarck
. The 1866
Austro-Prussian War
established Prussian hegemony in
Germany
, while victory in the 1870-1871
Franco-Prussian War
allowed Bismarck to
consolidate
the German states into a
German Empire
under Prussian leadership. Avenging the defeat of 1871, or
revanchism
, and recovering the provinces of
Alsace-Lorraine
became the principal objects of French policy for the next forty years.
[9]
Rival military coalitions in 1914:
[k]
Triple Entente
Triple Alliance
In order to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the
League of the Three Emperors
(German:
Dreikaiserbund
) between
Austria-Hungary
,
Russia
and Germany. After Russian victory in the 1877-1878
Russo-Turkish War
, the League was dissolved due to Austrian concerns over Russian influence in the
Balkans
, an area they considered of vital strategic interest. Germany and Austria-Hungary then formed the 1879
Dual Alliance
, which became the
Triple Alliance
when Italy joined in 1882.
[10]
For Bismarck, the purpose of these agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three Empires resolved any disputes between themselves; when this was threatened in 1880 by British and French attempts to negotiate directly with Russia, he reformed the League in 1881, which was renewed in 1883 and 1885. After the agreement lapsed in 1887, he replaced it with the
Reinsurance Treaty
, a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.
[11]
Bismarck viewed peace with Russia as the foundation of German foreign policy but after becoming
Kaiser
in 1890,
Wilhelm II
forced him to retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by his new
Chancellor
,
Leo von Caprivi
.
[12]
This provided France an opportunity to counteract the Triple Alliance by signing the
Franco-Russian Alliance
in 1894, followed by the 1904
Entente Cordiale
with Britain. The
Triple Entente
was completed by the 1907
Anglo-Russian Convention
. While these were not formal alliances, by settling long-standing colonial disputes in
Africa
and
Asia
, the notion of British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia became a possibility.
[13]
British and Russian support for France against Germany during the
Agadir Crisis
in 1911 reinforced their relationship and increased Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would erupt in 1914.
[14]
Arms race
German industrial strength and production significantly increased after 1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich,
French indemnity
payments, and the annexation of
Alsace-Lorraine
. Backed by Wilhelm II, Admiral
Alfred von Tirpitz
sought to use this growth in economic power to build a
Kaiserliche Marine
, or
Imperial German Navy
, which could compete with the British
Royal Navy
for world naval supremacy.
[15]
His thinking was influenced by US naval strategist
Alfred Thayer Mahan
, who argued possession of a
blue-water navy
was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel.
[16]
However, it was also an emotional decision, driven by Wilhelm's simultaneous admiration for the Royal Navy and desire to outdo and surpass it. Bismarck thought that the British would not interfere in Europe, so long as its maritime supremacy remained secure, but his dismissal in 1890 led to a change in policy and an
Anglo-German naval arms race
began.
[17]
Despite the vast sums spent by Tirpitz, the launch of
HMS
Dreadnought
in 1906 gave the British a technological advantage over their German rivals which they never lost.
[15]
Ultimately, the race diverted huge resources into creating a German navy large enough to antagonise Britain, but not defeat it; in 1911, Chancellor
Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg
acknowledged defeat, leading to the
Rüstungswende
or 'armaments turning point', when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army.
[18]
SMS

, a
Nassau

Dreadnought
This decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions, but German concern over Russia's quick recovery from its defeat in the
Russo-Japanese War
and subsequent
1905 Russian Revolution
that same year. Economic reforms backed by funding from the French led to a significant post-1908 expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure, particularly in its western border regions.
[19]
Since Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to
Russia
, the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the Royal Navy. After Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 troops in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures were taken by the
Balkan powers
and Italy, which led to increased expenditure by the
Ottomans
and Austria-Hungary. Absolute figures are hard to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure, since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which also had logistical importance and military use. It is known, however, that from 1908 to 1913, military spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real terms.
[20]
Conflicts in the Balkans

Austrian annexation in 1908
The years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans as other powers sought to benefit from Ottoman decline. While
Pan-Slavic
and
Orthodox
Russia considered itself the protector of
Serbia
and other
Slav
states, they preferred the strategically vital
Bosporus
straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government, rather than an ambitious Slav power like
Bulgaria
. Since Russia had its own ambitions in northeastern
Anatolia
and their clients had over-lapping claims in the Balkans, balancing these divided Russian policy-makers and added to regional instability.
[21]
Austrian statesmen viewed the Balkans as essential for the continued existence of their Empire, and saw Serbian expansion as a direct threat. The 1908-1909
Bosnian Crisis
began when Austria annexed the former Ottoman territory of
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, which it
had occupied
since 1878. Timed to coincide with the
Bulgarian Declaration of Independence
from the Ottoman Empire, this unilateral action was denounced by the European powers, but accepted as there was no consensus on how to resolve the situation. Some historians see this as a significant escalation, ending any chance of Austria co-operating with Russia in the Balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations between Serbia and Italy, both of whom had their own expansionist ambitions in the region.
[22]
Tensions increased after the 1911-1912
Italo-Turkish War
demonstrated Ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the
Balkan League
, an alliance of Serbia, Bulgaria,
Montenegro
, and
Greece
.
[23]
The League quickly overran most of the Ottomans' territory in the Balkans during the 1912-1913
First Balkan War
, much to the surprise of outside observers.
[24]
The Serbian capture of ports on the
Adriatic
resulted in partial Austrian mobilisation starting on 21 November 1912, including units along the Russian border in
Galicia
. In a meeting the next day, the
Russian government
decided not to mobilise in response, unwilling to precipitate a war for which they were not as of yet prepared to handle.
[25]
The Great Powers sought to re-assert control through the 1913
Treaty of London
, which created an independent
Albania
, while enlarging the territories of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. However, disputes between the victors sparked the 33-day
Second Balkan War
, when Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913; it was defeated, losing most of
Macedonia
to Serbia and Greece, and
Southern Dobruja
to Romania.
[26]
The result was that even countries which benefited from the Balkan Wars, such as Serbia and Greece, felt cheated of their "rightful gains", while for Austria it demonstrated the apparent indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns, including Germany.
[27]
This complex mix of resentment, nationalism and insecurity helps explain why the pre-1914 Balkans became known as the "
powder keg of Europe
".

Sarajevo assassination
Main article:
Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
Traditionally thought to show the arrest of
Gavrilo Princip
(right),
this photo
is now believed by historians to depict an innocent bystander, Ferdinand Behr
[29]
[30]
On 28 June 1914,
Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
, heir presumptive to Emperor
Franz Joseph
, visited
Sarajevo
, capital of the recently annexed provinces of
Bosnia and Herzegovina
. Six assassins
[l]
from the movement known as
Young Bosnia
, or
Mlada Bosna
, took up positions along the route taken by the Archduke's motorcade, with the intention of assassinating him. Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian
Black Hand
intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule, although there was little agreement on what would replace it.
[32]
Nedeljko Čabrinović
threw a
grenade
at the Archduke's car and injured two of his aides, who were taken to hospital while the convoy carried on. The other assassins were also unsuccessful but an hour later, as Ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers, his car took a wrong turn into a street where
Gavrilo Princip
was standing. He stepped forward and fired two pistol shots, fatally wounding Ferdinand and his wife
Sophie
, who both died shortly thereafter.
[33]
Although Emperor Franz Joseph was shocked by the incident, political and personal differences meant the two men were not close; allegedly, his first reported comment was "A higher power has re-established the order which I, alas, could not preserve".
[34]
According to historian
Zbyněk Zeman
, his reaction was reflected more broadly in
Vienna
, where "the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On 28 and 29 June, the crowds listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."
[35]
Nevertheless, the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and has been described by historian
Christopher Clark
as a "
9/11 effect
, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna".
[36]
Expansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Crowds on the streets in the aftermath of the
anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo
, 29 June 1914
The Austro-Hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent
anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo
, in which
Bosnian Croats
and
Bosniaks
killed two
Bosnian Serbs
and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings.
[37]
[38]
Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. A further 460 Serbs were sentenced to death. A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the
Schutzkorps
was established and carried out the persecution of Serbs.

The assassination initiated the
July Crisis
, a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain. Believing Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz Ferdinand's murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this.
[43]
However, the
Foreign Ministry
had no solid proof of Serbian involvement and a dossier used to make its case was riddled with errors.
[44]
On 23
July, Austria delivered an
ultimatum
to Serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities.
[45]
Ethno-linguistic map of Austria-Hungary, 1910.
Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed
in 1908.
Serbia ordered general mobilisation on 25
July, but accepted all the terms, except for those empowering Austrian representatives to suppress "subversive elements" inside Serbia, and take part in the investigation and trial of Serbians linked to the assassination.
[46]
[47]
Claiming this amounted to rejection, Austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day; on 28 July, they declared war on Serbia and began shelling
Belgrade
. Having initiated war preparations on 25 July, Russia now ordered general mobilisation in support of Serbia on 30th.
[48]
Anxious to ensure backing from the
SPD
political opposition by presenting Russia as the aggressor, German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg delayed commencement of war preparations until 31 July.
[49]
That afternoon the Russian government were handed a note requiring them to "cease all war measures against Germany and Austria-Hungary" within 12 hours.
[50]
A further German demand for neutrality was refused by the French who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war.
[51]
The
German General Staff
had long assumed they faced a war on two fronts; the
Schlieffen Plan
envisaged using 80% of the army to defeat France in the west, then switch to Russia. Since this required them to move quickly, mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon.
[52]
Cheering crowds in
London
and
Paris
on the day war was declared.
At a meeting on 29 July, the British cabinet had narrowly decided its obligations to Belgium under the 1839
Treaty of London
did not require it to oppose a German invasion with military force. However, this was largely driven by Prime Minister
Asquith
's desire to maintain unity; he and his senior Cabinet ministers were already committed to support France, the Royal Navy had been mobilised and public opinion was strongly in favour of intervention.
[53]
On 31 July, Britain sent notes to Germany and France, asking them to respect Belgian neutrality; France pledged to do so, Germany did not reply.
[54]
Once the German ultimatum to Russia expired on the morning of 1 August, the two countries were at war. Later the same day, Wilhelm was informed by his ambassador in London,
Prince Lichnowsky
, that Britain would remain neutral if France was not attacked, and might not intervene at all given the ongoing
Home Rule Crisis
in
Ireland
.
[55]
Jubilant at this news, he ordered General
Moltke
, the German chief of staff, to "march the whole of the
... army to the East". This allegedly brought Moltke to the verge of a nervous breakdown, who protested that "it cannot be done. The deployment of millions cannot be improvised."
[56]
Lichnowsky soon realised he was mistaken, although Wilhelm insisted on waiting for a telegram from his cousin
George V
; once received it confirmed there had been a misunderstanding, and he told Moltke, "Now do what you want."
[57]
Aware of German plans to attack through Belgium, French Commander-in-Chief
Joseph Joffre
asked his government for permission to cross the border and pre-empt such a move. To avoid a violation of Belgian neutrality, he was told any advance could come only after a German invasion.
[58]
On 2 August,
Germany occupied Luxembourg
and exchanged fire with French units; on 3
August, they declared war on France and demanded free passage across Belgium, which was refused. Early on the morning of 4
August, the Germans invaded and
Albert I of Belgium
called for assistance under the
Treaty of London
.
[59]
[60]
Britain sent Germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from Belgium; when this expired at midnight without a response, the two empires were at war.
[61]

Diplomatic history of World War I
Opening hostilities
Confusion among the Central Powers
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.
[62]
Serbian campaign
Main article:
Serbian campaign
Serbian Army
Blériot XI
"Oluj", 1915
Beginning on 12 August, the Austrian and Serbs clashed at the battles of the
Cer
and
Kolubara
; over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses, dashing their hopes of a swift victory and marking the first major Allied victories of the war. As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.
[63]
Serbia's defeat of the 1914 invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century.
[64]
In spring 1915, the campaign saw the first use of
anti-aircraft warfare
after an Austrian plane was shot down with
ground-to-air
fire, as well as the first
medical evacuation
by the Serbian army in autumn 1915.
[65]
[66]
German offensive in Belgium and France
Main article:
Great Retreat
German soldiers on the way to the front in 1914; at this stage, all sides expected the conflict to be a short one.
Upon mobilisation in 1914, 80% of the
German Army
was located on the Western Front, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East; officially titled
Aufmarsch II West,
it is better known as the
Schlieffen Plan
after its creator,
Alfred von Schlieffen
, head of the
German General Staff
from 1891 to 1906. Rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier, the German right wing would sweep through the
Netherlands
and
Belgium
, then swing south, encircling Paris and trapping the French army against the Swiss border. Schlieffen estimated this would take six weeks, after which the German army would transfer to the East and defeat the Russians.
[67]
The plan was substantially modified by his successor,
Helmuth von Moltke the Younger
. Under Schlieffen, 85% of German forces in the west were assigned to the right wing, with the remainder holding along the frontier. By keeping his left wing deliberately weak, he hoped to lure the French into an offensive into the "lost provinces" of
Alsace-Lorraine
, which was in fact the strategy envisaged by their
Plan XVII
.
[67]
However, Moltke grew concerned the French might push too hard on his left flank and as the German Army increased in size from 1908 to 1914, he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings from 85:15 to 70:30.
[68]
He also considered Dutch neutrality essential for German trade and cancelled the incursion into the Netherlands, which meant any delays in Belgium threatened the entire viability of the plan.
[69]
Historian
Richard Holmes
argues these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success and thus led to unrealistic goals and timings.
[70]
French bayonet charge during the
Battle of the Frontiers
; by the end of August, French casualties exceeded 260,000, including 75,000 dead.
The initial German advance in the West was very successful and by the end of August the Allied left, which included the
British Expeditionary Force
(BEF), was in
full retreat
. At the same time, the French offensive in Alsace-Lorraine was a disastrous failure, with casualties exceeding 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the
Battle of the Frontiers
.
[71]
German planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914,
von Kluck
used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the German armies as they closed on Paris.
[72]
In 1911, the Russian
Stavka
had agreed with the French to attack Germany within fifteen days of mobilisation, ten days before the Germans had anticipated, although it meant the two Russian armies that entered
East Prussia
on 17 August did so without many of their support elements.
[73]
By the end of 1914, German troops held strong defensive positions inside France, controlled the bulk of France's domestic coalfields and had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. However, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a decisive outcome, while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.
[74]
As was apparent to a number of German leaders, this amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the Marne,
Crown Prince Wilhelm
told an American reporter; "We have lost the war. It will go on for a long time but lost it is already."

. On 10 August, German forces in
South-West Africa
attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The German colonial forces in

.
Prior to the war, Germany had attempted to use Indian nationalism and pan-Islamism to its advantage, a policy continued post-1914 by
instigating uprisings in India
, while the
Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition
urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers. However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity.
[80]
[81]
This was largely because leaders from the
Indian National Congress
and other groups believed support for the British war effort would hasten
Indian Home Rule
, a promise allegedly made explicit in 1917 by
Edwin Montagu
, then
Secretary of State for India
.
[82]
In 1914, the
British Indian Army
was larger than the British Army itself, and between 1914 and 1918 an estimated 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the
Government of India
and their
princely allies
supplied large quantities of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000 soldiers served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East, with 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded.
[83]
The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the British government to grant self-government to India after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and resulted in
the campaign for full independence
led by
Mahatma Gandhi
.

Western Front 1914 to 1916
Main article:
Western Front (World War I)
Trench warfare begins
British Indian soldiers

Laventie
, France, 1915
Pre-war military tactics that emphasised open warfare and the individual rifleman proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in 1914. Technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances, such as
barbed wire
,
machine guns
and above all far more powerful
artillery
, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult.
[85]
Both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without suffering heavy casualties. In time, however, technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons, such as
gas warfare
and the
tank
.
[86]
After the
First Battle of the Marne
in September 1914, Allied and German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the "
Race to the Sea
". By the end of 1914, the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the
Channel
to the Swiss border.
[87]
Since the Germans were normally able to choose where to stand, they generally held the high ground, while their trenches tended to be better built; those constructed by the French and English were initially considered "temporary", only needed until an offensive would smash the German defences.
[88]
Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the
Second Battle of Ypres
, the Germans (violating the
Hague Convention
) used
chlorine
gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, it became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.
[89]
[90]
Continuation of trench warfare
German casualties at the Somme, 1916
In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the
Battle of Verdun
, lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000
[91]
to 975,000
[92]
casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice.
[93]
The
Battle of the Somme
was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The
opening day
on 1 July 1916 was the bloodiest single day in the history of the
British Army
, which suffered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. As a whole, the Somme offensive led to an estimated 420,000 British casualties, along with 200,000 French and 500,000 German.
[94]
Gun fire was not the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as
trench foot
,
shell shock
, blindness/burns from
mustard gas
,
lice
,
trench fever
, "
cooties
" (
body lice
) and the '
Spanish flu

Naval war
Main article:
Naval warfare of World War I
Battleships of the
Hochseeflotte
, 1917
At the start of the war, German
cruisers
were scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied
merchant shipping
. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the light cruiser
SMS
Emden
, which was part of the German
East Asia Squadron
stationed at Qingdao, seized or sank 15 merchantmen, as well as a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. Most of the squadron was returning to Germany when it sank two British armoured cruisers at the
Battle of Coronel
in November 1914, before being virtually destroyed at the
Battle of the Falkland Islands
in December. The
SMS Dresden
escaped with a few auxiliaries, but after the
Battle of Más a Tierra
, these too had either been destroyed or interned.
[95]
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval
blockade of Germany
. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
[96]
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.
[97]
Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
[98]
The
Battle of Jutland
(German:
Skagerrakschlacht
, or "Battle of the
Skagerrak
") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war. It was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. The Kaiserliche Marine's
High Seas Fleet
, commanded by Vice Admiral
Reinhard Scheer
, fought the Royal Navy's
Grand Fleet
, led by Admiral Sir
John Jellicoe
. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.

[100]
The nature of
submarine warfare
meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.
[100]
[101]
The
United States
launched a protest, and Germany changed its rules of engagement. After the sinking of the passenger ship
RMS
Lusitania
in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the "
cruiser rules
", which demanded warning and movement of crews to "a place of safety" (a standard that lifeboats did not meet).
[102]
Finally, in early 1917, Germany adopted a policy of
unrestricted submarine warfare
, realising the Americans would eventually enter the war.
[100]
[103]
Germany sought to strangle Allied
sea lanes
before the United States could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.
[100]
The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in
convoys
, escorted by
destroyers
. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the
hydrophone
and
depth charges
were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.
[104]
The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.
[105]
World War I also saw the first use of
aircraft carriers
in combat, with
HMS
Furious
launching
Sopwith Camels
in a successful raid against the
Zeppelin
hangars at
Tondern
in July 1918, as well as

Faced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital,
Belgrade
. A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight
Italy
. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia.
[107]
The Austro-Hungarian provinces of
Slovenia
, Croatia and
Bosnia
provided troops for Austria-Hungary in the fight with Serbia, Russia and Italy. Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.
[108]
Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 14 October 1915 and joined in the attack by the Austro-Hungarian army under Mackensen's army of 250,000 that was already underway. Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern
Albania
. The Serbs suffered defeat in the
Battle of Kosovo
. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the
Battle of Mojkovac
in 6-7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.
[109]
After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.
[110]
In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at
Salonica
in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers. However, the pro-German
King Constantine I
dismissed the pro-Allied government of
Eleftherios Venizelos
before the Allied expeditionary force arrived.
[111]
The Macedonian front was initially mostly static. French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing
Bitola
on 19 November 1916 following the costly
Monastir offensive
, which brought stabilisation of the front.
[112]

Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918 in the
Vardar offensive
, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians were defeated at the
Battle of Dobro Pole
, and by 25 September British and French troops had crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September 1918.
[114]
The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to re-establish a front.
[115]
The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to
Budapest
and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the
Central Powers
and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.

The Ottomans threatened Russia's

Greek
, and
Assyrian
Christian populations, known as the
Armenian genocide
,

, and

respectively.
[117]
[118]
[119]
The British and French opened overseas fronts with the
Gallipoli
(1915) and
Mesopotamian campaigns
(1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French, and
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
(ANZACs). In
Mesopotamia
, by contrast, after the defeat of the British defenders in the
siege of Kut
by the Ottomans (1915-16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured
Baghdad
in March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and Assyrian fighters, while the Ottomans employed local
Kurdish
and
Turcoman
tribes.
[120]
Further to the west, the
Suez Canal
was defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at the
Battle of Romani
by the
ANZAC Mounted Division
and the
52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division
. Following this victory, an
Egyptian Expeditionary Force
advanced across the

and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917.

[122]
He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter. He lost 86% of his force at the
Battle of Sarikamish

Persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and Russian influence. The Ottomans and Germans were aided by

and
Azeri
forces, together with a large number of major Iranian tribes, such as the
Qashqai
,
Tangistanis
,
Lurs
, and

, while the Russians and British had the support of Armenian and Assyrian forces. The
Persian campaign
was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the Ottomans and their allies. However, the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern Mesopotamia.

Although Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882, a treaty with its traditional Austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in 1915.
[129]
This arose from
nationalist
designs on Austro-Hungarian territory in
Trentino
, the
Austrian Littoral
,
Rijeka
and
Dalmatia
, which were considered vital to secure the borders established in
1866
.
[130]
In 1902, Rome secretly agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany, effectively nullifying its role in the Triple Alliance.
[131]
Italian soldiers in trench, 1918
Austro-Hungarian trench at 3,850 metres in the
Ortler Alps
, one of the most challenging fronts of the war
When the war began in 1914, Italy argued the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature and it was not obliged to support an Austrian attack on Serbia. Opposition to joining the Central Powers increased when Turkey became a member in September, since in
1911
Italy had occupied Ottoman possessions in
Libya
and the
Dodecanese
islands.
[132]
To secure Italian neutrality, the Central Powers offered them the
French protectorate of Tunisia
, while in return for an immediate entry into the war, the Allies agreed to their demands for Austrian territory and sovereignty over the Dodecanese.
[133]
Although they remained secret, these provisions were incorporated into the April 1915
Treaty of London
; Italy joined the Triple Entente and on 23 May declared war on Austria-Hungary,
[134]
followed by Germany fifteen months later.
The pre-1914 Italian army was the weakest in Europe, short of officers, trained men, adequate transport and modern weapons; by April 1915, some of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for the major offensive required by the Treaty of London.
[135]
The advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain; much of the fighting took place at altitudes of over 3000 metres in the
Alps
and
Dolomites
, where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge. These issues were exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics.
[136]
Between 1915 and 1917, the Italian commander,
Luigi Cadorna
, undertook
a series of frontal assaults along the Isonzo
which made little progress and cost many lives; by the end of the war, total Italian combat deaths totalled around 548,000.
[137]
In the spring of 1916, the Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in
Asiago
in the
Strafexpedition
, but made little progress and were pushed by the Italians back to the Tyrol.
[138]
Although an Italian corps occupied southern
Albania
in May 1916, their main focus was the Isonzo front which after the
capture of Gorizia
in August 1916 remained static until October 1917. After a combined Austro-German force won a major victory at
Caporetto
, Cadorna was replaced by
Armando Diaz
who retreated more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) before holding positions along the
Piave River
.
[139]
A second Austrian
offensive was repulsed
in June 1918 and by October it was clear the Central Powers had lost the war. On 24 October, Diaz launched the
Battle of Vittorio Veneto
and initially met stubborn resistance,
[140]
but with Austria-Hungary collapsing, Hungarian divisions in Italy now demanded they be sent home.
[141]
When this was granted, many others followed and the Imperial army disintegrated, the Italians taking over 300,000 prisoners.
[142]
On 3
November, the
Armistice of Villa Giusti
ended hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Italy which occupied
Trieste
and areas along the
Adriatic Sea
awarded to it in 1915.

Romania key locations 1916-1918 (note; using 2022 borders)
Despite secretly agreeing to support the Triple Alliance in 1883, Romania increasingly found itself at odds with the Central Powers over their support for Bulgaria in the 1912 to 1913 Balkan Wars and the status of ethnic Romanian communities in
Hungarian
-controlled
Transylvania
,
[144]
which comprised an estimated 2.8 million of the 5.0 million population.
[145]
With the ruling elite split into pro-German and pro-Entente factions, Romania remained neutral in 1914, arguing like Italy that because Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia, it was under no obligation to join them.
[146]
They maintained this position for the next two years, while allowing Germany and Austria to transport military supplies and advisors across Romanian territory.
[147]
In September 1914, Russia had acknowledged Romanian rights to Austro-Hungarian territories including Transylvania and
Banat
, whose acquisition had widespread popular support,
[145]
and Russian success against Austria led Romania to join the Entente in the August 1916 Treaty of Bucharest.
[147]
Under the strategic plan known as
Hypothesis Z
, the Romanian army planned an offensive into Transylvania, while defending Southern
Dobruja
and
Giurgiu
against a possible Bulgarian counterattack.
[148]
On 27 August 1916, they
attacked Transylvania
and occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by the recently formed
German 9th Army
, led by former Chief of Staff Falkenhayn.
[149]
A combined German-Bulgarian-Turkish offensive captured Dobruja and Giurgiu, although the bulk of the Romanian army managed to escape encirclement and retreated to
Bucharest
, which
surrendered
to the Central Powers on 6 December 1916.
[150]

On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the
Treaty of Bucharest
with the Central Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany.
[151]
Although approved by
Parliament
,
Ferdinand I
refused to sign the treaty, hoping for an Allied victory; Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918.
[152]
[m]
Between 1914 and 1918, an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 ethnic Romanians served with the Austro-Hungarian army, of whom up to 150,000 were killed in action; total military and civilian deaths within contemporary Romanian borders are estimated at 748,000.
[154]
Eastern Front
Main article:
Eastern Front (World War I)
Initial actions
Emperor
Nicholas II
and
Grand Duke Nikolaevich
following the Russian
capture of Przemyśl
, the longest siege of the war.
As previously agreed with France, Russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into
Austrian Galicia
and East Prussia as soon as possible. Although their
attack on Galicia
was largely successful, and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing Germany to divert troops from the Western Front, the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions. These weaknesses contributed to Russian defeats at
Tannenberg
and the
Masurian Lakes
in August and September 1914, forcing them to withdraw from East Prussia with heavy losses.
[155]
[156]
By spring 1915, they had also retreated from Galicia, and the May 1915
Gorlice-Tarnów offensive
then allowed the Central Powers to invade
Russian-occupied Poland
.
[157]
Despite the successful June 1916
Brusilov offensive
against the Austrians in eastern Galicia,
[158]
shortages of supplies, heavy losses and command failures prevented the Russians from fully exploiting their victory. However, it was one of the most significant and impactful offensives of the war, diverting German resources from
Verdun
, relieving Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians, and convincing Romania to enter the war on the side of the Allies on 27 August. It also fatally weakened both the Austrian and Russian armies, whose offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and increased the disillusionment with the war that ultimately led to the Russian revolutions.
[159]
Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia as
the Tsar
remained at the front, with the home front controlled by
Empress Alexandra
. Her increasingly incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread protests and the murder of her favourite,
Grigori Rasputin
, at the end of 1916.
[160]
Central Powers peace overtures
"
They shall not pass
"
, a phrase typically associated with the defence of Verdun
On 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the
Battle of Verdun
and a
successful offensive against Romania
, Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies.
[161]
However, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a "duplicitous war ruse".
[161]
Soon after, US president
Woodrow Wilson
attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands and start negotiations.
Lloyd George's
War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.
[162]
This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united Poland".
[162]
On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.
[163]
The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.

Timeline of World War I (1917-1918)
Russian Revolution and withdrawal
Main articles:
Russian Revolution
,
February Revolution
, and
October Revolution
By the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices. In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress a wave of strikes in
Petrograd
but the troops refused to fire on the crowds.
[164]
Revolutionaries set up the
Petrograd Soviet
and fearing a left-wing takeover, the
State Duma
forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the
Russian Provisional Government
, which confirmed Russia's willingness to continue the war. However, the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband, creating
competing power centres
and caused confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised and unwilling to fight on.
[165]
Following the Tsar's abdication,
Vladimir Lenin
—with the help of the German government—was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia on 16 April 1917. Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led by Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
on 3
March 1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.
[166]
With the
Russian Empire
out of the war, Romania found itself alone on the Eastern Front and signed the
Treaty of Bucharest
with the Central Powers in May 1918, ending the state of war between Romania and the
Central Powers
. Under the terms of the treaty, Romania had to give territory to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, and lease its oil reserves to Germany. However, the terms also included the Central Powers recognition of the union of
Bessarabia
with Romania.

United States enters the war
Main article:
American entry into World War I
President Wilson
asking
Congress
to declare war on Germany, 2 April 1917
The United States was a major supplier of war materiel to the Allies but remained neutral in 1914, in large part due to domestic opposition.
[169]
The most significant factor in creating the support Wilson needed was the German submarine offensive, which not only cost American lives, but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea.
[170]
On 6 April 1917, Congress
declared war on Germany
as an "Associated Power" of the Allies.
[171]
The
United States Navy
sent a
battleship group
to
Scapa Flow
to join the Grand Fleet and provided convoy escorts. In April 1917, the
United States Army
had fewer than 300,000 men, including
National Guard
units, compared to British and French armies of 4.1 and 8.3 million respectively. The
Selective Service Act of 1917
drafted 2.8 million men, although training and equipping such numbers was a huge logistical challenge. By June 1918, over 667,000 members of the
American Expeditionary Forces
(AEF), had been transported to France, a figure which reached 2 million by the end of November.
[172]
Despite his conviction Germany must be defeated, Wilson went to war to ensure the US played a leading role in shaping the peace, which meant preserving the AEF as a separate military force, rather than being absorbed into British or French units as his Allies wanted.
[173]
He was strongly supported by AEF commander General
John J. Pershing
, a proponent of pre-1914 "open warfare" who considered the French and British emphasis on artillery as misguided and incompatible with American "offensive spirit".
[174]
Much to the frustration of his Allies, who had suffered heavy losses in 1917, he insisted on retaining control of American troops and refused to commit them to the front line until able to operate as independent units. As a result, the first significant US involvement was the
Meuse-Argonne offensive
in late September 1918.
[175]
Nivelle Offensive (April-May 1917)

Chemin des Dames
, April 1917
In December 1916,
Robert Nivelle
replaced Pétain as commander of French armies on the Western Front and began planning a
spring attack
in
Champagne
, part of a joint Franco-British operation. Nivelle claimed the capture of his main objective, the
Chemin des Dames
, would achieve a massive breakthrough and cost no more than 15,000 casualties.
[176]
Poor security meant German intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables, but despite this, when the attack began on 16 April the French made substantial gains, before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the Hindenburg Line. Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by 25 April the French had suffered nearly 135,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, most incurred in the first two days.

[178]
Operating as a separate unit for the first time, the
Canadian Corps
capture of
Vimy Ridge
during the battle is viewed by many Canadians as a defining moment in creating a sense of national identity.
[179]
[180]
Although Nivelle continued the offensive, on 3 May the
21st Division
, which had been involved in some of the heaviest fighting at Verdun, refused orders to go into battle, initiating the
French Army mutinies
; within days, acts of "collective indiscipline" had spread to 54 divisions, while over 20,000 deserted.
[181]
Unrest was almost entirely confined to the infantry, whose demands were largely non-political, including better economic support for families at home, and regular periods of leave, which Nivelle had ended.

and, early in December,
Jerusalem
was captured following another Ottoman defeat at the

.
[186]
[187]

About this time,
Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein
was relieved of his duties as the Eighth Army's commander, replaced by
Djevad Pasha
, and a few months later the commander of the
Ottoman Army
in Palestine,
Erich von Falkenhayn
, was replaced by
Otto Liman von Sanders
.

German offensive and Allied counter-offensive (March-November 1918)
Main articles:
German spring offensive
and
Hundred Days Offensive
In December 1917, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive.
[192]
Ludendorff drew up plans (
codenamed
Operation Michael
) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near
Saint-Quentin
. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (37 mi).
[193]
The initial offensive a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or
motorised artillery
, the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.
[194]
Between April and November 1918, the Allies increased their front-line rifle strength while German strength fell by half.
[195]
Following this, Germany launched
Operation Georgette
against the northern
English Channel
ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted
Operations Blücher and Yorck
, pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne (
Second Battle of the Marne
) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle
Reims
. The resulting counter-attack, which started the
Hundred Days Offensive
on 8 August,
[196]
caused a marked collapse in German morale.

In September, the Allies
advanced to the Hindenburg Line
in the north and centre. German forces launch numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the Line continued to fall, with the BEF alone taking 30,441 prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September, Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.
[200]
The
final assault
on the Hindenburg Line began with the
Meuse-Argonne offensive
, launched by American and French troops on 26 September. The following week, co-operating American and French units broke through in
Champagne
at the
Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge
, forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.

On 8
October the line was pierced again by British and Dominion troops at the
Battle of Cambrai

and near
Dojran Lake
. In the
Battle of Dobro Pole
, the Serbian and French armies had success after a three day long battle with relatively small casualties, and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front, something which was rarely seen in World War I. After the front was broken, Allied forces started to liberate Serbia and reached

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the
Armistice of Salonica
on 29 September 1918.
[205]
German Emperor
Wilhelm II
in a telegram to
Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I
described the situation thus: "Disgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!".
[206]
[207]
On the same day, the
German Supreme Army Command
informed
Kaiser Wilhelm II
and the
Imperial Chancellor
Count
Georg von Hertling
, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless.
[208]
On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3
November, Austria-Hungary sent a
flag of truce
to ask for an
armistice
(
Armistice of Villa Giusti
). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near
Padua
, on 3
November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the
Habsburg monarchy
. In the following days, the Italian Army occupied
Innsbruck
and all
Tyrol
with over 20,000 soldiers.
[209]
On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of Mudros.

, Kiel, 1918
In northern Germany, the
German Revolution of 1918-1919
began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The
sailors' revolt
, which then ensued in the naval ports of
Wilhelmshaven
and
Kiel
, spread across the whole country within days and led to the
proclamation of a republic
on 9
November 1918, shortly thereafter to the
abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II
, and to German surrender.

With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government on 3
October as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military.
[215]
There was no resistance when the
Social Democrat
Philipp Scheidemann
on 9
November
declared Germany to be a republic
. The Kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and Wilhelm fled to exile in the
Netherlands
. It was the end of Imperial Germany; a new Germany had been born as the
Weimar Republic
.

Aftermath
Main article:
Aftermath of World War I
In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.
[n]
Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the
Romanovs
, the
Hohenzollerns
, the
Habsburgs
, and the
Ottomans
. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4 million soldiers dead,
[217]
not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia were similarly affected.
[218]
Formal end of the war
The signing of the
Treaty of Versailles
in the
Hall of Mirrors
, Versailles, 28 June 1919, by Sir
William Orpen
A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the
Treaty of Versailles
with Germany on 28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it,
[219]
[220]
and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the
Knox-Porter Resolution
was signed on 2
July 1921 by President
Warren G. Harding
.
[221]
For the United Kingdom and the British Empire, the state of war ceased under the provisions of the
Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918
with respect to:
Germany on 10 January 1920.
[222]
Austria on 16 July 1920.
[223]
Bulgaria on 9 August 1920.
[224]

Some
war memorials
date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918.
[227]
Peace treaties and national boundaries
Map of
territorial changes in Europe
after World War
I (as of 1923)
After the war, there grew a certain amount of academic focus on the causes of war and on the elements that could make peace flourish. In part, these led to the institutionalization of peace and conflict studies, security studies and International Relations (IR) in general.
[228]
The
Paris Peace Conference
imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919
Treaty of Versailles
dealt with Germany and, building on
Wilson's 14th point
, brought into being the
League of Nations
on 28 June 1919.
[229]
[230]
The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement was
Article 231
. This article became known as the War Guilt clause as the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.
[231]
Overall the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the "
diktat
of Versailles". German historian Hagen Schulze said the Treaty placed Germany "under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."
[232]
Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s:
Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. The legend of the "
stab in the back
" and the wish to revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics. Even a man of peace such as [
Gustav
] Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt. As for the Nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the German nation into a spirit of revenge. Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.
[233]
Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours.
[234]
Dissolution of Austria-Hungary
after war
Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. Apart from Austria and Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia received territories from the Dual Monarchy (the formerly separate and autonomous
Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia
was incorporated into Yugoslavia). The details were contained in the
Saint-Germain-en-Laye
and the
Treaty of Trianon
. As a result, Hungary lost 64% of its total population, decreasing from 20.9 million to 7.6 million and losing 31% (3.3 out of 10.7 million) of its ethnic
Hungarians
.
[235]
According to the 1910 census, speakers of the Hungarian language included approximately 54% of the entire population of the
Kingdom of Hungary
. Within the country, numerous ethnic minorities were present: 16.1%
Romanians
, 10.5%
Slovaks
, 10.4%
Germans
, 2.5%
Ruthenians
, 2.5%
Serbs
and 8% others.
[236]
Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.
[237]
The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of
Estonia
,
Finland
,
Latvia
,
Lithuania
, and
Poland
were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April 1918.
[238]
National identities
Further information:
Sykes-Picot Agreement
After 123 years, Poland re-emerged as an independent country. The Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty, as a "minor Entente nation" and the country with the most casualties per capita,
[239]
[240]
[241]
became the backbone of a new multinational state, the
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes
, later renamed Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia, combining the
Kingdom of Bohemia
with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, became a new nation. Romania would
unite
all Romanian-speaking people under a single state leading to
Greater Romania
.
[242]
In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand, the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the
British Crown
, and independent national identities for these nations took hold.
Anzac Day
, commemorating the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), celebrates this defining moment.
[243]
[244]
In the aftermath of World War I, Greece
fought
against Turkish nationalists led by
Mustafa Kemal
, a war that eventually resulted in a
massive population exchange between the two countries
under the Treaty of Lausanne.
[245]
According to various sources,
[246]
several hundred thousand Greeks died during this period, which was tied in with the Greek genocide.
[247]

Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918,
8 million were killed
, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%.
[248]
France mobilised 7.8 million men, of which 1.4 million died and 3.2 million were injured.
[249]
Among the soldiers mutilated and surviving in the trenches, approximately 15,000 sustained horrific facial injuries, causing them to undergo social stigma and marginalisation; they were called the
gueules cassées
. In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. These excess deaths are estimated as 271,000 in 1918, plus another 71,000 in the first half of 1919 when the blockade was still in effect.
[250]
By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon.
[251]
Between 5
and 10 million people died in the
Russian famine of 1921
.
[252]
By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7
million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War
I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920-1922.
[253]
Numerous anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by the 1930s, the northern Chinese city of
Harbin
had 100,000 Russians.

Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. In 1914 alone, louse-borne
epidemic typhus
killed 200,000 in Serbia.
[255]
From 1918 to 1922, Russia had about 25 million infections and 3
million deaths from epidemic typhus.
[256]
In 1923, 13 million Russians contracted malaria, a sharp increase from the pre-war years.
[257]
Starting in early 1918, a major influenza epidemic known as
Spanish flu
spread around the world, accelerated by the movement of large number of soldiers, often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor sanitation. Overall, the Spanish flu killed at least 17 million to 25 million people,
[258]
[259]
including an estimated 2.64 million Europeans and as many as 675,000 Americans.
[260]
Moreover, between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of
encephalitis lethargica
spread around the world affecting nearly five million people.

Chemical weapons in warfare
Main article:
Chemical weapons in World War I
French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German trenches in Flanders
The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April - 25 May 1915), after German scientists working under the direction of
Fritz Haber
at the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
developed a method to weaponize
chlorine
.
[o]
[263]
The use of chemical weapons was sanctioned by the German High Command in an effort to force Allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons.
[263]
In time, chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately 1.3 million casualties, but relatively few fatalities: About 90,000 in total.
[263]
For example, there were an estimated 186,000 British chemical weapons casualties during the war (80% of which were the result of exposure to the
vesicant
sulfur mustard
, introduced to the battlefield by the Germans in July 1917, which burns the skin at any point of contact and inflicts more severe lung damage than chlorine or
phosgene
),
[263]
and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War
I.
[264]
The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the
1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases
and the
1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare
, which prohibited their use.

and published in 1918.
[267]
The
ethnic cleansing
of the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population, including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered
genocide
.
[268]
The Ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination.
[269]
In early 1915, a number of Armenians volunteered to join the Russian forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the
Tehcir Law
(Law on Deportation), which authorised the deportation of Armenians from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and 1918. The Armenians were intentionally
marched to death
and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands.
[270]
While an exact number of deaths is unknown, the
International Association of Genocide Scholars
estimates 1.5 million.
[268]
[271]
The government of Turkey has consistently
denied the genocide
, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War
I; these claims are rejected by most historians.
[272]
Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and
Greeks
, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination.
[273]
[274]
[275]
At least 250,000 Assyrian Christians, about half of the population, and 350,000-750,000
Anatolian
and
Pontic Greeks
were killed between 1915 and 1922.

The British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were
conscripted
into service. Surviving veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their experiences only amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed "veterans' associations" or "Legions". A small number of personal accounts of American veterans have been collected by the Library of Congress
Veterans History Project
.
[278]
Prisoners of war
Main article:
World War I prisoners of war in Germany
German prisoners in a French prison camp during the later part of the war
About eight million soldiers surrendered and were held in
POW camps
during the war. All nations pledged to follow the
Hague Conventions
on fair treatment of
prisoners of war
, and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.
[279]
25-31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status, for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4 million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5-3.5 million soldiers as prisoners). From the Central Powers about 3.3 million soldiers became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians.
[280]
The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.
[281]
[282]
Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War
II), thanks in part to the efforts of the
International Red Cross
and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia. Starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike. About 15-20% of the prisoners in Russia died, and in Central Powers imprisonment 8% of Russians.
[283]
In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.
[284]
[285]
[286]
British prisoners guarded by Ottoman forces after the
First Battle of Gaza
in 1917
The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly.
[287]
Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity.
[288]
Although many were in a poor condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march 1,100 kilometres (684 mi) to Anatolia. A survivor said: "We were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die."
[289]
The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the
Taurus Mountains
.
While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as
forced labour
, e.g., in France until 1920. They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the
Supreme War Council
.
[290]
German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.

Conscription was common in most European countries. However, it was controversial in English-speaking countries.
[292]
It was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland
[293]
and Australia,
[294]
[295]
and the French Catholics in Canada.
[296]
[297]
In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas.
[298]
The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower after only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1
million target in the first six weeks of the war.

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for
voting rights for women
.
[300]

In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from
Wall Street
. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916 but allowed a great increase in
US government
lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4
billion
[p]
of World War
I debt in 1934; the last installment was finally paid in 2015.
[301]
Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as
Albert Kitson
were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of
manganese
, used in munitions production, in the
Gold Coast
.
[302]
Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called "war guilt" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."
[303]
It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary. However, neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt."
[304]
In 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However, "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was to mislead public opinion ... into believing the "total sum was being maintained."
[305]
Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars) "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay" and "therefore … represented the total German reparations" figure that had to be paid.
[305]
This figure could be paid in cash or in-kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain.
[306]
By 1929, the
Great Depression
arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world.
[307]
In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point Germany had paid only the equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations.
[308]
With the rise of Adolf Hitler, all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled.
David Andelman
notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the Second World War, at the
London Conference
in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3
October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.
[q]
The Australian prime minister,
Billy Hughes
, wrote to the British prime minister,
David Lloyd George
, "You have assured us that you cannot get better terms. I much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies." Australia received £5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to Australia had been £376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were £831,280,947.
[313]
Of about 416,000 Australians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.
[218]
The war contributed to the evolution of the
wristwatch
from women's jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the
pocketwatch
, which requires a free hand to operate.
[314]
Trench watches
were designed for use by the military as pocket watches were not as effective for combat. Military funding of advancements in radio contributed to the post-war popularity of the medium.

In the Balkans,
Yugoslav nationalists
such as the leader,
Ante Trumbić
, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of
Yugoslavs
from Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia. The
Yugoslav Committee
, led by Trumbić, was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London.
[315]
In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including
Czechoslovak
,
Italian
,
Polish
,
Transylvanian
, and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to support national
self-determination
for the peoples residing within Austria-Hungary.
[316]
In the Middle East,
Arab nationalism
soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a
pan-Arab
state. In 1916, the Arab Revolt began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.
[317]
In East Africa,
Iyasu V
of
Ethiopia
was supporting the
Dervish state
who were at war with the British in the
Somaliland campaign
.
[318]
Von Syburg, the German envoy in
Addis Ababa
, said, "now the time has come for Ethiopia to regain the coast of the Red Sea driving the Italians home, to restore the Empire to its ancient size." The Ethiopian Empire was on the verge of entering World War
I on the side of the Central Powers before Iyasu's overthrow at the
Battle of Segale
due to Allied pressure on the Ethiopian aristocracy.
[319]
Iyasu was accused of converting to
Islam
.
[320]
According to Ethiopian historian
Bahru Zewde
, the evidence used to prove Iyasu's conversion was a doctored photo of Iyasu wearing a turban provided by the Allies.

Some historians claim the British spy
T. E. Lawrence
forged the Iyasu photo.

A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.
[316]
But European socialists split on national lines, with the concept of
class conflict
held by radical socialists such as Marxists and
syndicalists
being overborne by their patriotic support for the war.
[323]
Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.
[324]
Italian nationalism
was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was
Gabriele D'Annunzio
, who promoted
Italian irredentism
and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.
[325]
The
Italian Liberal Party
, under the leadership of
Paolo Boselli
, promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.
[326]
Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including
Benito Mussolini
and
Leonida Bissolati
.
[327]
However, the
Italian Socialist Party
decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a
general strike
called
Red Week
.
[328]
The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini.
[328]
Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist
Il Popolo d'Italia
and the
Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista
("Revolutionary
Fasci
for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the
Fasci Italiani di Combattimento
in 1919, the origin of fascism.
[329]
Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from
Ansaldo
(an armaments firm) and other companies to create
Il Popolo d'Italia
to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.
[330]
Patriotic Funds
On both sides there was large scale fundraising for soldiers' welfare, their dependents and for those injured. The
Nail Men
were a German example. Around the British empire there were many Patriotic Funds, including the
Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation
,
Canadian Patriotic Fund
,
Queensland Patriotic Fund
and, by 1919, there were 983 funds in New Zealand.
[331]
At the start of the next world war the New Zealand funds were reformed, having been criticised as overlapping, wasteful and abused,
[332]
but 11 were still functioning in 2002.

Espionage Act of 1917
and
Sedition Act of 1918
made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors,
[334]
and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced
Irish nationalists
staunchly opposed taking part.
[335]
The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the
Easter Rising
of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain.
[336]
The UK government placed Ireland under
martial law
in response to the Easter Rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling.
[337]
However, opposition to involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the
Conscription Crisis of 1918
.
Other opposition came from
conscientious objectors
—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight. In Britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.
[338]
Some of them, most notably prominent peace activist
Stephen Hobhouse
, refused both military and
alternative service
.
[339]
Many suffered years of prison, including
solitary confinement
and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors need apply".
[340]
On 1-4 May 1917, about 100,000 workers and soldiers of
Petrograd
, and after them, the workers and soldiers of other Russian cities, led by the Bolsheviks, demonstrated under banners reading "Down with the war!" and "all power to the soviets!" The mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the
Russian Provisional Government
.
[341]
In
Milan
, in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.
[342]
The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and
anarchists
, who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city. Almost 50 people (including three Italian soldiers) were killed and over 800 people arrested.

Technology

. In April 1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours.
[343]
World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century
tactics
, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone,
wireless communication
,
[344]
armoured cars
,
tanks
(especially with the advent of the first prototype tank,
Little Willie
), and aircraft.
[345]
Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917,
indirect fire
with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably, aircraft and the often overlooked
field telephone
.
[346]
Fixed-wing aircraft
were initially used for
reconnaissance
and
ground attack
. To shoot down enemy planes,
anti-aircraft guns
and
fighter aircraft
were developed.
Strategic bombers
were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used
Zeppelins
as well.
[347]
Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMS
Furious
launching
Sopwith Camels
in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at
Tønder
in 1918.

The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues:
propaganda campaigns
; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.

The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war; this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway more than a century later. Teaching World War I has presented special challenges. When compared with World War II, the First World War is often thought to be "a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons". It lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that characterizes the Second World War. Lacking recognizable heroes and villains, it is often taught thematically, invoking tropes like the wastefulness of war, the folly of generals and the innocence of soldiers. The complexity of the conflict is mostly obscured by these oversimplifications.
[352]
George Kennan
referred to the war as the "seminal catastrophe of the 20th century".
[354]
Historian Heather Jones argues that the
historiography
[
fr
]
has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, medical science, gender and mental health. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.

World War I had a lasting impact on
collective memory
. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the
Victorian period
, and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.
[363]
Historian
Samuel Hynes
explained:
A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.
[364]
This has become the most common perception of World War I, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. Films such as
All Quiet on the Western Front
,
Paths of Glory
and
King and Country
have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including
Camrades
,
Poppies of Flanders
, and
Shoulder Arms
indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.
[365]
Likewise, the art of
Paul Nash
,
John Nash
,
Christopher Nevinson
, and
Henry Tonks
in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as
Muirhead Bone
painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.
[364]
Several historians like
John Terraine
,
Niall Ferguson
and
Gary Sheffield
have challenged these interpretations as partial and
polemical
views:
These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War
I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.
[365]
Though these views have been discounted as "myths",
[364]
[366]
they are common. They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as "aimless" following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.
[365]
Writers such as
Ernest Hemingway
wrote many stories on the experiences of
veterans
after the war, such as the short story
Soldier's Home
, about young veteran Harold Krebs trying to integrate back into society.
[367]
Social trauma
A 1919 book for veterans, from the
US War Department
The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.
[368]
Over 8 million Europeans died in the war. Millions suffered permanent disabilities. The war gave birth to
fascism
and
Bolshevism
and destroyed the dynasties that had ruled the
Ottoman
,
Habsburg
,
Russian
and
German Empires
.
[352]
The
optimism
of
la belle époque
was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the
Lost Generation
.
[369]
For years afterward, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.
[370]
Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from
shell shock
(also called neurasthenia, a condition related to
post-traumatic stress disorder
).
[371]
Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman,
Paul Fussell
, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.
[368]
Discontent in Germany and Austria
The rise of
Nazism
and
fascism
included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the
stab-in-the-back legend
(German:
Dolchstoßlegende
) was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of the betrayal of the German war effort by Jews became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the "stab-in-the-back" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left. The same occurred in Austria which did not consider itself responsible for the outbreak of the war and claimed not to have suffered a military defeat.
[372]
Communist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war.
Adolf Hitler
was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles.
[373]
World War
II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War
I. Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War
I.
[374]
[375]
[376]
American historian
William Rubinstein
wrote that:
The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War
I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.

was a

located a mile from the

village of
Gresford
, near
Wrexham
.
History
[
edit
]
Sinking
[
edit
]
The
North Wales Coalfield
, of which Gresford was part, runs from
Point of Ayr
, on the
Flintshire
coast to the
Shropshire
border. Although coal mining records date back to the 15th century, it was not heavily exploited until the 18th century. By 1900, more than 12,500 miners produced three million tonnes a year.
[1]
Industrialist Henry Dennis of
Ruabon
, and his son Henry Dyke Dennis, began the colliery near Gresford in 1907.
[1]
The site was on the edge of the
Alyn Valley
, between the
Shrewsbury and Chester Railway
(later the
Great Western Railway
's
Birkenhead
to
London Paddington
line), and the old main road between Wrexham and
Chester
.
The Dennis' company United Westminster & Wrexham Collieries took four years to sink two deep
shafts
, the Dennis (downcast) and the Martin (upcast), located 50 yd (46 m) apart.
[2]
It was one of the deepest coal mines in the
Denbighshire
coalfield, the Dennis shaft reaching a depth of about 2,264 ft (690 m) and the Martin shaft about 2,252 ft (686 m).
[2]
Operations
[
edit
]
The first coal was produced in June, 1911 and full production reached before the outbreak of
World War I
. Three seams were worked: the Crank, the Brassey (named after engineer
Thomas Brassey
), and the Main. House coal was produced from the Crank seam, the Brassey seam was virtually gas free whilst the Main seam was very gaseous. Working conditions at the colliery were dusty, and very hot, the temperature often more than 90 °F (32 °C).
[2]
The Dennis section was divided into six districts: the 20s, 61's, 109's, 14's and 29's districts, along with a very deep district known as "95's and 24's".
[3]
These districts were worked by the
longwall
system but the 20's and 61's, which were furthest from the shaft, were worked by hand when the remaining districts were mechanised. The coal was renowned as being of very good quality and hot burning. In 1934, 2,200 men were employed at the colliery, with 1,850 working underground and 350 on the surface.
Strike, mechanisation and profitability
[
edit
]
The government passed the
Coal Mines Act 1911
requiring every new colliery to have
[1]
two intake airways into the mine, to allow air to circulate in the workings and only one air intake be allowed for the movement of coal. Gresford Colliery was in operation before the law came into force and was exempt. Retro digging a new shaft made little commercial sense, and not much profit had ever came out of the pit, so the Dennis didn't undertake the work.
[1]
After the
General Strike
, cost-cutting measures were introduced in all mines, including in safety provision. Five local collieries - Westminster, Wrexham & Acton, Vauxhall and Gatewen - shut in quick succession during the 1920s and 1930s.
[4]
Mechanisation, believed by the workers and unions to improve working conditions, created more dust and explosions, in an economic climate where the government were reluctant to enforce regulation.
[1]
By 1934, there were two main sections to Gresford Colliery, the Dennis and the South-east, which were both part mechanised. 2,200 miners worked in three eight-hour shifts. Some miners worked double shifts to earn extra money despite it being illegal. The Dennis family owned a residual 45% stake in the colliery, and wanting additional profitability put manager, William Bonsall, under pressure to increase the productivity of the whole colliery.
[1]
Accident
[
edit
]
Main article:
Gresford Disaster
One of Britain's worst coal mining disasters occurred at the colliery. The
Gresford Disaster
occurred on Saturday 22 September 1934, when 266 men died following an underground explosion.
[2]
As there was a
football
match on the Saturday afternoon between
Wrexham
and
Tranmere Rovers
, on Friday, 21 September, many miners doubled up their shifts so they could attend the match. This meant there were more miners down the pit than there ordinarily would have been.
[1]
The explosion occurred in the Dennis district at around 2am, the time when the men would be having their mid-shift snack.
[2]
Only six men survived the blast. A fire followed the explosion, and the mine was sealed off at the end of the following day. On 25 September, rescuer George Brown was killed on the surface when another explosion blew a seal off the Dennis shaft and he was hit by flying debris. Only eleven bodies were ever recovered.
[2]
The mine owners docked the men half a day's pay, as they had not completed a full day's shift.
Investigation
[
edit
]
Sir Henry Walker
, the Chief Inspector of Mines, chaired the inquiry which opened on 25 October 1934, at Church House, Regent Street, Wrexham. Walker was assisted by John Brass, for the mine owners; and Joseph Jones for the
Miners' Federation of Great Britain
(MFGB). Both sides employed barristers,
Hartley Shawcross
for the owners; while the MFGB were offered
pro bono publico
the services of Labour MP and barrister
Sir Stafford Cripps
.
[1]
Walker wanted access to the evidence, and although the pit was reopened in March, 1935, for safety reasons the Dennis section remained closed, and was eventually sealed. Having adjourned the inquiry in December, 1934, by December 1936, Walker legally had to make his final report.
[1]
The report noted that before the accident ventilation in some districts was possibly inadequate: in particular, it was noted that 14's and 29's districts were poorly ventilated. The report after the accident, considered that the main return airway for the 109's, 14's and 29's districts was far too small at 4 feet by 4 (according to one witness).
[5]
Evidence was given that 95's and 24's district, at 2,600 feet deep, was uncomfortably hot.
[3]
There were numerous breaches of regulations regarding the firing of explosive charges in 14's district, taking of dust samples, and other matters.
[6]
The colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the manager, William Bonsall, had been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability.
[7]
He had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the mine's other section, the South-Eastern or Slant.
[3]
Subsequent to the accident a number of theories were advanced in the Report as to the explosion's exact cause: Sir Stafford Cripps, the miners' legal representative, suggested that an explosion had been triggered in 95's by shotfiring (the firing of explosive charges) near a main airway. The miners' appointed Assessor also surmised that a large quantity of gas had accumulated at the top of the face in 14's district, which was then ignited by an accident with a
safety lamp
or by a spark from a coalcutter. The legal representatives of the pit's management, however, suggested that
firedamp
had accumulated in the main Dennis haulage road beyond the Clutch (a junction on the main drift where the underground haulage machinery was located) and which was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of gas.
[8]
This interpretation sought to deny that poor working practices were the ultimate cause of the disaster.
After the report was presented to parliament in January 1937, in April 1937, at Wrexham Petty Sessions, 42 charges were made against the colliery company, the manager and officials. Most were withdrawn or dismissed, but manager William Bonsall was convicted on eight counts of breaking mining safety law, and fined £140 with £350 costs.
[1]
Gresford Colliery Disaster Relief Fund
[
edit
]
The national and local newspapers focused on stories of heroism and bereavement, with speculation about who was at fault, or what caused the disaster left alone.
[1]
The disaster left 591 widows, children, parents and other dependants. In addition, over 1500 miners were temporarily without work, until the colliery was re-opened in January 1936. After each newspaper opened its own fund, they and national donations by September 1935 totalled £565,000.
[1]
The sum was divided equally split between the Lord Mayor of London's "Mansion House Fund" and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire's "Denbighshire Fund." The local committee which met in Wrexham took monies from both funds, and appointed a visitor to ensure that immediate relief was distributed in the form of grants and temporary weekly allowances. The two funds were amalgamated in July 1935, under the provision of a trust deed to form the Gresford Colliery Disaster Relief Fund, with three trustees: the Lord Mayor of London, the Governor of the Bank of England and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire. They devolved power to a local administration committee, who paid monies via an honorary actuary. The fund was wound up after the deaths of the last dependants, and donated residual monies to the creation of the memorial to the victims unveiled in 1982.
[9]
After the accident
[
edit
]
The mine remained sealed off for six months after the explosion. Districts of the mine were gradually reopened, although the Dennis district, where the explosion occurred remained sealed.
[2]
Coal production restarted in January 1936, and by 1945 there were 1,743 men employed.
[2]
Gresford was officially closed on 10 November 1973 due to a combination of exhaustion of existing coal reserves and geological problems.
In memoriam
[
edit
]
Wrexham Library has the memorial book on display with a list of the dead still buried underground. 
There is also a painting in
All Saints' Church, Gresford
, depicting scenes from the disaster and rescue.
Nine years after the closure of the pit, in 1982 the head gear wheel was preserved as part of the Gresford Disaster Memorial. It was dedicated on 26 November 1982, in the presence of the
Prince
and
Princess of Wales
, and the surviving relatives of those miners killed in the disaster. In 2000, as a final act of remembrance, the names of all those who lost their lives in the pit were added to the memorial.
[1]
On the 75th anniversary in 2009, various memorials took place, including
Wrexham Football Club
delaying their match by 15 minutes - as they would normally have done in the days when the mine was working.

who played an influential role during the
minority
of
William the Bastard
, prior to
his conquest
of
England
. Ralph was the
lord
of
Gacé
and other estates in
Normandy
.
Name
[
edit
]
Ralph was known to his contemporaries as "Ralph Asshead" or "the Ass-Headed" (
Ralph Tête d'Ane
) for the supposed resemblance of his large and shaggy head to an ill-kept
donkey
.
[1]
His name is also recorded as Raoul.
[

]
Life
[
edit
]
Ralph was the middle son of
Robert, Archbishop of Rouen
and his wife Herlevea,
[2]
making him part of the
ducal house
of
Normandy
in
11th-century
France
.
[3]
He was the cousin of
Robert I
,
duke of Normandy
, and the first cousin once removed of Robert's son
William the Bastard
.
[4]
Ralph's older brother Richard received the
countship
of
Évreux
, Ralph was given the
lordship
of
Gacé
in
Lower Normandy
.
[5]
He also held
Bavent
, Noyon-sur-Andelle (now
Charleval
), Gravençon (near present-day
Lillebonne
), and
Écouché
.
[6]
Upon the death of
Duke Robert
in 1035 while returning from a
pilgrimage
to
Jerusalem
, Ralph's father Robert acted as the regent for the duke's young
illegitimate
son William.
[7]
The archbishop was able to maintain order in Normandy until his own death in 1037, whereupon rebellions and private wars erupted.
[8]
Ralph was one of the rebellious lords.
[9]
In 1040, assassins acting upon his orders murdered
Gilbert
,
count
of
Brionne
and the chief tutor of young duke William, while he was riding near Eschafour.
[9]
In 1043, William and his advisors
William of Talou
and
Archbishop Mauger
enlisted Ralph's support and gave him command of the duchy's own forces.
[10]
Ralph then campaigned against Thurstan le Goz who, along with the
French king
Henry I
, had occupied
Falaise
.
[10]
Ralph captured Falaise, forced Thurstan into exile, and drove Henry's forces from Normandy.
[10]
While Ralph remained a key member of Duke William's inner circle,
[11]
he made large donations to
Jumièges Abbey
.
[12]
Ralph died in 1051.
[3]
Family
[
edit
]
Ralph married Basilla, daughter of
Gerard Flaitel
. They had a son, Robert de Gacé, who died without heirs.
[13]
After Ralph's death, Basilla remarried, wedding Hugh de Gournay.
[12]
Legacy
[
edit
]
Ralph Asshead's former lands were among those demanded by his nephew
William
,
count
of
Évreux
, in exchange for consenting to the marriage of his virgin niece and
ward
Bertrade
to the repeatedly divorced
Fulk the Rude
of
Anjou
.
[1]
This being necessary to
Robert Curthose
's suppression of a revolt by the
Manceaux
, Robert yielded and restored almost all of the lands to the family.
[1]
Bertrade subsequently left Fulk or was abducted and became the
queen consort
of
Philip I
.

Chesapeake Bayhawks
season
was the last season for the Bayhawks franchise of
Major League Lacrosse
, and tenth season using the 'Chesapeake' Bayhawks moniker. It is Dave Cottle's second season of his second tenure as head coach of the team. In 2018, Cottle led the Bayhawks to their first playoff appearance in five years.
The Bayhawks wanted to look to get back to the postseason again, after posting a 9-5 record in 2018, a season that ended in disappointment after a 13-12 home semifinal loss to the eventual champion
Denver Outlaws
.
[1]
Transactions

Steele Stanwick
to a one-year contract extension.
[3]
March 24 - 12 players are added to the preseason roster following the league's dispersal draft.
[4]
The most notable addition was Nick Mariano. Nick formerly played under his brother Tom, who was the head coach for the
Florida Launch
before league contraction. Tom, who led the Launch to the franchise's only postseason appearance in 2017, was announced as an assistant coach for the Bayhawks just a day before.
[5]
In-season
[

It operates a treatment plant and a mining camp, which are located in the districts of
San Francisco de Asis de Yurusyacan
and
Yanacancha
,
province of Pasco
. The company's activities include the production and sale of
lead
,
zinc
and
copper
concentrates. In addition, the company is active in the electric power generation, and it owns two hydroelectric power plants: Marcopampa and Chaprin with an installed capacity of 6.6
megawatts
.
Atacocha was bought in 2008 by the Brazilian conglomerate
Votorantim Group
, which owns 70% of its interests. Until then, the enterprise was publicly listed in the
Lima Stock Exchange
and was part of the
S&P/BVL Peru General Index
, the country's main index.
As of 2000, Atacocha had extracted 29 million
tonnes
of
ore
in more than 275 km of horizontal and vertical sites. With this, the company had produced 2.3 million megatons of
zinc concentrates
, 1.7 million of
lead
, and more than 100 million fine ounces of
silver
.
History
[
edit
]
The company was founded in 1936
[4]
and is headquartered in
Lima
. It was established by Francisco José (Paco) Gallo y Díez de Escalada,
[5]
a Spanish
hidalgo
whose family had held jurisdictional lordship over the
Valley of Sedano
in
Burgos
, northern Spain. Descendant of a once-powerful family, they had held prominent religious and colonial posts, such as Juan López Gallo (1500-1571), Baron of
Male
and governor of
Spanish Netherlands
.
[6]
Gallo was born 1 February 1905 in
Santander
. As the youngest of 8 and educated in
Bilbao
and
London
, he was sent to Peru in 1923 by his father to
liquidate
a family company and return home following the failed attempts of the rest of his siblings. The company, "Casa Gallo" was an important yet declining commercial conglomerate that owned land and mines in the country. At his arrival, the astute 18-year-old saw business opportunity and successfully sold Casa Gallo in an effort to buy land in
Cerro de Pasco
, situated at more than 14,000 ft of altitude. On his return to Europe, he became a
mining engineer
and bought rights of mine exploitation, founding Compañía Minera Atacocha 6 February 1936 in Lima.
[7]
The original company logo included a
rooster
as a direct reference to the founder's family name and
coat of arms
(Gallo is Spanish for rooster).
Luis Gallo
, a distant cousin of Paco who was prime minister of Peru, was a board member at Atacocha.
On 20 March 1936, the first Session of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting was held. During the meeting, the Board of Directors that would be presided over by Mr. Gino Bianchini was appointed, and would be made up of Gerardo Diez, Alberto Quesada, Manuel B. Llosa and Oscar Díaz Dulanto, with the interim Management falling to the latter. On 20 April,
Italian
engineer Edgardo Portaro Mazzetti was appointed Manager of the company. Gallo occupied the
chairmanship
of the company until 1973 when he renounced and moved to
Madrid
following the radical reforms of the military government of
Juan Velasco Alvarado
.
[8]
This was despite the original petition of his father to sell the declining family enterprise and return home.

Released: 19 October 2007
What's It All About?
is the second and final album by British singer-songwriter Chris Hardman, better known as
Lil' Chris
. The album was released on October 6, 2008,
[1]
following the release of the album's lead and only single "
We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off
" more than a year earlier on October 19, 2007.
The album was in fact an incompleted studio album; only six songs were recorded for the project, before
RCA Records
pulled the plug on any further studio recordings following the poor performance of the album's lead single. However, for contractual reasons, RCA were required to honour Chris' two-album deal, and therefore decided to package the six recorded songs with seven songs previously released on his debut album,
Lil' Chris
.
The album was then subsequently launched alongside Hardman's
Everybody Loves Lil' Chris
TV series for
Channel 4
in an attempt to boost sales, but only managed to peak at #94 on the
UK Albums Chart
. The album remains Hardman's last release before his death in 2015.

An
automatic trip
is an action performed by some system, usually a
safety instrumented system
,
programmable logic controller
, or
distributed control system
, to put an industrial process into a safe state.  It is triggered by some parameter going into a pre-determined unsafe state.  It is usually preceded by an
alarm
to give a process operator a chance to correct the condition to prevent the trip, since trips are usually costly because of lost production.

[3]
Biography
[
edit
]
Clara Melendres
was born in 1934 in
Doña Ana, New Mexico
. She is a 14th-generation New Mexican and member of a prominent
Hispanic
family who lived in the state prior to the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
, which ceded the area to the United States.
[2]
[3]
[4]
Apodaca was raised in
Las Cruces, New Mexico
, and an unincorporated area of Doña Ana outside of the city, and graduated from Union High School (now known as
Las Cruces High School
) as class
homecoming queen
.
[3]
She enrolled at
New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts
(present-day
New Mexico State University
) to pursue secondary education, but dropped out in June 1955 at the end of her Junior year to get a job.
[3]
In 1956, Apodaca was hired as a
stenographer
for the
United States Army Signal Corps
's supply department on the
White Sands Proving Ground
, now called the
White Sands Missile Range
.
[3]
In March 1956, Apodaca was crowned "Miss Nike 1956" in the White Sands 
Proving Ground's
beauty pageant
.
[3]
One month later, she competed as White Sands' beauty contestant at the
Truth or Consequences Fiesta
. She was a pageant finalist at the event hosted by actor
Tab Hunter
, but came in second place to Beverly Sikes of
Texas
.
[3]
An old high school boyfriend,
Jerry Apodaca
, heard she was competing at the Truth or Consequences Fiesta. They reconnected and married on August 18, 1956, at a wedding held at Saint Genevieve's Catholic Church in Las Cruces.
[3]
The couple moved to Albuquerque, so Jerry Apodaca could finish college, and had five children over the next seven years.
[3]
The family returned to Las Cruces in 1961, where Clara Apodaca raised the children and worked in the family
insurance
business, but she was unable to finish her bachelor's degree at
New Mexico State University
.
[3]
First Lady of New Mexico
[
edit
]
Apodaca entered politics while campaigning on behalf of her husband, who was elected to the first of four consecutive terms in the
New Mexico House of Representatives
in 1966. Jerry Apodaca was elected
governor
in the
1974 New Mexico gubernatorial election
, becoming the state's first Hispanic governor since
Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo
in 1921.
Clara Apodaca served as New Mexico's first lady from 1975 to 1979. The new first lady sought to promote the arts and soon came across a potential project within the
New Mexico State Capitol
. In early 1975, Apodaca noticed an underused "governor’s reception area" on the fourth floor of the Capitol building, which was mostly used as a seating area by journalists and other members of the media.
[3]
Apodaca conceived the idea of a new, potential art gallery in fourth floor space.
[3]
Though it was called the "governor’s reception area", the room actually belonged to the
New Mexico Legislature
, which had to grant the first lady permission to convert it into a gallery.
[4]
Apodaca quickly received permission from the Legislature and worked to renovate it in just a few months.
[3]
[4]
First Lady Apodaca's
Governor's Gallery
on the fourth floor formally opened in April 1975, just a few months after she had conceptualized the idea.
[2]
The Governor's Gallery's inaugural opening exhibition featured the works of
Georgia O'Keeffe
, one of the country's most famous painters at the time.
[1]
[4]
O'Keeffe, who was in her 80s at the time. agreed to participate in the exhibition due to her admiration for New Mexico and a personal phone call from Governor Jerry Apodaca at the first lady's behest.
[4]
Georgia O'Keeffe oversaw the installation of her works, which was opened the public for six weeks.
[4]
The artist attended the gallery's opening in-person, to the surprise of some observers, and worked the reception line for two hours.
[3]
[4]
Apodaca supervised more than 40 art shows and exhibitions at the Governor's Gallery during her four years as first lady, including a solo exhibition of works by
Chiricahua
sculptor Allan Houser later in 1975.
[3]
The Governor's Gallery remains open and active to the present day. Apodaca estimates that millions of visitors have visited the gallery since its opening in 1975.
[4]
A plaque commemorating Clara Apodaca as the gallery's founder has been installed.
[2]
[3]
Elsewhere in the Capitol building, Clare Apodaca started a series a "brown bag" concerts and recitals in the
rotunda
for employees, elected officials, and visitors, featuring a variety of musical genres and dances, including
ballet
,
bluegrass
,
flamenco
,
jazz
,
opera
, and musical theater productions.
[2]
[3]
As first lady, Apodaca also served on the women's board for the Museum of New Mexico and the Santa Fe Festival of the Arts' advisory council.
[2]
She also established the ""First Lady's Day for the Physically Challenged" at the
New Mexico State Fair
beginning in 1977.
[2]

[3]
[5]
As secretary, Apodaca oversaw the New Mexico state-owned museums system and the
state park system
.
[4]
She created the state museums' new admission system, which charged visitors an entrance fee.
[4]
The new admission fees were opposed by her boss, Governor Anaya, but had been mandated by the New Mexico Legislature to pay for the upkeep of the museums.
[4]
Clara Apodaca also oversaw the opening of the
New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science
in Albuquerque in 1986.
[2]

Harold Craxton
.

[13]
The album received generally positive reviews, and received a score of 72/100 from
Metacritic
, based on six reviews.
[15]
Gregory Heaney of
AllMusic
gave the album three out of five stars, saying "At this stage, Body Count haven't changed much, and really aren't likely to, which means that if you were on board with their earlier work, then
Manslaughter
has even more rap-influenced metal to fuel your rage. However, if you weren't sold on these guys in the first place, this album isn't likely to change your mind."
[10]
While Craig Hogan of All About The Rock said "This is quite possibly the best album BC have ever released."
[11]
Phil Freeman of
Alternative Press
gave the album four out of five stars, saying "
Manslaughter
is a ferocious, heavy record that proves once again that Ice-T and company are undeniable metal contenders, far more than a pop-cultural footnote."
[12]
Jon Hadusek of
Consequence of Sound
gave the album a B−, saying "Lyrically and musically,
Manslaughter
is easily Body Count's most inspired work since their self-titled debut, because it sounds like a reconciliation of all the misconceptions the band had to deal with in the past. It's a statement of intent this time: They want to be heard, no matter who gets offended or pissed off. If you can't take it, don't listen. If you can, then stop talking shit and enjoy the ride."

History
[

Origins
[
edit
]
Beginning in January 1942, U.S. Navy stations in Hawaii (
Station HYPO
), Cavite/Corregidor (
Station CAST
) and OP-20-G (
Station NEGAT
, at Washington) began issuing formal intelligence decrypts far in advance of the U.S. Army or Central Bureau.
General MacArthur had his own signals intelligence unit, Station 6, while he was in command in the
Philippines
before the start of the war, and was not fully dependent on the U.S. Navy for that type of information. However, most of the signals intelligence he received was from the U.S. Navy's
Station CAST
, originally at Cavite in the
Manila Navy Yard
, and evacuated to
Corregidor Island
after Japanese successes. Prior to the war, it had to be sent by courier, which caused some delay and annoyance.
General MacArthur escaped from Corregidor in the Philippines in a PT boat to Mindanao and flew to Australia from Del Monte on a
Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress
. He made his way to Melbourne, arriving there on 22 March
1942
.
The Signals Intelligence units operating in Australia at the time of MacArthur's arrival in Melbourne were as follows:
No. 4 Australian Special Wireless Section at Park Orchards near Ringwood in Melbourne
A small Diplomatic and Press intercept section at Park Orchards
A Diplomatic cryptographic and intelligence section at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne
Some British Army Signals personnel from the
Far East Combined Bureau
who had escaped from Java
A small
RAAF
Intercept section in Darwin
A small RAN intercept and Direction Finding (D/F) organisation
A small RAN cryptographic and intelligence section at the Navy Office in Melbourne
and, eventually, after evacuation from Corredigor by submarine,
the personnel of Station CAST, the US Navy SIGNIT group in the Far East. They were responsible for channeling all SIGINT information to
OP-20-G
in Washington. It became known as
FRUMEL
and obtained IBM equipment in 1942 to replace that which had been left behind in Manila Bay on leaving Corregidor and employed it throughout their tenure in Melbourne.
Establishment of Central Bureau
[
edit
]
One of Macarthur's first decisions when he arrived in Melbourne was to expand the SIGINT operations already existing in Australia.
General Colin Simpson (right) with Major General
Spencer B. Akin
(left), the Chief Signal Officer at GHQ
Brigadier General
Spencer B. Akin
, MacArthur's Chief Signals Officer held discussions with Major General
Colin Simpson
. They agreed that a Research and Control Centre to handle Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) was needed. MacArthur subsequently issued orders for the formation of two complementary groups:
An intercept organisation known initially as No. 5 Wireless Section
A research and control centre known as the Central Bureau.
Initially Central Bureau was made up of 50% American, 25% Australian Army and 25% RAAF personnel.
Directors of the Central Bureau in Brisbane in 1944. Sinkov is second from the left.
Central Bureau was a joint US-Australian signal intelligence organisation, established on 15 April 1942 under the command of US Army Major General
Spencer B. Akin
, with headquarters in
Melbourne
.Its role was to research and decrypt army and air intercept traffic and work in close co-operation with other SIGINT centres in the USA, United Kingdom and India.
A small Naval cryptographic group also became part of the secret new unit. It was led by Commander
Eric Nave
, who with Professor
Dale Trendall
had been working on Japanese diplomatic and naval codes at
Victoria Barracks
.
Central Bureau was established in a gabled, ivy-clad mansion called "Cranleigh" in Domain Road, at
South Yarra
, Melbourne.
Major General Akin's Executive Officer, Major (later Colonel) Joe R. Sherr had been evacuated from the Philippines (Station 6). He was responsible for arranging for the first group of US "SIGINT" personnel to come to Australia, and as Akin's control was indirect he was responsible for day-to-day running of the bureau. He was killed when returning from a liaison visit to the
wireless Experimental Centre
in India, when his aircraft crashed 3 km from Calcutta airfield on 21 September 1943.
[2]
Sandford had wanted to send "Pappy" Clark
[nb 1]
to the conference but Akin said that MacArthur would not agree to send Clark (only a major) and so sent Colonel Sherr instead.
[3]
He was succeeded by Major
Abraham "Abe" Sinkov
, a mathematician, who was appointed assistant director of Central Bureau. Sinkov had previously been a senior cryptographer in the US Army Signals Intelligence Service under
William F. Friedman
. Sinkov had previously been in charge of an intercept station in Panama. He had visited Britain in 1941 to facilitate the exchange of cryptographic information.
With Sinkov (US Army), the three assistant directors were Australians Alistair "Mic" Sandford (Major then Lt-Col, Second AIF) and Roy Booth (Squadron Leader then Wing Commander, RAAF). They acted as head of their respective service organisations; with Sandford the bureau executive officer under Sherr, then Booth from 1944. The bureau functioned well and harmoniously, with job demarcation as Australian experience was from wireless interception and traffic analysis in the Middle East and the Americans in breaking codes and cyphers, although this "broke down" as the war went on. Signals organisations tend to be "meritocratic" rather than on rank.
[4]
Experienced intercept
Kana
operators from a
Royal Australian Air Force
unit at
Townsville
were assigned to the new Central Bureau. The RAAF at the time had a number of Kana operators being trained and were about to train a further 13
WAAAF
personnel. (
Katakana
is one of the syllabic forms of written Japanese).
The cryptanalysts who had operated from the
Malinta Tunnel
during the
Battle of Corregidor
got out to Australia by submarine in two groups. Their equipment was pushed into
Manila Bay
. They were used to assist the Australian Wireless Group units. A group of cryptographic, cryptanalytic and translator personnel from the Japanese section of the Washington Signal Intelligence Service were also moved to Australia. More Australians were also recruited to Central Bureau after it was established.
Central Bureau-FRUMEL relations
[
edit
]
MacArthur was not happy to depend on the Navy's discretion in handling his SIGINT requirements. He felt he had experienced problems with such an arrangement when he was in
Manila
. MacArthur's Intelligence Officer (G-2) was Major General
Charles A. Willoughby
.
In Australia the rules laid down by Cmdr Rudy Fabian the head of FRUMEL (through Admiral
Leary
) for receiving
FRUMEL
briefings said that Fabian or his representative were to brief MacArthur and his chief of staff
Richard K. Sutherland
at 1400 each day, but could not copy or distribute the material. The representative was not to be kept waiting. Only MacArthur and Sutherland were to be present; Willoughby, his G2 was excluded. Once Fabian burnt a document in front of Willoughby on his way out and dropped the ashes in his bin to demonstrate that he was not allowed to see it!
[5]
[6]
Commander
Nave
moved to Central Bureau in mid-1942 from the combined Australian Navy/U.S. Navy operation in Melbourne known as
FRUMEL
, which came under U.S. Navy control (Lt Rudy Fabian) in mid-1942. Fabian thought Nave had breached security, and got rid of Nave and the civilians (including Professor
Thomas Room
, who also went to Central Bureau); the
Holden Agreement
specifically stated that
Eric Nave
was not to work at
FRUMEL
, indicating that Fabian had "friends in high places".
[7]
Although Nave headed up the "Solutions" division there, most records indicate he personally dealt with minor Japanese naval codes and simple substitution ciphers in spite of his Japanese language capability and long history with Japanese codes. However Duffy wrote that
Nave was actively working on
JN-25
until the day he was expelled from Monterrey
.
[8]
Colonel Sinkov and his American staff worked on the high-level Japanese Army codes.
Central Bureau was an unusual cryptographic organisation, coming under the direct command of an area commander (MacArthur) rather than reporting to a central cryptographic organisation; as confirmed by
Marshall
's reply. This decision led to periodic ructions in the American military establishment about MacArthur's command having its own cryptographic service under his command; a privilege that he jealously guarded.
[9]
No.1. Wireless Unit
[
edit
]
On 25 April 1942 the small RAAF Intercept Station operating in two
back-to-back houses
at 21 Sycamore Street and 24 French Street in the suburb of
Pimlico
in Townsville was given its new name of
No. 1 Wireless Unit
and became part of Central Bureau. The newly named Unit included 7 RAAF, 1 AMF and 4 United States Army personnel in No. 1 Wireless Unit at Townsville. This RAAF Unit had started earlier in March 1942 as a small intercept station located in the initial two houses at Pimlico under Wing Commander Booth. By 6 July 1942 the intercept operator numbers at Central Bureau had increased from six to twenty nine.
Coral Sea and Kokoda
[
edit
]
A message on 9 April 1942 indicated that the "RZP Campaign" against
Port Moresby
was to be an invasion not an air raid and which would isolate Australia from America. Fabian at
FRUMEL
briefed MacArthur who was "incredulous" as he expected the target would be New Caledonia, so Fabian explained the (
JN-25
) code-breaking process and showed him the Japanese commander’s intercepted message with the objectives to restrict enemy fleet movements and attack the north coast of Australia. So a transport due to leave the next day for New Caledonia was sent to Port Moresby. On 23 April Fabian showed MacArthur that the IJN was amassing a large force at Truk, and planned to occupy Tulagi also. MacArthur got an Australian reconnaissance plane to "discover" the Port Moresby invasion force on 5 May, leading to the
Battle of the Coral Sea
.
[10]
On 19 and 23 May messages indicated that the Japanese were proposing to land at Buna and go overland over the Owen Stanley Range via the
Kokoda Track
to Port Moresby; though MacArthur, Willoughby and Blamey were unconvinced saying "Nobody in their right senses would land there".
Blamey
took "minimal precautions" to defend the track, resulting in heavy losses for the 39th Battalion sent there.
[11]
Move from Melbourne to Brisbane
[
edit
]
On 20 July 1942, General MacArthur moved his headquarters to
Brisbane
. A separate American intelligence operation was located nearby in a building called "Palma Rosa" at 9 Queens Road,
Hamilton
. "Palma Rosa" was commandeered by the Counter Intelligence Corps, G-2 Section, Headquarters U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (U.S.A.F.F.E.).
[12]
Central Bureau also relocated to Brisbane in September, with the American contingent of six officers and eighteen enlisted men moving first. The bureau moved to the suburb of
Ascot
, not far from the new American airfield at
Eagle Farm Airport
. Staff were accommodated as boarders in private homes or in military camps with daily transport by truck or bus. Officers obtained rented accommodation around Ascot and nearby suburbs. Mic Sandford the head of the Australian Army contingent rented a house at 50 Elderney Terrace in nearby
Hamilton
; this became a social centre and the scene of frequent dinner and drinking parties.
[13]
21 Henry St, Ascot, Brisbane
The CB headquarters was in "Nyrambla", a huge house at 21 Henry Street built as a grand mansion in 1886, although the large 6 ha section was subdivided from 1905 and the house was converted into flats in the late 1920s. The house still retained rooms with marble fireplaces, ornate plaster and 4.8m high ceilings, and the building remained the main administrative and training centre for the bureau.
[14]
When the bureau assumed an augmented role to coordinate land and air forces signals intelligence, additional facilities were located a few minutes walk away at a small public park opposite the
Ascot railway station
Hence it became known as "Ascot Park" although officially called "Oriel Park". Between the station, Kitchener Road and Lancaster Road, the park had nearly 20 temporary army wooden huts by mid-1943 and 31 by September 1945. Across the road at 77 Kitchener Road a disused brick Fire Station was used for banks of
IBM
punched card
equipment used by cryptanalysts to analyze intercepted cyphertext. The machines had been in the garage at the rear of 21 Henry Street but the noise from all-hours operation bought complaints from neighbours. When the IBM machines were removed from 21 Henry Street the garage was occupied by No. 11 Australian Cypher Section and filled with
Typex
machines which were operated mostly by
Australian Women's Army Service
(AWAS) personnel.
[15]
Australian Special Intelligence Personnel Sections (ASIPS)
[
edit
]
In 1942, Sandford raised two intelligence sections to operate at the wireless sites in the field. These personnel, known as ASIPS, would be a liaison between Central Bureau and the Kana operators, greatly increasing the speed in which messages could be decrypted and translated. The first unit was stationed at Coomalie Creek, NT, under the command of Captain William E Clarke. This ASIP unit, in direct coordination with local air force commanders, decrypted mainly tactical codes which allowed Allied forces to combat the air raids against the north of Australia. In 1943 these ASIP units were sent to New Guinea.

Further information:
Japanese-American service in World War II
Starting in October 1942, Japanese POWs were interrogated by a joint US-Australian unit called
ATIS
at two houses called "
Tighnabruaich
" and "
Witton House
" at
Indooroopilly
in Brisbane. ATIS was staffed by Japanese-Americans (Nisei) and Australians who spoke Japanese. After interrogation, the Japanese POWs were often sent to the larger
POW camp at Cowra
, NSW. Translators at Indooroopilly were also involved in the translation of the captured codebooks from Sio.
[17]

Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, Brisbane
Shootdown of Yamamoto
[
edit
]
In April 1943, the US Navy in Melbourne and Hawaii intercepted a Japanese naval message encoded in
JN-25
, the main and most secure Japanese naval code. The US Navy had not cracked JN-25, so they were only able to recover small portions of the message. The Japanese garrison commander on
Ballale
did not have JN-25 so the message was retransmitted to him by Japanese signals in Rabaul in a less secure army air to ground code. This message was intercepted by Australian wireless units in Port Moresby and translated by the ASIPs unit in Townsville. This message was forwarded to FRUMEL and Hawaii which allowed the US Navy codebreakers to inform Nimitz that the message was broken.
[18]
The message contained Admiral
Isoroku Yamamoto
's itinerary for an upcoming trip to
Rabaul
. Admiral Yamamoto was the Commander in Chief of the Combined Japanese Fleet, the architect of the attack on
Pearl Harbor
.
However, the message said that the trip might be postponed due to weather, so confirmation was needed. This came when another Army Air/Ground signal was intercepted by 51 Wireless Section in
Coomalie Creek
near
Darwin
. This intercept was sent to Central Bureau at 21 Henry Street, Ascot, in Brisbane where it was decrypted and forwarded to FRUMEL where it was reportedly translated by a U.S. Navy linguist.
[19]
Although Central Bureau may have decrypted the message, the interception of his flight was based on decrypts of Japanese naval messages by FRUPAC/Station HYPO in Hawaii, FRUMEL, OP-20-G in Washington and Station AL on Guadalcanal.
Major Lasswell
USMC in Hawaii decrypted the Japanese Naval message first and
Captain Layton
(Pacific Fleet Intelligence in Hawaii) gave it to Admiral Nimitz who authorized a shootdown attempt after determining from ComNavAirSoPac that it could be done with by one of his Army Air Corp units on Guadalcanal.
Operation Vengeance
was carried out on April 18 and resulted in the shooting down of Yamamoto's "Betty" bomber by P-38s from Henderson Field, Guadalcanal.
The Sio Box
[
edit
]
Central Bureau did not break any high level Japanese Army codes until mid-1943 success with the
Water Transport Code
. In January 1944, one main line Japanese Army code was broken with help from a buried trunk found at
Sio
,
New Guinea
, left by retreating Japanese Army troops of the 20th Division. The Bureau spent a day drying the damp pages, and the flood of decoded messages (2000 per day) that ensued meant that the Bureau had to ask the US Navy for assistance with translations. FRUMEL sent translators from Melbourne who had experience with the additional vocabulary and jargon associated with the larger JN-25 code. The Japanese thought that the code books had been destroyed and therefore did not issue a code change.
[20]
[21]
Central Bureau's decryption of the mainline Army code, combined with traffic analysis helped the Allies avoid Japanese strongpoints during the
Admiralty Islands campaign
, the Allied capture of a group of islands to the north-west of Rabaul.
[22]
In early April 1944, the Japanese changed their mainline code, suspecting correctly that the old codebooks had been compromised. This meant all mainline Japanese army traffic became unreadable to the Allies overnight.
[23]
In April and May, Central Bureau, together with analysts from FRUMEL and FRUPAC, was involved in the detection of the
Take Ichi convoy
, which was intending to reinforce Japanese positions in New Guinea and the Philippines. US submarines attacked the convoy, sinking a number of transports and killing over 4000 soldiers
[24]
In May 1944, following the Allied invasion of Hollandia in
Operation Reckless
, Central Bureau moved to Hollandia. In October they moved to Leyte and at the end of the war they were based in San Miguel on Luzon. After the war, they were transferred to Tokyo.
[25]
End of the war
[
edit
]
On August 14, Emperor Hirohito sent a message through Swiss diplomats that Japan would capitulate under the terms of the
Potsdam Declaration
. On the morning of August 15, MacArthur was notified of the emperor's offer of surrender. However, at this point it was still just an offer. MacArthur and General Akin summoned the Central Bureau Australian army officer Major Stan "Pappy" Clark to Manila to make contact with the Japanese. After trying to contact
Radio Tokyo
and various Japanese army frequencies Clark was finally able to make contact with a Japanese diplomatic station in
Singapore
. Following this, a secret Japanese delegation was organised to travel to Manila to meet MacArthur.
[26]
Akin offered Clark a commission in the US Army to come to Japan, but Clark refused, saying "I've had enough. I want to go home".
[27]
Central Bureau continued to intercept Japanese communications in the days following the end of the war, providing information on how Japanese forces were reacting to the surrender. Other intercepts regarded information on the condition and treatment of Allied prisoners-of-war. Dufty claims that although these intercepts were "clear evidence" that prisoners had been mistreated, they could never be used in a war crimes trial without jeopardising Ultra's secrets.

Candia Farm Vehicle
Candia
is a
Greek
company producing Agricultural machinery and equipment, based in
Herakleion
,
Crete
. It is representative of many companies in this country (and especially on that island), that produced multi-purpose light farm vehicles.
A particular family of vehicles that seems to be a characteristic Greek development starting in the mid-1960s, was a light farm tractor-truck combination usually on three-wheel chassis, with or without cab. Some were constructed by smaller companies, or even small workshops, but a number of more significant companies evolved, especially in
Crete
(where they are called
"skaftikies"
), including (except for
Candia
)
Record
,
Kronos
,
Knossos
,
Minos
,
,
Talos
,
Jupiter
etc.; other companies included
Demetra
in
Volos
,
Diana
,
Standard
,
Zeus Hellas
in
Athens
, and many others. Engines used included
Sachs
,
Ilo
, local models by
Mekmotors
(
Ruggerini
licence),
Petropoulos
,
Malkotsis
etc.  By the early 1980s this kind of vehicle was so widespread, that had become characteristic of the Greek countryside.
Candia
was one of the few that became true industrial producers, turning out thousands of vehicles sold throughout the country, in addition to "classic" walking tractors. It built many models, usually with
Sachs
or
Ilo
engines, the most popular of which was a rugged three-wheel chassis combining truck and tractor functions.
This type of vehicle was considered obsolete by new buyers, already by the early 1990s, and most companies either closed down or (as in the case of
Candia
) diverted to other farm equipment.

Myzus persicae
) being one of the most prevalent and indiscriminate carriers.

Evolution
[
edit
]
Aphids originated in the late
Cretaceous
about
million years ago
(Mya), but the Aphidinae which comprises about half of the 4700 described species and genera of aphids alive today come from their most recent radiation which occurred in the late Tertiary less than 10 Mya.
[1]
[2]
Reproduction
[
edit
]
Most aphid species can reproduce both asexually and sexually, with several
parthenogenetic generations between each period of sexual reproduction. This is
known as cyclical parthenogenesis and, in temperate regions, sexual reproduction
occurs in autumn and results in the production of overwintering eggs, which hatch
the following spring and initiate another cycle. Many pest aphids, however, do not
overwinter as an egg but as nymphs or adults and others as both eggs and active
stages (see Williams and Dixon 2007). For their size, the parthenogenetic individuals have very short developmental times and potentially prodigious rates of increase
(de Réaumur 1737;
[3]
[
]
Huxley 1858; Kindlmann and Dixon 1989; Dixon 1992). Thus,
aphids show very complex and rapidly changing within-year dynamics, with each
clone going through several generations during the vegetative season and being
made up of many individuals, which can be widely scattered in space. The survival
of the eggs and/or overwintering aphids determines the numbers of aphids present
the following spring.
[4]
The within-year dynamics of aphids are largely determined by seasonal changes
in host quality. Aphids do best when amino acids are actively translocated in the
phloem. In spring, the leaves grow and import amino acids via the phloem; in summer leaves are mature and export mainly sugars. In autumn, the leaves senesce and
export amino acids and other nutrients. Thus on trees the leaves are most suitable
for aphids in spring and autumn. The differences in within-year population dynamics of aphids are due to differences in the effect these seasonal fluctuations in host
plant quality have on the per capita rate of increase and intraspecific competition
in each species. This annual cycle, consisting of two short periods when the host
plant is very favourable and a long intervening period when it is less favourable, is
well documented for tree dwelling aphids. This has greatly facilitated the modelling
of their population dynamics. In general the aphid carrying capacity of annual crop
plants tends to increase with the season until the plants mature after which it tends
to decrease very rapidly. Thus, the aphid carrying capacity of trees tends to be high
in spring and autumn and low in summer, whereas that particularly of short-season
annual crops tends to be low early in a year, peaking mid year and then declining.
Characteristics
[
edit
]
Members of the Aphididae are soft-bodied, pear-shaped insects called aphids, as are other members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Most of them have a pair of little tubes, called
cornicles
, projecting
dorsally
from the
posterior
of their
abdomens
. The cornicles have been variously interpreted as organs of excretion or for the production of honeydew, but their only confirmed function to date is that they produce fatty
alarm pheromones
when the insects are attacked by predators.
[5]
Hyadaphis
winged and wingless adults
When wings are present they occur only on particular
morphs
called "
alates
", and wingless morphs are said to be "
apterous
". The forewing (
mesothoracic
wing) of the alate in the Aphididae has four to six veins attached to a major vein-like structure that has been interpreted as the combined stems of all the other
major wing veins
. That structure ends in a stigma, a solid spot on the
anterior
margin of the forewing. The rear (metathoracic) wings have a similar scheme, but simpler in structure, with no stigma
[5]
The rear wing however, does bear a
hamulus
, a small hook that, when in flight, engages the
claval
fold of the forewing, keeping the wing beats in
synchrony
.
All aphids have very small eyes, sucking mouthparts in the form of a relatively long, segmented
rostrum
, and fairly long
antennae
.
These insects are so small (a few millimeters in length), that winds can transport them for fairly long distances. They are often green, but might be red or brown, as well. They move quite slowly and cannot jump or hop. Aphids excrete a sugary liquid called
honeydew
, because the plant sap from which they feed contains excess carbohydrates relative to its low protein content. To satisfy their protein needs, they absorb large amounts of sap and excrete the excess carbohydrates. Honeydew is used as food by
ants
,
honeybees
, and many other insects.
Classification
[
edit
]
There is considerable controversy in the classification of aphids, with conservative classifications recognizing as many as 24 subfamilies within a single family Aphididae and others elevating various subfamilies to establish as many as 9 other families within Aphidoidea in addition to Aphididae.

View of the Ventura County Line railway on Tampa Avenue heading to
Chatsworth station
The
Metrolink
Ventura County Line
is a
commuter rail
line serving
Ventura County
and the
San Fernando Valley
in
Los Angeles County
and the
City of Los Angeles
, in the
Southern California
system.
[2]
The line is the successor of the short lived
CalTrain
commuter rail line.
Schedules
[
edit
]
As of October 23, 2023
, the Ventura County Line is served by 20 Metrolink trains (ten in each direction) each weekday, running primarily at peak hours in the peak direction of travel.
[3]
However, of those trains, only six trains (three in each direction) travel the entire length of the line between Los Angeles and
Ventura-East station
. Sixteen trains (eight in each direction)
short turn
, traveling only between Los Angeles and
Moorpark station
, while 20 trains (ten in each direction) travel between Los Angeles and
Chatsworth station
.
[3]
Two round trips operate on weekends over the entire length of the line. Metrolink passengers (except those at Ventura-East station) also have access to four
Pacific Surfliner
trains (two in each direction) each day through a
codeshare agreement
.
[3]
Tracks
[
edit
]
The line operates between Moorpark and Los Angeles Union Station on tracks owned by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority - the Ventura Subdivision from Moorpark to Burbank Airport and the Valley Subdivision, the Valley Subdivision from Burbank to Glendale, becoming the River Subdivision into Los Angeles Union Station. It uses the
Coast Line
of the
Union Pacific Railroad
between Moorpark and
Oxnard
and into Ventura where the Santa Paula Branch splits from the rest of the Coast Line. The
East Ventura station
and layover facility are on the
Santa Paula Branch Line
.
[4]
History
[
edit
]
See also:
CalTrain (Los Angeles)
The railway was originally constructed by the
Southern Pacific Railroad
as their
Coast Line
, connecting Los Angeles to
San Francisco
. The Montalvo Cutoff between Burbank and Ventura via the Simi Valley was built in 1904, bypassing the
old line
further to the north.
Caltrans
ran commuter rail service over the line very briefly in 1982 and 1983, but
CalTrain
was unsustainable due to a number of factors.
In 1990 the
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission
, predecessor of
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
, acquired a portion of the
right of way
between Los Angeles and Moorpark from Southern Pacific and transferred it to the newly formed
Southern California Regional Rail Authority
for commuter service.
[5]
The line began operations in 1992 as one of Metrolink's original three routes, with service from
Moorpark
to
Los Angeles Union Station
in
Downtown Los Angeles
. Service was extended to
Camarillo
and
Oxnard
in 1994 after the
Northridge earthquake
, then to
East Ventura
in 2002.
Because Amtrak trains operate on the same corridor all day, every day, Metrolink did not operate weekend service on the line. As part of a six-month trial program to determine demand, Metrolink added Saturday service on April 6, 2020.
[6]
Permanent Saturday service started on May 29, 2021, with one round trip between LA Union Station and Moorpark.
[7]
Service was extended to Ventura-East on August 9, 2021.
[8]
Metrolink established a code sharing agreement with Amtrak, allowing all Metrolink passengers to ride select Pacific Surfliner trains with any ticket or pass, starting April 4, 2022. The code sharing agreement adds one more morning and early afternoon trip to Ventura, expanding midday and Saturday service, and establishing defacto Sunday service on the line.

At 4:23 p.m. on September 12, 2008, 25 people were killed in a collision between Metrolink commuter train 111 and a freight train. At least 130 people were injured, with at least one dying later at a hospital. The crash occurred on the Ventura County Line near Heather Lee Lane, south of the Ronald Reagan Freeway(SR-118) and east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard.  Both locomotives, the leading car of the commuter train, and seven cars of the freight train were derailed.

Main article:
2015 Oxnard train derailment
On February 24, 2015, according to Oxnard Police Sergeant Denise Shadinger, a Metrolink commuter train traveling from Ventura County to Los Angeles hit a road vehicle near
Oxnard, California
; she initially said there was an unspecified number of injuries. The incident was reported at 5:44 A.M. Three cars derailed, at least one vehicle was fully engulfed at some point, and the three derailed cars were on their sides; the locomotive was still upright. Little but scorched, mangled wreckage in an intersection and on the tracks was left of the truck; Oxnard Fire Department battalion chief Sergio Martinez said the driver fled the scene unhurt but was found and taken into custody. News helicopters and footage from
ABC
affiliate
KABC
showed footage of
triage
tarps lying in the 5th Street (
SR 34
) where on-scene firefighters were treating victims and monitoring the scene. The
National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB), in a tweet, acknowledged the incident and stated they were launching an investigation.

The train engineer died a week later and 29 others were injured. A week after the incident, an
Amtrak
train collided with a vehicle in the same area as the first crash.

Attorney
Thomas James Duncan Fuller
(March 17, 1808 - February 13, 1876) was a
United States representative
from
Maine
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Fuller was born in
Hardwick, Vermont
, on March 17, 1808.
[1]
He was the oldest of four children born to Martin Fuller (1780-1816) and Letitia (Duncan) Fuller (1780-1817), and following the deaths of his parents he was raised by relatives while attending the common schools of
Caldeonia County
.
[2]
Start of career
[
edit
]
Fuller
studied law
with
Isaac Fletcher
at the same time as
Thomas Bartlett Jr.
[3]
He was
admitted to the bar
in 1833 and moved to
Calais, Maine
, to enter into a law partnership with George M. Chase, who had also studied under Fletcher before moving to Maine.
[3]
[4]
Fuller had been active in the
Democratic-Republican Party
(then called Republican, later called Democratic) while living in Vermont,
[5]
[6]
and continued that affiliation in Maine.
[7]
After moving to Maine, Fuller was also active in the state militia, and served as judge advocate of the militia's 7th Division.
[8]
Congressman
[
edit
]
He was elected as a
Democrat
to the
31st Congress
.
[9]
He was reelected three times, and served from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1857.
[9]
He was chairman of the
Committee on Commerce
in the
33rd Congress
.
[10]
His opponent James A. Milliken contested Fuller's 1854 reelection, but the House ruled that Fuller was entitled to the seat.
[11]
In Congress, Fuller aligned himself with northern Democrats who supported concessions on the slavery question as a way to keep the southern states from seceding.  He voted in favor of the
Fugitive Slave Act of 1850
.
[12]
He offered an amendment to the
Kansas-Nebraska Act
which would have left to the territorial legislatures rather than the federal government the decision on whether to allow slavery, in effect allowing slavery north of the
Mason-Dixon line
.
[13]
The amendment failed to pass, and Fuller voted against passage of the final bill.
[14]
At the same time he advocated for concessions on slavery, Fuller also made contributions to the
American Colonization Society
, believing that repatriation of slaves to Africa could also be a way to prevent secession.
[15]
As Maine turned increasingly against slavery and the newly-formed
Republican Party
gained influence, Fuller was increasingly out of step with his constituents.
[9]
He was not a candidate for renomination in 1856.
[9]
Later life
[
edit
]
He was appointed by President
James Buchanan
as Second Auditor of the Treasury and served from April 15, 1857, to August 3, 1861.
[16]
He then engaged in the practice of law before the
United States Supreme Court
and the
Court of Claims
in Washington, D.C.
[9]
During the
American Civil War
, Fuller supported the
Union
, and was active in the Maine Soldiers' Relief Association.
[17]
Death and burial
[
edit
]
He died near
Upperville, Virginia
, on February 13, 1876, after having become ill while visiting his son.
[9]
His was buried at
Oak Hill Cemetery
in Washington, D.C.
[18]
Family
[
edit
]
In 1836, Fuller married Elizabeth Titcomb, who died in 1864.
[19]
[20]
In 1869, he married Jane (Jennie) Elizabeth Doolittle (1840-1923).
[19]
With his first wife, he was the father of son William (1837-1886), a graduate of the
United States Military Academy
who served in the
Union Army
during the
American Civil War
.
[19]
His son with his second wife, Thomas J. D. Fuller Jr. (1870-1940), a prominent Washington, DC architect.

Musical artist
Joacim Bo Persson
(born April 17, 1971) is a Swedish songwriter, producer, music publisher, entrepreneur and one of the founders of Auddly, a venture between
Niclas Molinder
,
Max Martin
and
Björn Ulvaeus
(
ABBA
). With Molinder, he is also part of the writing-producing team
Twin
. Joacim Persson has been writing and producing songs for platinum-selling artists such as
Kelly Clarkson
,
John Legend
,
Kylie Minogue
,
Lady Gaga
,
Jonas Brothers
,
Tokio Hotel
, Mary J. Blige,
Willow Smith
, Iyaz,
Miley Cyrus
, Selena Gomez, Armin van Buuren, Charice,
Ashley Tisdale
, Robyn and Jamiroquai.
Persson had been working with Sebastian Arman since 2017. Their collaboration, called Decco, has produced such songs as
Sun Comes Out
(with Leo Stannard) and
Crazy to Love You
(with
Alex Clare
).
Career
[
edit
]
Persson was born and raised in
Örebro
,
Sweden
. He started out as a guitarist in a local rock band called Fallen Angel. The band signed a deal to German record label Massacre records when Persson was 18, releasing their first album titled Faith Fails. At age twenty-two, Persson formed his second band, Waving Corn, the band signed to Roadrunner Records in Holland. After the release of their album Tearsurf the band decided to split up after three years of intense touring over Europe. 
During the recording of Tearsurf, Persson met engineer
Niclas Molinder
at the studio Eagle One, and together they formed a new production team called Twin.
Twin
[
edit
]
In the beginning Persson and Molinder focused on club remixes and quickly scored a No. 1 dance hit with "La Fiesta" in The Netherlands. The duo then kept delivering remixes for artists such as Jamiroquai, Jennifer Brown, Robyn, Sophie Ellis Bextor,
Kylie Minogue
. TWIN later signed a deal with Zomba Jive as DJ/producers. As part of this agreement, they released the successful singles "A New Day" and "Electrified Love".

Map of Namibia
Land reform
is an important political and economic topic in
Namibia
. It consists of two different strategies: resettlement, and transfer of commercially viable agricultural land. Resettlement is aimed at improving the lives of displaced or dispossessed previously disadvantaged Namibians. Farms obtained by government for resettlement purposes are usually split into several sections, and dozens of families are being resettled on what had previously been one farm. Transfer of commercial agricultural land is not directly conducted by government. Would-be farmers with a previously disadvantaged background obtain farms privately or through
affirmative action
loans. In both cases, the "Willing buyer, willing seller" principle applies.
Namibia contains about 4,000 commercial farms. Almost 1000 of them have been obtained by previously disadvantaged Namibians since independence, some by means of private transactions, and some through government-facilitated loans. Until 2020, a further 15 Mio hectares of commercial agricultural land are to be transferred to blacks, a third of this area for resettlement purposes, two thirds for agriculture.
[1]
Background
[
edit
]
Land ownership in pre-colonial central and southern
South West Africa
was intermittent;
Herero people
and
Nama people
claimed the land they were currently using.
Heinrich Vedder
writes:
[2]
As the Nama said: Where the foot of our hunter sets there is Namaland, so said the Herero: wherever my cattle grassed there is Hereroland.
The notion of permanent ownership of land in the territory of South West Africa was only introduced in the wake of colonialisation. Consequently, the dispossession of land by European settlers from Africans began in the nineteenth century with the coming of
German
colonists and traders as the area was incorporated as
German South West Africa
.
Allocation of land to bantustans according to the
Odendaal Plan
.
During South African occupation of the territory, Namibia was divided along ethnic lines. 10
bantustans
were established, the remaining territory, including much of the agriculturally viable land, was reserved for
Whites
. In the bantustans farm land was communal whereas the farms outside were in private hands. When
Namibia gained independence
in March 1990, the country inherited this division of land in which 3,500 farmers, who were almost entirely Whites, owned approximately 50% of the country's agricultural land. These farmers constituted about 0.2% of the total national population. Land reform was one of the biggest goals for many who participated in Namibia's liberation struggle.
[3]
Reform Strategies
[
edit
]
Prior to the
first democratic election in 1989
, liberation movement leader
SWAPO
committed itself to "transfer[ing] some of the land from the few with too much of it to the landless majority".
[3]
Namibia's land reform process is based on three strategies, outlined by the Agricultural (Commercial) Land Reform Act of 1995:
[4]
Resettlement: The Namibian government buys farms from commercial farmers allocates them to previously disadvantaged people.
Loans:
AgriBank
, a state-owned bank, grants loans with interests below market level to the previously disadvantaged population.
Communal land: Communal land, which all belongs to the state, is parcelled into small units and distributed by
traditional leaders
.
Resettlement
[
edit
]
Farms obtained by government for resettlement purposes are usually split into several sections, and dozens of families are being resettled on what had previously been one farm. From 1990 to 2007, an independent report said that the government had resettled approximately 800 Black farmers on land bought for redistribution. It was approximately 12% of commercial farmland in the country, or less than 1% per year.
[5]
Namibian citizens may obtain a portion of a farm for resettlement if they do not yet own farm land, and if they belong to the previously disadvantaged population. In the allocation process, females score higher than males, people 25 years of age or older score higher than those below 25, and people with farming experience score higher than those without.
[6]
Willing buyer, willing seller
[
edit
]
The government generally has avoided expropriating farms. Farms to be reallocated to  previously disadvantaged people are mainly bought from farm owners that wish to sell their farms. This is called the
Willing buyer, willing seller
principle. Any farm that is to be sold on the free market must first be offered to government. However, in 2005, government began expropriating commercial farms. Although only five farms had been expropriated in 2008, and a further 30 farm owners had received letters asking them to sell to government, this move has instilled fears in the white farming community and discouraged further investment.
[4]
Taxation
[
edit
]
In 2004 a
land value tax
on commercial farmland was introduced as part of the post-independence land reform agenda.  The tax rate was designed to discourage ownership of multiple farms with the tax rate increasing as the number of properties owned increased.  By statute every owner of commercial agricultural land must pay a rate based on the unimproved site value (USV) of the land.  The revenue generated from the land tax is earmarked for the Land Acquisition and Development Fund, that is, primarily for land reform purposes.
The government aims to influence the market by imposing higher tax rates on large or excessive landholdings or on farmland that is not being used.  The land tax rates are progressive, the rationale being that individuals will give up some of their land plots because they cannot afford to pay the tax, as well as to raise much-needed revenue to buy more commercial agricultural land for the resettlement program.
The government invested considerable effort in consultation with key stakeholders including white farmers, and succeeded in securing their general agreement. Because of this process, the introduction of the land tax in Namibia has been described as a success with implications for other countries wishing to undertake land reform.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Dutch historian, writer and poet
Hans Kolfschoten,
Louis Paul Boon
, Hanny Michaelis & Jacques Presser (1967)
Jacob (Jacques) Presser
(24 February 1899 in
Amsterdam
- 30 April 1970 in Amsterdam) was a
Dutch
historian, writer and poet who is known for his book
Ashes in the Wind (The Destruction of the Dutch Jews)
on the history of the
persecution of the Jews in the Netherlands during World War II
. Presser made a significant contribution to Dutch historical scholarship, as well as to
European
historical scholarship.
Early life
[
edit
]
Presser was born in the former
Jewish quarter of Amsterdam
. His family was rather poor (his father was a diamond cutter), and his parents, who were
secular Jews
, had
socialist
leanings. Presser himself in later life, also gravitated towards the left. As a child, he lived for a while with his family in
Antwerp
,
Belgium
.
He attended the
University of Amsterdam
after he finished a commercial vocational college and having worked in an office for two years. At the university, he studied history, art history, and Dutch. He graduated
cum laude
in 1926. Then, he taught history at the newly founded
Vossius Gymnasium
grammar school in Amsterdam.
In 1930, he came into contact with the renowned historian
Jan Romein
, who helped him to get a job as an instructor at the
Instituut voor Historische Leergangen
, which launched his academic career.
Wartime
[
edit
]
Presser was affected by the rising
antisemitism
in
Nazi Germany
and wrote critically about it. When
Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940
, that was a very great shock for him, and he even attempted suicide. Because of the Nazi anti-Jewish policies, he lost his job at Vossius Gymnasium, but he managed to find work as a teacher at the Jewish
Lyceum
.
In early 1943, his wife, Deborah Appel, was arrested and deported to the
Sobibor
death camp, where she died. The loss of his first wife marked Presser for life, but he managed to escape from the Nazis by going into hiding in several places, including in the small town
Lunteren
.
Postwar
[
edit
]
After the war ended, Presser returned to his teaching job at the Vossius Gymnasium, and he was also a lecturer in political history, didactics, and the methodology of history at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Amsterdam.
In 1947, partly at his instigation, the politico-social faculty of law was established at the University, and he began to teach there. From 1948, he was also professor at the Faculty of Arts. His
Marxist
political leanings prevented him from receiving full promotions at the university until 1952. Over the years, he spoke out on political controversies, such as the Dutch
Politionele acties
against Indonesian decolonisation and the activities of U.S. Senator
Joseph McCarthy
against suspected
communists
. He also contributed to the communist daily paper
De Waarheid
shortly after the war. Later, he published in other leftist magazines, such as
Vrij Nederland
and
De Groene Amsterdammer
.
In 1954, Presser married Bertha Hartog, his second wife.
In 1959, he succeeded Jan Romein in his Dutch history chair at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Amsterdam. In 1966, he became a member of the
Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences
.
[1]
Presser retired from his job on 31 May 1969. He died suddenly on 30 April 1970.
[2]
Historical contributions
[
edit
]
One of Presser's most significant works was his extensive biography of
Napoleon Bonaparte
, first published in 1946. In contrast to the common hagiographies of the French emperor, Presser is quite critical of the personality and the political and military activity of Napoleon. Already in the introduction to the book, Presser makes quite clear that one of his main intentions is to try to dispel various euphemisms and legends about Napoleon. Presser depicts him as a ruthless autocrat and the axis of a group of marauders, his marshals. Napoleon comes to the fore as the organizer of the first
modern
dictatorship, which became an example for all later dictatorships. The book also contains extensive chapters on the pillars in French society which he used to strengthen his rule: Propaganda, Police & Justice, the Church, Education and (of course) the Army. Finally, Presser describes the legends about Napoleon in various countries. (The work is available only in Dutch and in German.)
Commissioned by Elsevier Publishers in 1941, Presser wrote a comprehensive history of the
United States
and completed the first version while in hiding. A reworked edition came out in 1949. Shortly after the Second World War, there was a lot of interest in
US history
in the Netherlands. The book is rich in its descriptions, anecdotes and details. The writer explicitly sympathizes with the 'underdogs' in American history: the native Americans, the unfree immigrants ('indentured servants'), the Afro-Americans and the poor. At the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the
US Declaration of Independence
in 1976, a fourth, revised and updated edition was published with a postscript on the period after 1965 by the expert Professor Rob Kroes. Since the book was mainly intended to serve the Dutch reading public, it was never translated.
In 1950, Presser received a commission from the Dutch government to produce a study about the fate of the Dutch Jews during the war. That would later become his historical masterpiece
Ondergang
[The destruction of the Dutch Jews]. He worked on this project for fifteen years and made full use of the vast archives of the
Dutch Institute for War Documentation
. The resulting work was a huge bestseller in the Netherlands when it was published in 1965. It still is the main reference work on the persecution of the Jews in the Netherlands under German occupation. A British edition came out in 1968 and an American edition in 1969, with reprints in 1988 and 2010.
[3]
Presser graphically recounts stories of persecution: the registration, stigmatization, segregation, isolation, spoliation, roundups, the temporary exemptions, life in the transit camps, deportation and ultimately extermination but also stories of Jewish resistance, escape attempts and the process of going into hiding. The author pays attention to the role of the Dutch bureaucracy in the segregation and the isolation of the Jews and conveys the utter despair felt by people whose whole world had crumbled and would be destroyed. Of the Jewish population of some 140,000 in 1940, about 107,000 were deported from the Netherlands to the Nazi concentration and extermination camps from 1941 to 1944. Of those, fewer than 6,000 returned in 1945. An epilogue considers the aftermath on the "postwar Jewish attitude to life".
Presser made a very significant contribution to Dutch historical studies. His book on the Revolt of the Netherlands against Spain (1568-1648), first published in 1941 with a second print in 1942 that was soon prohibited by the German occupiers, was reprinted another four times after the Second World War. Until the late 1970ss it was the only modern, comprehensive historical study on the Dutch Revolt in its entirety. In 1953 Presser introduced the term 'egodocuments' as an umbrella term for texts in which he was especially interested: diaries, memoirs, autobiographies, interviews and personal letters.
[4]
Along with other great historians, such as
Groen van Prinsterer
,
Robert Fruin
,
Huizinga
,
Pieter Geyl
, L.J. Rogier,
Jan Romein
,
Annie Romein-Verschoor
and Arie Th. van Deursen, he can be counted as one of the greatest historians of the Netherlands in the 19th and the 20th centuries.
Besides historical work, Presser also wrote works of literature. His book
The Night of the Girondists
, based on his war time experiences, received literary prizes and became an international best-seller. Set in the Dutch transit camp of
Westerbork
, the leading character of this book is an assimilated Jewish teacher collaborating with the Nazis. His job was to select Jews for transportation to
Auschwitz
, but he later realises that as a Jew, he was also bound to share the fate of those he had sent away.
Presser also wrote poetry and even ventured into the area of crime fiction.

. Enkyklon was most likely used as a wraparound outer garment, a mantle or 'encircling'. It was worn by
ancient Greek
women from the archaic through the
Hellenistic periods
. The garment has been recorded at the ancient Greek sanctuary of Artemis,
Brauron
. Contemporary wraps such as Ampechonon, Epiblēma are also included in the inventories at Delos (Leto, Hera), Brauron, Tanagra and Samos (Hera).

Android Marshmallow
(
codenamed
Android M
during development) is the
sixth major version
of the
Android operating system
developed by
Google
, being the successor to
Android Lollipop
. It was announced at
Google I/O
on May 28, 2015, and released the same day as a
beta
, before being officially released on September 29, 2015. It was succeeded by
Android Nougat
on August 22, 2016.
[5]
Android Marshmallow primarily focuses on improving the overall user experience of its predecessor. It introduced a new opt-in permissions architecture, new APIs for contextual
assistants
(first used by a new feature "
Now on Tap
" to provide context-sensitive search results), a new power management system that reduces background activity when a device is not being physically handled, native support for
fingerprint recognition
and
USB-C
connectors, the ability to migrate data and applications to a
microSD
card, and other internal changes.
Android Marshmallow was met by low adoption numbers, with 13.3% of Android devices running Marshmallow by July 2016.
[6]
Usage of Marshmallow steadily increased since then, and by August 2017, 35.21% of Android devices ran Marshmallow, before receding. As of May 2023
, 1.64% of Android devices ran Marshmallow.
[7]
Security updates for Marshmallow ended in October 2017.
History

Further information:
Android version history § Android 6.0 Marshmallow
Android Marshmallow internally codenamed "Macadamia Nut Cookie".
[8]
The first developer preview build for Marshmallow, codenamed Android "M", was unveiled and released at
Google I/O
on May 28, 2015, for the
Nexus 5
and
Nexus 6
smartphones
, the
Nexus 9
tablet
, and the
Nexus Player
set-top box
.
[9]
[10]
[11]
The second developer preview was released on July 9, 2015,
[12]
[13]
and the third and final preview was released on August 17, 2015, along with announcing that Android M would be titled Android "
Marshmallow
".
[14]
[15]
On September 29, 2015, Google unveiled launch devices for Marshmallow: the
LG
-produced
Nexus 5X
, the
Huawei
-produced
Nexus 6P
,
[16]
[17]
[18]
alongside Google's own
Pixel C
tablet.
[19]
[20]
Android 6.0 updates and factory images for
Nexus 5
,
6
,

, and
Player
were released on October 5, 2015.
[21]
Older Nexus devices, including the
Nexus 4
,
Nexus 7 (2012)
and
Nexus 10
, did not receive an official update.
[22]
On October 14, 2015, LG announced that it planned to release Marshmallow for its flagship
LG G4
smartphone in Poland the following week, marking the first third-party device to receive an update to Marshmallow.
[23]
[24]
Android 6.0.1, a software
patch
featuring security fixes, support for
Unicode 8.0
emoji
(although without supporting skin tone extensions for human emoji), and the return of the "until next alarm" feature in Do Not Disturb mode, was released on December 7, 2015.
[25]
[26]
[27]
System features
[
edit
]
User experience
[
edit
]
A new "Assist"
API
allows information from a currently opened app, including text and a screenshot of the current screen, to be sent to a designated "
assistant
" application for analysis and processing. This system is used by the Google Search app feature "
Google Now on Tap
", which allows users to perform searches within the context of information currently being displayed on-screen. While the "Home" button was used in Android 5 to show available apps, the "Home" button is used now (together with a voice command) to generate on-screen cards which display information, suggestions, and actions related to the content.
[28]
"Direct Share" allows Share menus to display recently used combinations of contacts and an associated app as direct targets.
[28]
Adoptable storage
[
edit
]
The new "Adoptable storage" feature allows a newly-inserted
SD card
[
citation needed
]
to be optionally designated as "internal" rather than "portable" storage.
"Portable" storage is the default behavior used in previous Android versions, treating the media as a secondary storage device for storage of user files, and the storage media can be removed or replaced without repercussions, but user-installed apps are restricted to writing to their respective package name directories located inside
Android/data
. This restriction was introduced in
Android 4.4 KitKat
. The
Storage Access Framework
, through which shared writing access to memory cards has been reinstated in
Android 5.0 Lollipop
, is
backwards-incompatible
and slower due to
latencies
.
[29]
When designated as "Internal" storage, the storage media is reformatted with an encrypted
ext4
file system, and is "adopted" by the operating system as an extension of the primary storage partition. Existing data (including applications and "private" data folders) are migrated to the external storage, and normal operation of the device becomes dependent on the presence of the media. Apps and operating system functions will not function properly if the adopted storage device is removed, and the card can not be reused in other devices until
reformatted
. If the user loses access to the storage media, the adopted storage can be "forgotten", which makes the data permanently inaccessible.
[28]
Samsung
and LG have, however, removed the ability to use an SD card as "internal" storage on their
Galaxy S7
and
G5
devices, with Samsung arguing that the feature could result in unexpected losses of data, and prevents users from being able to transfer data using the card.
[30]
[31]
Platform
[
edit
]
Android Marshmallow introduces a redesigned application permissions model; apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is now used, in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions (such as the ability to access the camera or microphone) to an application when they are needed for the first time. Applications remember the grants, which can be revoked by the user at any time.
[10]
[32]
[33]
The new permissions model is used only by applications developed for Marshmallow using its
software development kit
(SDK), and older apps will continue to use the previous all-or-nothing approach. Permissions can still be revoked for those apps, though this might prevent them from working properly, and a warning is displayed to that effect.
[34]
[35]
Marshmallow introduces new
power management
schemes known as "Doze" and "App Standby"; when running on battery power, a device will enter a low-power state if it is inactive and not being physically handled. In this state, network connectivity and background processing are restricted, and only "high-priority" notifications are processed.
[28]
Additionally, network access by apps is deferred if the user has not recently interacted with the app.
[36]
Apps may request a permission to exempt themselves from these policies, but will be rejected from Google Play Store as a violation of its "Dangerous Products" policy if their core functionality is not "adversely affected" by them.
[36]
[37]
Android Marshmallow provides native support for
fingerprint recognition
on supported devices via a standard
API
, allowing third-party applications to implement fingerprint-based authentication. Fingerprints can be used for unlocking devices and authenticating
Play Store
and
Google Pay
purchases. Android Marshmallow supports
USB-C
, including the ability to instruct devices to charge another device over USB. Marshmallow also introduces "verified links" that can be configured to open directly in their specified application without further user prompts.
[10]
[9]
User data for apps targeting Marshmallow can be automatically backed up to
Google Drive
over Wi-Fi. Each application receives up to 25 MB of storage, which is separate from a user's Google Drive storage allotment.
[28]
As of Marshmallow, the Android Compatibility Definition Document contains new security mandates for devices, dictating that those that are capable of accessing encrypted data without affecting performance must enable secure boot and device encryption by default.
[38]
These conditions comprise part of a specification that must be met in order to be certified for the operating system,
[38]
and be able to license
Google Mobile Services
software.
[39]
The requirement for mandatory device encryption was originally intended to take effect on Lollipop, but was delayed due to performance issues.

enculturation
and
socialization
, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.
A
cultural norm
codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
Accepting only a
monoculture
in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.
[2]
Thus in military culture,
valor
is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the
continuum of conflict
. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.
Cultural change
, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society.
[3]
Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies.
Organizations like
UNESCO
attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.
Description
Pygmy music
has been
polyphonic
well before their discovery by non-African explorers of the
Baka
,
Aka
,
Efe
, and other foragers of the Central African forests, in the 1200s, which is at least 200 years before polyphony developed in Europe. Note the multiple lines of singers and dancers. The motifs are independent, with theme and variation interweaving.
[4]
This type of music is thought to be the first expression of polyphony in world music.
Culture is considered a central concept in
anthropology
, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social
learning
in human
societies
.
Cultural universals
are found in all human societies. These include expressive forms like
art
,
music
,
dance
,
ritual
,
religion
, and
technologies
like
tool usage
,
cooking
,
shelter
, and
clothing
. The concept of
material culture
covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of
social organization
(including practices of
political organization
and social
institutions
),
mythology
,
philosophy
,
literature
(both
written
and
oral
), and
science
comprise the
intangible cultural heritage
of a society.
[5]
In the
humanities
, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in
the arts
, sciences,
education
, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish
civilizations
from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in
class-based
distinctions between a
high culture
of the social
elite
and a
low culture
,
popular culture
, or
folk culture
of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to
cultural capital
. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by
ethnic groups
to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as
body modification
,
clothing
or
jewelry
.
Mass culture
refers to the
mass-produced
and
mass mediated
forms of
consumer culture
that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as
Marxism
and
critical theory
, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the
proletariat
and create a
false consciousness
. Such perspectives are common in the discipline of
cultural studies
. In the wider
social sciences
, the theoretical perspective of
cultural materialism
holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in
evolved biological
dispositions.
When used as a
count noun
, a "culture" is the set of customs,
traditions
, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense,
multiculturalism
values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a
subculture
(e.g. "
bro culture
"), or a
counterculture
. Within
cultural anthropology
, the ideology and analytical stance of
cultural relativism
hold that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.
Etymology
The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the
ancient Roman
orator
Cicero
in his
Tusculanae Disputationes
, where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or
"cultura animi,"
[6]
using an
agricultural
metaphor
for the development of a philosophical soul, understood
teleologically
as the highest possible ideal for human development.
Samuel Pufendorf
took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "
refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original
barbarism
, and through artifice, become fully human."
[7]
In 1986, philosopher
Edward S. Casey
wrote, "The very word
culture
meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin
colere
, 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and
cultus
, 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensely to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."
[8]
Culture described by
Richard Velkley
:
[7]
... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing
Rousseau
's criticism of "
modern
liberalism
and
Enlightenment
." Thus a contrast between "culture" and "
civilization
" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.
In the words of anthropologist
E.B. Tylor
, it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."
[9]
Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.
[10]
The
Cambridge English Dictionary
states that culture is "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time."
[11]
Terror management theory
posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as "person[s] of worth within the world of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that
Homo sapiens
became aware of when they acquired a larger brain.
[12]
[13]
The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with
symbols
and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of
behavioral modernity
in humans around 50,000 years ago and is often thought to be unique to
humans
. However, some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complicated, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that are transmitted through social
interaction
and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

Cultural invention
has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the
human population
explosion, among other factors.

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both
social structures
and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within
current structures
, which themselves are subject to change.
[17]
Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new
cultural models
, and spurring or enabling
generative action
. These social shifts may accompany
ideological
shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S.
feminist movement
involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last
ice age
, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of
agriculture
, which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.
[18]
Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In
diffusion
, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-century.
[19]
"Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another.
Diffusion of innovations
theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.
[20]
Acculturation
has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers to the replacement of traits of one culture with another, such as what happened to certain
Native American
tribes and many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of
colonization
. Related processes on an individual level include
assimilation
(adoption of a different culture by an individual) and
transculturation
. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different cultures and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.
Early modern discourses
German Romanticism
Johann Herder
called attention to national cultures.
Immanuel Kant
(1724-1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of
bildung
: "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."
[21]
He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: "
Sapere Aude
" ("Dare to be wise!"). In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as
Johann Gottfried Herder
(1744-1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of
Bildung
: "For Herder,
Bildung
was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."
[22]
Adolf Bastian
developed a universal model of culture.
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher
Wilhelm von Humboldt
(1767-1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the
Romantic era
, scholars in
Germany
, especially those concerned with
nationalist
movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the
Austro-Hungarian Empire
—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "
worldview
" (
Weltanschauung
).
[23]
According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.
In 1860,
Adolf Bastian
(1826-1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."
[24]
He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (
Elementargedanken
); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (
Völkergedanken
), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.
[25]
This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.
Franz Boas
(1858-1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.
[26]
English Romanticism
British poet and critic
Matthew Arnold
viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.
In the 19th century,
humanists
such as
English
poet and essayist
Matthew Arnold
(1822-1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."
[27]
This concept of culture is also comparable to the
German
concept of
bildung
: "...culture being a pursuit of our total
perfection
by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."
[27]
In practice,
culture
referred to an
elite
ideal and was associated with such activities as
art
,
classical music
, and
haute cuisine
.
[28]
As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from Latin:
civitas
,
lit.
'city'). Another facet of the
Romantic
movement was an interest in
folklore
, which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between
high culture
, namely that of the
ruling
social group
, and
low culture
. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.
[29]
British anthropologist
Edward Tylor
was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.
Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with
anarchy
; other Europeans, following
philosophers
Thomas Hobbes
and
Jean-Jacques Rousseau
, contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the
Native Americans
who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized."
[30]
According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to
Herbert Spencer
's theory of
Social Darwinism
and
Lewis Henry Morgan
's theory of
cultural evolution
. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.
Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and
sophistication
of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature. These critics considered
folk music
(as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed
indigenous peoples
as "
noble savages
" living
authentic
and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified
capitalist
systems of
the West
.
In 1870 the anthropologist
Edward Tylor
(1832-1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the
evolution of religion
. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.
[31]
In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all
human
societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of religion.
Anthropology

Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of culture,
[32]
in the 20th century "culture" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American
anthropology
, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human
experiences
symbolically
, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially.
[33]
American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:
biological anthropology
,
linguistic anthropology
,
cultural anthropology
, and in the United States and Canada,
archaeology
.
[34]
[35]
[36]
[37]
The term
Kulturbrille
, or "culture glasses," coined by German American anthropologist
Franz Boas
, refers to the "lenses" through which a person sees their own culture. Martin Lindstrom asserts that
Kulturbrille
, which allow a person to make sense of the culture they inhabit, "can blind us to things outsiders pick up immediately."
[38]
Sociology
Main article:
Sociology of culture
An example of folkloric dancing in
Colombia
The
sociology of culture
concerns culture as manifested in
society
. For sociologist
Georg Simmel
(1858-1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."
[39]
As such, culture in the
sociological
field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be either of two types,
non-material culture
or
material culture
.
[5]
Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.
Cultural sociology first emerged in
Weimar Germany
(1918-1933), where sociologists such as
Alfred Weber
used the term
Kultursoziologie
('cultural sociology'). Cultural sociology was then reinvented in the English-speaking world as a product of the
cultural turn
of the 1960s, which ushered in
structuralist
and
postmodern
approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating
cultural analysis
and
critical theory
. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead
hermeneutically
focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.
[40]
Culture has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like
social stratification
and
social network analysis
. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead, look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of
social psychology
and
cognitive science
.
[41]
Nowruz
is a good sample of popular and
folklore
culture that is celebrated by people in more than 22 countries with different nations and religions, at the 1st day of spring. It has been celebrated by diverse communities for over 7,000 years.
Early researchers and development of cultural sociology
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like
Marx
,
[42]
Durkheim
, and
Weber
) with the growing discipline of
anthropology
, wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural, sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between
popular culture
, political control, and
social class
were early and lasting concerns in the field.
Cultural studies
Main article:
Cultural studies
In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by
Marxism
such as
Stuart Hall
(1932-2014) and
Raymond Williams
(1921-1988) developed
cultural studies
. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified culture with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film,
food
, sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by
relations of production
, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.
[43]
[44]
In the United Kingdom, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of
popular culture
; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods.
Richard Hoggart
coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham
Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies
or CCCS.
[45]
It has since become strongly associated with
Stuart Hall
,
[46]
who succeeded Hoggart as Director.
[47]
Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as
Western civilization
or
globalism
.
The
Metropolitan Museum of Art
in
Manhattan
.
Visual art
is one expression of culture.
From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues
Paul Willis
,
Dick Hebdige
, Tony Jefferson, and
Angela McRobbie
, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine
political economy
,
communication
,
sociology
,
social theory
,
literary theory
,
media theory
,
film/video studies
,
cultural anthropology
,
philosophy
,
museum studies
, and
art history
to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of
ideology
,
nationality
,
ethnicity
,
social class
, and/or
gender
.
[48]
Cultural studies is concerned with the
meaning
and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching
television
or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to "fit in" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.
In the context of cultural studies, a text includes not only
written language
, but also
films
,
photographs
,
fashion
or
hairstyles
: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.
[49]
Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of culture. Culture, for a cultural-studies researcher, not only includes traditional
high culture
(the culture of
ruling
social groups
)
[50]
and
popular culture
, but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is
comparative cultural studies
, based on the disciplines of
comparative literature
and cultural studies.
[51]
Scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart,
E.P. Thompson
, and
Raymond Williams
, and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the
University of Birmingham
. This included overtly political,
left-wing
views, and criticisms of
popular culture
as "capitalist"
mass culture
; it absorbed some of the ideas of the
Frankfurt School
critique of the "
culture industry
" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and
Paul Gilroy
.
In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."
[52]
The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of,
mass culture
; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of
fandom
.
[

The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.

Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a
Marxist
model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the
Frankfurt School
, but especially from the
structuralist
Marxism of
Louis Althusser
and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of
meaning
. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies
power
as residing with those producing
cultural artifacts
. In a Marxist view, the
mode
and
relations of production
form the economic base of society, which constantly interacts and influences
superstructures
, such as culture.
[53]
Other approaches to cultural studies, such as
feminist
cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book
Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman
(by Paul du Gay
et al.
),
[54]
which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian
Griselda Pollock
contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of
art history
and
psychoanalysis
. The writer
Julia Kristeva
is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical
French feminism
.
[55]
Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:
[56]
The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation,
future orientation
, assertiveness, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance.
The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by
Rein Raud
,
[15]
who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of purposes), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.
Psychology

Cross-cultural psychology
Cognitive tools suggest a way for people from certain culture to deal with real-life problems, like
Suanpan
for Chinese to perform mathematical calculation.
Starting in the 1990s,
[57]
: 31
psychological research on culture influence began to grow and challenge the universality assumed in general psychology.
[58]
: 158-168
[59]
Culture psychologists began to try to explore the relationship between
emotions and culture
, and answer whether the human mind is independent from culture. For example, people from collectivistic cultures, such as the Japanese, suppress their positive emotions more than their American counterparts.
[60]
Culture may affect the way that people experience and express emotions. On the other hand, some researchers try to look for differences between people's
personalities across cultures
.
[61]
[62]
As different cultures dictate distinctive
norms
,
culture shock
is also studied to understand how people react when they are confronted with other cultures. Cognitive tools may not be accessible or they may function differently cross culture.
[57]
: 19
For example, people who are raised in a culture with an
abacus
are trained with distinctive reasoning style.
[63]
Cultural lenses may also make people view the same outcome of events differently. Westerners are more motivated by their successes than their failures, while East Asians are better motivated by the avoidance of failure.
[64]
Culture is important for psychologists to consider when understanding the human mental operation.
Protection of culture
Restoration of an
ancient Egyptian
monument
There are a number of international agreements and national laws relating to the protection of
cultural heritage
and
cultural diversity
.
UNESCO
and its partner organizations such as
Blue Shield International
coordinate international protection and local implementation.
[65]
[66]
The
Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict
and the UNESCO
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions
deal with the protection of culture. Article 27 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
deals with cultural heritage in two ways: it gives people the right to participate in cultural life on the one hand and the right to the protection of their contributions to cultural life on the other.
[67]
In the 21st century, the protection of culture has been the focus of increasing activity by national and international organizations. The
UN
and UNESCO promote cultural preservation and cultural diversity through declarations and legally-binding conventions or treaties. The aim is not to protect a person's property, but rather to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity, especially in the event of war and armed conflict. According to
Karl von Habsburg
, President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is the identity of the opponent, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to affect the particularly sensitive cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or municipality.
[68]
[69]
[70]
Tourism is having an increasing impact on the various forms of culture. On the one hand, this can be physical impact on individual objects or the destruction caused by increasing environmental pollution and, on the other hand, socio-cultural effects on society.

The
history of Australia
is the history of the land and peoples of the continent of
Australia
.
People
first arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from
Maritime Southeast Asia
between 50,000 and 65,000 years ago, and penetrated to all parts of the continent, from the rainforests in the north, the deserts of the
centre
, and the sub-Antarctic islands of Tasmania and Bass Strait. The
artistic
,
musical
and
spiritual
traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.
[1]
The first
Torres Strait Islanders
- ethnically and culturally distinct from the Aboriginal people - arrived from what is now
Papua New Guinea
around 2,500 years ago, and settled in the islands of the Torres Strait and the Cape York Peninsula forming the northern tip of the Australian landmass.
The first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator
Willem Janszoon
on Australia's northern coast. Later that year, Spanish explorer
Luís Vaz de Torres
sailed through, and navigated, what is now called
Torres Strait
and associated islands.
[2]
Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and named the continent
New Holland
.
Macassan trepangers
visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant
James Cook
charted the east coast of Australia and claimed it for Great Britain. He returned to London with accounts favouring colonisation at
Botany Bay
(now in Sydney).
The
First Fleet
of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788 to establish a
penal colony
, the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and
European explorers
ventured into its interior.
Aboriginal people
were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.
Gold rushes
and
agricultural industries
brought prosperity.
Transportation of British convicts
to Australia was phased out from 1840 to 1868. Autonomous parliamentary democracies began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by referendum to unite in a
federation
in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought as part of British Empire and later
Commonwealth
in the two world wars and was to become a long-standing
ally of the United States
when threatened by Imperial Japan during World War II. Trade with Asia increased and a
post-war immigration
program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from almost every country in the world since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 25.5 million by 2020, with 30 per cent of the population born overseas.
Indigenous prehistory
Main article:
History of Indigenous Australians
See also:
Prehistory of Australia
and
Aboriginal history of Western Australia
Rock painting at Ubirr in
Kakadu National Park
. Evidence of
Aboriginal art
in Australia can be traced back some 30,000 years.
Humans
are believed to have arrived in Australia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago.
[3]
[4]
As
hunter-gatherers
, they established enduring
spiritual
and
artistic
traditions and used a range of implements adapted to their environments. Recent estimates of the population at the time of British settlement range from 500,000 to one million.
[5]
[6]
There is considerable archaeological discussion as to the route taken by the first population. People appear to have arrived by sea during a period of glaciation, when New Guinea and Tasmania were joined to the
continent
; however, the journey still required sea travel, making them among the world's earliest mariners.
[7]
Scott Cane
wrote in 2013 that the first wave may have been prompted by the
eruption of Lake Toba
. If they arrived about 70,000 years ago, they could have crossed the water from Timor, when the sea level was low, but if they came later, around 50,000 years ago, a more likely route would have been through the Moluccas to New Guinea. Given that the likely landfall regions have been under approximately 50 metres of water for the past 15,000 years, it is unlikely that the timing will ever be established with certainty.
[8]
The oldest known sites of human occupation in Australia are in
Arnhem Land
in the north of the continent and have been dated to between 50,000 and 65,000 BP. The population spread into a range of very different environments.
Devil's Lair
in the extreme south-west of the continent was occupied around 47,000 BP and Tasmania by 39,000 BP.
[9]
The
earliest known human remains
in Australia, found at
Lake Mungo
, a dry lake in the southwest of New South Wales, are about 40,000 years old.
[10]
Remains found at Mungo suggest one of the world's oldest known cremations, thus indicating early evidence for religious ritual among humans.
[11]
The spread of the population also altered the environment. There is evidence of the deliberate use of fire to shape the Australian environment 46,000 years ago. In many parts of Australia,
firestick farming
was used to clear vegetation to make travel easier, drive animals into ambushes, and create open grasslands rich in animal and vegetable food sources.
[12]
More than 60 species of animals, including
Australian megafauna
, became extinct by 10,000 ago. Researchers have variously attributed these extinctions to human hunting and firing practices, climate change or a combination of these factors.
[13]

Aboriginal Australian
religious practices associated with the
Dreamtime
have been practised for tens of thousands of years.
The inhabitants developed other technologies to better exploit diverse environments. Fibre and nets for use in watercraft and fishing developed before 40,000 BP. More complex tools, such as edge-ground axes hafted to wooden handles, appeared by 35,000 BP.
[14]
Elaborate trade networks also developed. Ochre was transported 250 kilometres from the Barrier Range to Lake Mungo 40,000 years ago.  Shells (for decorative beads) were transported 500 kilometres by 30,000 BP.
[14]
More extensive trade networks developed in later times.
[15]
The earliest
Aboriginal rock art
consists of hand-prints, hand-stencils, and engravings of circles, tracks, lines and cupules, and has been dated to 35,000 years ago. Around 20,000 year ago Aboriginal artists were depicting humans and animals.
[16]
However, the dating is contentious and some researchers believe that known examples of Aboriginal rock art are possibly more recent.
[17]
The Aboriginal population was confronted with significant changes to climate and environment. About 30,000 years ago, sea levels began to fall, temperatures in the south-east of the continent dropped by as much as 9 degrees Celsius, and the interior of Australia became more arid. About 20,000 years ago, New Guinea and Tasmania were connected to the Australian continent, which was more than a quarter larger than today.
[18]
About 19,000 years ago temperatures and sea levels began to rise. Tasmania became separated from the mainland some 14,000 years ago, and between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago thousands of islands in the Torres Strait and around the coast of Australia were formed.
[18]
Josephine Flood writes that the flooding and loss of land as coastlines receded might have led to greater emphasis on territorial boundaries separating groups, stronger clan identity, and the development of the Rainbow Serpent and other mythologies.
[19]
The warmer climate was associated with new technologies. Small back-bladed stone tools appeared 15-19 thousand years ago. Wooden javelins and boomerangs have been found dating from 10,000 years ago. Stone points for spears have been found dating from 5-7 thousand years ago. Spear throwers were probably developed more recently than 6,500 years ago.
[20]
A Luritja man demonstrating his method of attack with a large curved
boomerang

Sea levels stabilised at around their current level about 6,500 years ago. Warmer weather, wetter conditions and the new coastlines led to significant changes in Aboriginal social and economic organisation. New coastal societies emerged around tidal reefs, estuaries and flooded river valleys, and coastal islands were incorporated into local economies.
[21]
There was a proliferation of stone tool, plant processing and landscape modification technologies. Elaborate fish and eel traps involving channels up to three kilometres long were in use in western Victoria from about 6,500 years ago. Semi-permanent collections of wooden huts on mounds also appeared in western Victoria, associated with a more systematic exploitation of new food sources in the wetlands.
[21]
Aboriginal Tasmanians were isolated from the mainland from about 14,000 years ago. As a result, they only possessed one quarter of the tools and equipment of the adjacent mainland and were without hafted axes, grinding technology, stone tipped weapons, spear throwers and the boomerang. By 3,700 BP they had ceased to eat fish and use bone tools. Coastal Tasmanians switched from fish to abalone and crayfish and more Tasmanians moved to the interior.
[22]
The Tasmanians built watercraft from reeds and bark and journeyed up to 10 kilometres offshore to visit islands and hunt for seals and muttonbirds.
[23]
Around 4,000 years ago the first phase of occupation of the Torres Strait Islands began. By 2,500 years ago more of the islands were occupied and a distinctive Torres Strait Island maritime culture emerged. Agriculture also developed on some islands and by 700 years ago villages appeared.
[24]
One genetic study in 2012 has suggested that about 4,000 years ago, some Indian explorers settled in Australia and assimilated into the local population.
[25]
However, more recent studies do not support this view.
[26]
Nevertheless, some innovations were imported to the mainland from neighbouring cultures. The
dingo
was introduced about 4,000 years ago. Shell fish hooks appeared in Australia about 1,200 years ago and were probably introduced from the Torres Strait or by Polynesian seafarers. From the mid-1660s fishing vessels from Indonesia regularly visited the north coast of Australia in search of
trepang
(sea cucumber). Trade and social relationships developed which were reflected in Aboriginal art, ceremonies and oral traditions. Aboriginal people adopted dugout canoes and metal harpoon heads from the Indonesians which allowed them to better hunt dugong and turtle off the coast and nearby islands.
[27]
Despite these interactions with neighbouring cultures, the basic structure of Aboriginal society was unchanged. Family groups were joined in bands and clans averaging about 25 people, each with a defined territory for foraging.  Clans were attached to tribes or nations, associated with particular languages and country. At the time of European contact there were about 600 tribes or nations and 250 distinct languages with various dialects.
[28]
[29]
Aboriginal society was egalitarian with no formal government or chiefs. Authority rested with elders who held extensive ritual knowledge gained over many years. Group decisions were generally made through the consensus of elders. The traditional economy was cooperative, with males generally hunting large game while females gathered local staples such as small animals, shellfish, vegetables, fruits, seeds and nuts. Food was shared within groups and exchanged across groups.
[30]
Aboriginal groups were semi-nomadic, generally ranging over a specific territory defined by natural features. Members of a group would enter the territory of another group through rights established by marriage and kinship or by invitation for specific purposes such as ceremonies and sharing abundant seasonal foods. As all natural features of the land were created by ancestral beings, a group's particular country provided physical and spiritual nourishment.
[31]
[29]
According to
Australian Aboriginal mythology
and the
animist
framework developed in Aboriginal Australia, the
Dreaming
is a sacred era in which ancestral
totemic
spirit beings formed
The Creation
. The Dreaming established the laws and structures of society and the ceremonies performed to ensure continuity of life and land.
[32]
The extent to which some Aboriginal societies were agricultural is controversial. In the Lake Condah region of western Victoria the inhabitants built elaborate eel and fish traps and hundreds gathered in semi-permanent stone and bark huts during the eel season. However, these groups still moved across their territory several times a year to exploit other seasonal food sources.
[33]
In semi-arid areas, millet was harvested, stacked and threshed and the seeds stored for later use. In tropical areas the tops of yams were replanted. Flood argues that such practices are better classified as resource management than agriculture and that Aboriginal societies did not develop the systematic cultivation of crops or permanent villages such as existed in the Torres Strait Islands. Elizabeth Williams has called the inhabitants of the more settled regions of the Murray valley "complex hunter gatherers".

Although a

in the 1520s exists, it lacks definitive evidence.
[35]
[36]
[37]
[38]
The
Dutch East India Company
ship,
Duyfken
, captained by
Willem Janszoon
, made the first documented European landing in Australia in 1606.
[39]
That same year, a Spanish expedition sailing in nearby waters and led by Portuguese navigator
Pedro Fernandes de Queirós
had landed in the
New Hebrides
and, believing them to be the fabled southern continent, named the land "Austrialia del Espiritu Santo" (
Southern Land of the Holy Spirit
), in honour of his queen
Margaret of Austria
, the wife of
Philip III of Spain
.
[40]
[41]
[42]
Later that year, Queirós' deputy
Luís Vaz de Torres
sailed to the north of Australia through
Torres Strait
, along New Guinea's southern coast.
[43]
The Dutch contributed a great deal to Europe's knowledge of Australia's coast.
[44]
In 1616,
Dirk Hartog
, sailing off course, en route from the
Cape of Good Hope
to
Batavia
, landed on an island off
Shark Bay
, Western Australia.
[44]
In 1622-23 the ship
Leeuwin
made the first recorded rounding of the southwest corner of the continent, where
Cape Leeuwin
was later named after her (the name of the ship's captain is lost).
[45]
In 1627, the south coast of Australia was accidentally discovered by
François Thijssen
and named
'
t Land van Pieter Nuyts
, in honour of the highest ranking passenger,
Pieter Nuyts
, extraordinary Councillor of India.
[46]
In 1628, a squadron of Dutch ships was sent by the
Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies
Pieter de Carpentier
to explore the northern coast. These ships made extensive examinations, particularly in the
Gulf of Carpentaria
, named in honour of de Carpentier.
[45]
Abel Tasman
's voyage of 1642 was the first known European expedition to reach
Van Diemen's Land
(later Tasmania) and
New Zealand
, and to sight
Fiji
. On his second voyage of 1644, he also contributed significantly to the mapping of the Australian mainland (which he called
New Holland
), making observations on the land and people of the north coast below New Guinea.
[47]
Following Tasman's voyages, the Dutch were able to make almost complete maps of Australia's northern and western coasts and much of its southern and south-eastern Tasmanian coasts, as reflected in the 1648 map by
Joan Blaeu
,
Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula.
[48]
British and French exploration
Lieutenant
James Cook
, the first European to map the eastern coastline of Australia in 1770
William Dampier
, an English buccaneer and explorer, landed on the north-west coast of New Holland in 1688 and again in 1699, and
published
influential descriptions of the Aboriginal people.
[49]
In 1769, Lieutenant
James Cook
in command of
HMS
Endeavour
, travelled to
Tahiti
to observe and record the
transit of Venus
. Cook also carried secret Admiralty instructions to locate the supposed
Southern Continent
.
[50]
This continent was not found, a disappointment to
Alexander Dalrymple
and his fellow members of the Royal Society who had urged the Admiralty to undertake this mission.
[51]
Cook decided to survey the east coast of New Holland, the only major part of that continent that had not been charted by Dutch navigators.
[52]
On 19 April 1770 the
Endeavour
reached the east coast of New Holland and ten days later anchored at
Botany Bay
. Cook charted the coast to its northern extent and formally took possession of the east coast of New Holland on 21/22 August 1770 when on
Possession Island
off the west coast of
Cape York Peninsula
.

He noted in his journal that he could "land no more upon this Eastern coast of New Holland, and on the Western side I can make no new discovery the honour of which belongs to the Dutch Navigators
and as such they may lay Claim to it as their property
[italicised words crossed out in the original] but the Eastern Coast from the Latitude of 38 South down to this place I am confident was never seen or viseted by any European before us and

In March 1772
Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne
, in command of two French ships, reached Van Diemen's land on his way to Tahiti and the South Seas. His party became the first recorded Europeans to encounter the Indigenous Tasmanians and to kill one of them.
[56]
In the same year, a French expedition led by
Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn
, became the first Europeans to formally claim sovereignty over the west coast of Australia, but no attempt was made to follow this with colonisation.

Although various proposals for the colonisation of Australia were made prior to 1788, none were attempted. In 1717,
Jean-Pierre Purry
sent a plan to the Dutch East India Company for the colonisation of an area in modern South Australia. The company rejected the plan with the comment that, "There is no prospect of use or benefit to the Company in it, but rather very certain and heavy costs".
[58]
In contrast,
Emanuel Bowen
, in 1747, promoted the benefits of exploring and colonising the country, writing:
[59]
It is impossible to conceive a Country that promises fairer from its Situation than this of
TERRA AUSTRALIS
, no longer incognita, as this Map demonstrates, but the Southern Continent Discovered. It lies precisely in the richest climates of the World... and therefore whoever perfectly discovers and settles it will become infalliably possessed of Territories as Rich, as fruitful, and as capable of Improvement, as any that have hitherto been found out, either in the East Indies or the West.
John Harris'
Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels
(1744-1748, 1764) recommended exploration of the east coast of New Holland, with a view to a British colonisation, by way of Abel Tasman's route to Van Diemen's Land.
[60]
John Callander
put forward a proposal in 1766 for Britain to found a colony of banished convicts in the South Sea or in
Terra Australis
to enable the mother country to exploit the riches of those regions. He said: "this world must present us with many things entirely new, as hitherto we have had little more knowledge of it, than if it had lain in another planet".
[61]
Sweden's King
Gustav III
had ambitions to establish a colony for his country at the Swan River in 1786 but the plan was stillborn.
[62]
Sixteen years after Cook's landfall on the east coast of Australia, the British government decided to establish a colony at
Botany Bay
.
The
American Revolutionary War
(1775-1783) saw Britain lose most of its North American colonies and consider establishing replacement territories. Britain had transported about 50,000 convicts to the New World from 1718 to 1775 and was now searching for an alternative. The temporary solution of floating prison hulks had reached capacity and was a public health hazard, while the option of building more jails and workhouses was deemed too expensive.
[63]
[64]
In 1779,
Sir Joseph Banks
, the eminent scientist who had accompanied
James Cook
on his 1770 voyage, recommended Botany Bay as a suitable site for a penal settlement. Banks's plan was to send 200 to 300 convicts to Botany Bay where they could be left to their own devices and not be a burden on the British taxpayer.
[65]
Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770
Under Banks's guidance, the American
Loyalist
James Matra
, who had also travelled with Cook, produced a new plan for colonising New South Wales in 1783.
[66]
Matra argued that the country was suitable for plantations of sugar, cotton and tobacco; New Zealand timber and hemp or flax could prove valuable commodities; it could form a base for Pacific trade; and it could be a suitable compensation for displaced American Loyalists.
[67]
Following an interview with Secretary of State
Lord Sydney
in 1784, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers, considering that this would benefit both "Economy to the Publick, & Humanity to the Individual".
[68]
The London newspapers announced in November 1784 that: "A plan has been presented to the [Prime] Minister, and is now before the Cabinet, for instituting a new colony in New Holland. In this vast tract of land....every sort of produce and improvement of which the various soils of the earth are capable, may be expected".
[69]
The major alternative to Botany Bay was sending convicts to Africa. From 1775 convicts had been sent to garrison British forts in west Africa, but the experiment had proved unsuccessful. In 1783, the Pitt government considered exiling convicts to a small river island in Gambia where they could form a self-governing community, a "colony of thieves", at no expense to the government.
[70]
In 1785, a parliamentary select committee chaired by Lord Beauchamp recommended against the Gambia plan, but failed to endorse the alternative of Botany Bay. In a second report, Beauchamp recommended a penal settlement at Das Voltas Bay in modern Namibia. The plan was dropped, however, when an investigation of the site in 1786 found it to be unsuitable. Two weeks later, In August 1786, the Pitt government announced its intention to send convicts to Botany Bay.
[71]
The Government incorporated the settlement of
Norfolk Island
into their plan, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Banks's Royal Society colleagues,
Sir John Call
and Sir George Young.
[72]
There has been a longstanding debate over whether the key consideration in the decision to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay was the pressing need to find a solution to the penal management problem, or whether broader imperial goals — such as trade, securing new supplies of timber and flax for the navy, and the desirability of strategic ports in the region — were paramount.
[73]
Leading historians in the debate have included
Sir Ernest Scott
,
[74]
Geoffrey Blainey
,
[75]
and
Alan Frost
.
[76]
The decision to settle was taken when it seemed the outbreak of civil war in the Netherlands might precipitate a war in which Britain would be again confronted with the alliance of the three naval Powers, France, Holland and Spain, which had brought her to defeat in 1783. Under these circumstances a naval base in New South Wales which could facilitate attacks on Dutch and Spanish interests in the region would be attractive.
[77]
[78]
Specific plans for using the colony as a strategic base against Spanish interests were occasionally made after 1788, but never implemented.
[79]
Macintyre argues that the evidence for a military-strategic motive in establishing the colony is largely circumstantial and hard to reconcile with the strict ban on establishing a shipyard in the colony.  Karskens points out that the instructions provided to the first five governors of New South Wales show that the initial plans for the colony were limited.
[80]
The settlement was to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade, shipping and ship building were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated and so as not to interfere with the trade monopoly of the
British East India Company
. There was no plan for economic development apart from investigating the possibility of producing raw materials for Britain.
[81]
Christopher and Maxwell-Stewart argue that whatever the government's original motives were in establishing the colony, by the 1790s it had at least achieved the imperial objective of providing a harbour where vessels could be careened and resupplied.

The territory of New South Wales claimed by Britain included all of Australia eastward of the meridian of 135° East. This included more than half of mainland Australia and reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the
Treaty of Tordesillas
in 1494.
[83]
Watkin Tench
subsequently commented in
A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay
, "By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory".
[84]
The claim also included "all the Islands adjacent in the Pacific" between the latitudes of
Cape York
and the southern tip of
Van Diemen's Land
(Tasmania).
[85]
King argues that an unofficial British map published in 1786 (
A General Chart of New Holland
) showed the possible extend of this claim. In 1817, the
British government
withdrew the extensive territorial claim over the South Pacific, passing an act specifying that Tahiti, New Zealand and other islands of the South Pacific were not within His Majesty's dominions.
[83]
However, it is unclear whether the claim ever extended to the current islands of New Zealand.
[86]
The
colony of New South Wales
was established with the arrival of the
First Fleet
of 11 vessels under the command of Captain
Arthur Phillip
in January 1788. It consisted of more than a thousand settlers, including 778 convicts (192 women and 586 men).
[87]
A few days after arrival at
Botany Bay
the fleet moved to the more suitable
Port Jackson
where a settlement was established at
Sydney Cove
on 26 January 1788.
[88]
This date later became Australia's national day,
Australia Day
. The colony was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip described as being, 'with out exception the finest Harbour in the World [...] Here a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security'.
[89]
Arthur Phillip
, first
Governor of New South Wales
Founding of the settlement of Port Jackson at Botany Bay in New South Wales in 1788
- Thomas Gosse
Governor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. His personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers—most notably Watkin Tench—left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney. Many new arrivals were sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the
Second Fleet
which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the
Third Fleet
appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.
[90]
In 1788, Phillip established a subsidiary settlement on
Norfolk Island
in the South Pacific where he hoped to obtain timber and flax for the navy. The island, however, had no safe harbour, which led the settlement to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.
[91]
The island was subsequently re-established as a site for secondary transportation in 1825.
[92]
Phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils, fixed on the
Parramatta
region as a promising area for expansion, and moved many of the convicts from late 1788 to establish a small township, which became the main centre of the colony's economic life. This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and
Toongabbie
, but a building program, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population; however, a free population soon began to grow, consisting of emancipated convicts, locally born children, soldiers whose military service had expired and, finally, free settlers from Britain. Governor Phillip departed the colony for England on 11 December 1792, with the new settlement having survived near starvation and immense isolation for four years.
[90]
A number of foreign commentators pointed to the strategic importance of the new colony. Spanish naval commander
Alessandro Malaspina
, who visited Sydney in March-April 1793 reported to his government that: "The transportation of the convicts constituted the means and not the object of the enterprise. The extension of dominion, mercantile speculations and the discovery of mines were the real object."
[93]
Frenchman
François Péron
, of the
Baudin expedition
visited Sydney in 1802 and reported to the French Government: "How can it be conceived that such a monstrous invasion was accomplished, with no complaint in Europe to protest against it? How can it be conceived that Spain, who had previously raised so many objections opposing the occupation of the Malouines (
Falkland Islands
), meekly allowed a formidable empire to arise to facing her richest possessions, an empire which must either invade or liberate them?"
[94]
King points out that supporters of the penal colony frequently compared the venture to the foundation of Rome, and that the first Great Seal of New South Wales alluded to this. Phillip, however, wrote, "I would not wish Convicts to lay the foundations of an Empire...[.]"
[95]
Consolidation: 1793 to 1821
Governor
William Bligh
After the departure of Phillip, the colony's military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods obtained from visiting ships. Former convicts also farmed land granted to them and engaged in trade. Farms spread to the more fertile lands surrounding
Paramatta
,
Windsor
and
Camden
, and by 1803 the colony was self-sufficient in grain. Boat building developed in order to make travel easier and exploit the marine resources of the coastal settlements. Sealing and whaling became important industries.

The
New South Wales Corps
was formed in England in 1789 as a permanent regiment of the
British Army
to relieve the marines who had accompanied the First Fleet. Officers of the Corps soon became involved in the corrupt and lucrative rum trade in the colony. Governor
William Bligh
(1806 -- 1808) tried to suppress the rum trade and the illegal use of Crown Land, resulting in the
Rum Rebellion
of 1808. The Corps, working closely with the newly established wool trader
John Macarthur
, staged the only successful armed takeover of government in Australian history, deposing Bligh and instigating a brief period of military rule prior to the arrival from Britain of Governor
Lachlan Macquarie
in 1810.
[97]
[98]
Macquarie served as the last autocratic
Governor of New South Wales
, from 1810 to 1821, and had a leading role in the social and economic development of New South Wales which saw it transition from a
penal colony
to a budding civil society. He established a bank, a currency and a hospital. He employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney and commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches, and public buildings. He sent explorers out from Sydney and, in 1815, a road across the
Blue Mountains
was completed, opening the way for large scale farming and grazing in the lightly-wooded pastures west of the
Great Dividing Range
.
[99]
[100]
Central to Macquarie's policy was his treatment of the
emancipists
, whom he considered should be treated as social equals to free-settlers in the colony. He appointed emancipists to key government positions including
Francis Greenway
as colonial architect and
William Redfern
as a magistrate. His policy on emancipists was opposed by many influential free settlers, officers and officials, and London became concerned at the cost of his public works. In 1819, London appointed
J. T. Bigge
to conduct an inquiry into the colony, and Macquarie resigned shortly before the report of the inquiry was published.
[101]
[102]
Expansion: 1821 to 1850
Map of the south eastern portion of Australia, 1850
In 1820, British settlement was largely confined to a 100 kilometre radius around Sydney and to the central plain of Van Diemen's land. The settler population was 26,000 on the mainland and 6,000 in Van Diemen's Land. Following the end of the
Napoleonic Wars
in 1815 the transportation of convicts increased rapidly and the number of free settlers grew steadily.
[103]
From 1821 to 1840, 55,000 convicts arrived in New South Wales and 60,000 in Van Diemen's Land. However, by 1830, free settlers and the locally born exceeded the convict population of New South Wales.
[104]
From the 1820s
squatters
increasingly established unauthorised cattle and sheep runs beyond the official limits of the settled colony. In 1836, a system of annual licences authorising grazing on Crown Land was introduced in an attempt to control the
pastoral industry
, but booming wool prices and the high cost of land in the settled areas encouraged further squatting. By 1844 wool accounted for half of the colony's exports and by 1850 most of the eastern third of New South Wales was controlled by fewer than 2,000 pastoralists.
[105]
[106]
In 1825, the western boundary of New South Wales was extended to longitude 129° East, which is the current boundary of Western Australia. As a result, the territory of New South Wales reached its greatest extent, covering the area of the modern state as well as modern Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory.
[107]
[86]
By 1850 the settler population of New South Wales had grown to 180,000, not including the 70-75 thousand living in the area which became the separate colony of Victoria in 1851.
[108]
Establishment of further colonies
Van Diemen's Land
Main article:
History of Tasmania
After hosting
Nicholas Baudin's
French naval expedition in Sydney in 1802,  Governor
Phillip Gidley King
decided to establish a settlement in
Van Diemen's Land
(modern
Tasmania
) in 1803, partly to forestall a possible French settlement. The British settlement of the island soon centred on Launceston in the north and Hobart in the south. For the first two decades the settlement relied heavily on convict labour, small-scale farming and sheep grazing, sealing, whaling and the "dog and kangaroo" economy where emancipists and escaped convicts hunted native game with guns and dogs.
[109]
[110]
From the 1820s free settlers were encouraged by the offer of land grants in proportion to the capital the settlers would bring. Almost 2 million acres of land was granted to free settlers in the decade, and the number of sheep in the island increased from 170,000 to a million. The land grants created a social division between large landowners and a majority of landless convicts and emancipists.
[111]
[112]
Van Diemen's Land became a separate colony from New South Wales in December 1825 and continued to expand through the 1830s, supported by farming, sheep grazing and whaling. Following the suspension of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840, Van Diemen's land became the main destination for convicts. Transportation to Van Diemen's Land ended in 1853 and in 1856 the colony officially changed its name to Tasmania.

Pastoralists from Van Diemen's land began squatting in the

hinterland on the mainland in 1834, attracted by its rich grasslands. In 1835,
John Batman
and others negotiated the transfer of 100,000 acres of land from the Kulin people. However, the treaty was annulled the same year when the British
Colonial Office
issued the
Proclamation of
Governor Bourke
stating that all unalienated land in the colony was vacant Crown Land, irrespective of whether it was occupied by
traditional landowners
. Its publication meant that from then, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers.
[114]
In 1836, Port Phillip was officially recognised as a district of New South Wales and opened for settlement. The main settlement of Melbourne was established in 1837 as a planned town on the instructions of Governor Bourke. Squatters and settlers from Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales soon arrived in large numbers, and by 1850 the district had a population of 75,000 Europeans, 2,000 Indigenous inhabitants and 5 million sheep. In 1851, the Port Phillip District separated from New South Wales as the colony of Victoria.

In 1826, the governor of New South Wales,

, sent a military garrison to
King George Sound
(the basis of the later town of
Albany
), to deter the French from establishing a settlement in Western Australia. In 1827, the head of the expedition,
Major Edmund Lockyer
, formally annexed the western third of the continent as a British colony.
[117]
In 1829, the Swan River colony was established at the sites of modern
Fremantle
and
Perth
, becoming the first convict-free and privatised colony in Australia. However, much of the arable land was allocated to absentee owners and the development of the colony was hampered by poor soil, the dry climate, and a lack of capital and labour. By 1850 there were a little more than 5,000 settlers, half of them children. The colony accepted convicts from that year because of the acute shortage of labour.

Main article:
History of South Australia
The Province of South Australia was established in 1836 as a privately financed settlement based on the theory of "systematic colonisation" developed by
Edward Gibbon Wakefield
. The intention was to found a free colony based on private investment at little cost to the British government. Power was divided between the Crown and a Board of Commissioners of Colonisation, responsible to about 300 shareholders. Settlement was to be controlled to promote a balance between land, capital and labour. Convict labour was banned in the hope of making the colony more attractive to "respectable" families and promote an even balance between male and female settlers. The city of
Adelaide
was to be planned with a generous provision of churches, parks and schools. Land was to be sold at a uniform price and the proceeds used to secure an adequate supply of labour through selective assisted migration.
[120]
[121]
[122]
Various religious, personal and commercial freedoms were guaranteed, and the
Letters Patent
enabling the
South Australia Act 1834
included a guarantee of the rights of 'any Aboriginal Natives' and their descendants to lands they 'now actually occupied or enjoyed'.
[123]
The colony was badly hit by the depression of 1841-44, and overproduction of wheat and overinvestment in infrastructure almost bankrupted it. Conflict with Indigenous traditional landowners also reduced the protections they had been promised. In 1842, the settlement became a Crown colony administered by the governor and an appointed Legislative Council. The economy recovered from 1845, supported by wheat farming, sheep grazing and a boom in copper mining. By 1850 the settler population had grown to 60,000 and the following year the colony achieved limited self-government with a partially elected Legislative Council.

Brisbane
(Moreton Bay Settlement), 1835; watercolor by H. Bowerman
In 1824, the
Moreton Bay penal settlement
was established on the site of present day
Brisbane
as a place of secondary punishment. In 1842, the penal colony was closed and the area was opened for free settlement. By 1850 the population of Brisbane had reached 8,000 and increasing numbers of pastoralists were grazing cattle and sheep in the Darling Downs west of the town. However, several attempts to establish settlements north of the Tropic of Capricorn had failed, and the settler population in the north remained small. Frontier violence between settlers and the Indigenous population became severe as pastoralism expanded north of the
Tweed River
.
A series of disputes between northern pastoralists and the government in Sydney led to increasing demands from the northern settlers for separation from New South Wales. In 1857, the British government agreed to the separation and in 1859 the colony of Queensland was proclaimed. The settler population of the new colony was 25,000 and the vast majority of its territory was still occupied by its
traditional owners
.

Convicts and colonial society
Convicts and emancipists
Main article:
Convicts in Australia
Black-eyed Sue and Sweet Poll of Plymouth, England mourning their lovers who are soon to be transported to Botany Bay
(published in London in 1792)
Between 1788 and 1868, approximately 161,700 convicts (of whom 25,000 were women) were transported to the Australian colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land and Western Australia.
[128]
Historian Lloyd Robson has estimated that perhaps two-thirds were thieves from working class towns, particularly from
the Midlands
and north of England. The majority were repeat offenders.
[129]
The literacy rate of convicts was above average and they brought a range of useful skills to the new colony including building, farming, sailing, fishing and hunting.
[130]
The small number of free settlers meant that early governors also had to rely on convicts and emancipists for professions such as lawyers, architects, surveyors and teachers.
[131]
The first governors saw New South Wales as a place of punishment and reform of convicts. Convicts worked on government farms and public works such as land clearing and building. After 1792 the majority were assigned to work for private employers including emancipists (as transported convicts who had completed their sentence or had been pardoned called themselves). Emancipists were granted small plots of land for farming and a year of government rations. Later they were assigned convict labour to help them work their farms.
[132]
Some convicts were assigned to military officers to run their businesses because the officers did not want to be directly associated with trade. These convicts learnt commercial skills which could help them work for themselves when their sentence ended or they were granted a "ticket of leave" (a form of parole).
[133]
A "

Hobart
, c.1831
Convicts soon established a system of piece work which allowed them to work for wages once their allocated tasks were completed. Due to the shortage of labour, wage rates before 1815 were high for male workers although much lower for females engaged in domestic work.
[134]
In 1814, Governor Macquarie ordered that convicts had to work until 3 p.m. after which private employers had to pay them wages for any additional work.
[135]
By 1821 convicts, emancipists and their children owned two-thirds of the land under cultivation, half the cattle and one-third of the sheep.
[136]
They also worked in trades and small business. Emancipists employed about half of the convicts assigned to private masters.
[137]
After 1815 wages and employment opportunities for convicts and emancipists deteriorated as a sharp increase in the number of convicts transported led to an oversupply of labour. A series of reforms recommended by J. T. Bigge in 1822 and 1823 also sought to change the nature of the colony and make transportation "an object of real terror". The food ration for convicts was cut and their opportunities to work for wages restricted.
[138]
More convicts were assigned to rural work gangs, bureaucratic control and surveillance of convicts was made more systematic, isolated penal settlements were established as places of secondary punishment, the rules for tickets of leave were tightened, and land grants were skewed to favour free settlers with large capital.
[139]
As a result, convicts who arrived after 1820 were far less likely to become property owners, to marry, and to establish families.
[140]
Free settlers
The humanitarian
Caroline Chisholm
was a leading advocate for women's issues and family friendly colonial policy.
The Bigge reforms also aimed to encourage affluent free settlers by offering them land grants for farming and grazing in proportion to their capital. From 1831 the colonies replaced land grants with land sales by auction at a fixed minimum price per acre, the proceeds being used to fund the assisted migration of workers. From 1821 to 1850 Australia attracted 200,000 immigrants from the United Kingdom. Although most immigrants settled in towns, many were attracted to the high wages and business opportunities available in rural areas. However, the system of land grants, and later land sales, led to the concentration of land in the hands of a small number of affluent settlers.
[141]
Two-thirds of the migrants to Australia during this period received assistance from the British or colonial governments.
[142]
Healthy young workers without dependants were favoured for assisted migration, especially those with experience as agricultural labourers or domestic workers. Families of convicts were also offered free passage and about 3,500 migrants were selected under the
English Poor Laws
. Various special-purpose and charitable schemes,  such as those of
Caroline Chisholm
and
John Dunmore Lang
, also provided migration assistance.
[143]
Women
Businesswoman
Elizabeth Macarthur
helped establish the merino wool industry.
Colonial Australia was characterised by an imbalance of the sexes as women comprised only about 15 per cent of convicts transported. The first female convicts brought a range of skills including experience as domestic workers, dairy women and farm workers. Due to the shortage of women in the colony they were more likely to marry than men and tended to choose older, skilled men with property as husbands. The early colonial courts enforced the property rights of women independently of their husbands, and the ration system also gave women and their children some protection from abandonment. Women were active in business and agriculture from the early years of the colony, among the most successful being the former convict turned entrepreneur
Mary Reibey
and the agriculturalist
Elizabeth Macarthur
.
[144]
One-third of the shareholders of the first colonial bank (founded in 1817) were women.
[145]
One of the goals of the assisted migration programs from the 1830s was to promote migration of women and families to provide a more even gender balance in the colonies. The philanthropist Caroline Chisholm established a shelter and labour exchange for migrant women in New South Wales in the 1840s and promoted the settlement of single and married women in rural areas where she hoped they would have a civilising influence on rough colonial manners and act as "God's police".

Between 1830 and 1850 the female proportion of the Australian settler population increased from 24 per cent to 41 per cent.
[148]
Religion
The early chaplains of the colony were also civil magistrates with the power to discipline convicts and grant tickets of leave. The
Church of England
was the only recognised church before 1820 and its clergy worked closely with the governors.
Richard Johnson
, (chief chaplain 1788-1802) was charged by Governor
Arthur Phillip
, with improving "public morality" in the colony and was also heavily involved in health and education.
[149]
Samuel Marsden
(various ministries 1795-1838) became known for his missionary work, the severity of his punishments as a magistrate, and the vehemence of his public denunciations of Catholicism and Irish convicts.
[150]
A painting depicting the
Castle Hill Rebellion
of 1804
About a quarter of convicts were Catholics and they frequently requested a Catholic priest to perform their rites. The lack of official recognition of Catholicism was combined with suspicion of Irish convicts which only increased after the Irish-led
Castle Hill Rebellion
of 1804.
[151]
[152]
Only two Catholic priests operated temporarily in the colony before Governor Macquarie appointed official Catholic chaplains in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land in 1820.
[153]
The Bigge reports recommended that the status of the Anglican Church be enhanced as source of stability and moral authority in the colony. An Anglican archdeacon was appointed in 1824 and allocated a seat in the first advisory Legislative Council. The Anglican clergy and schools also received state support. This policy was changed under Governor Burke by the Church Acts of 1836 and 1837. The government now provided state support for the clergy and church buildings of the four largest denominations: Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian and, later, Methodist.
[153]
The Church Acts did not alleviate sectarianism as many Anglicans saw state support of the Catholic Church as a threat. The prominent Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang also promoted sectarian divisions in the 1840s.
[154]
[155]
State support, however, led to a growth in church activities. Charitable associations such as the Catholic
Sisters of Charity
, founded in 1838, provided hospitals, orphanages and asylums for the old and disabled. Religious organisations were also the main providers of school education in the first half of the nineteenth century, a notable example being Lang's Australian College which opened in 1831. Many religious associations, such as the
Sisters of St Joseph
, co-founded by
Mary MacKillop
in 1866, continued their educational activities after the provision of secular state schools grew from the 1850s.

[158]
In 1801-02 Matthew Flinders in

led the first circumnavigation of Australia. Aboard ship was the Aboriginal explorer
Bungaree
, of the Sydney district, who became the first person born on the Australian continent to circumnavigate the Australian continent.
[158]
Matthew Flinders
led the first successful circumnavigation of Australia in 1801-02.
In 1798, the former convict John Wilson and two companions crossed the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, in an expedition ordered by Governor Hunter. Hunter suppressed news of the feat for fear that it would encourage convicts to abscond from the settlement. In 1813,
Gregory Blaxland
,
William Lawson
and
William Wentworth
crossed the mountains by a different route and a road was soon built to the
Central Tablelands
.
[159]
In 1824, the Governor
Sir Thomas Brisbane
, commissioned
Hamilton Hume
and former Royal Navy Captain
William Hovell
to lead an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the colony, and also to find an answer to the mystery of where New South Wales' western rivers flowed. Over 16 weeks in 1824-25,
Hume and Hovell journeyed
to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries including the
Murray River
(which they named the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing lands between
Gunning, New South Wales
and
Corio Bay
,
Port Phillip
.
[160]
Charles Sturt
led an expedition along the
Macquarie River
in 1828 and discovered the
Darling River
. A theory had developed that the inland rivers of New South Wales were draining into an inland sea. Leading a second expedition in 1829, Sturt followed the
Murrumbidgee River
into a 'broad and noble river', which he named the Murray River. His party then followed this river to its junction with the
Darling River
. Sturt continued down river on to
Lake Alexandrina
, where the Murray meets the sea in South Australia.
[161]
Surveyor General Sir
Thomas Mitchell
conducted a series of expeditions from the 1830s to 'fill in the gaps' left by these previous expeditions. Mitchell employed three Aboriginal guides and was meticulous in recording the Aboriginal place names around the colony. He also recorded a violent encounter with traditional owners on the Murray in 1836 in which his men pursued them, "shooting as many as they could."
[162]

The Polish scientist and explorer Count
Paul Edmund Strzelecki
conducted surveying work in the

Mount Kosciuszko
in honour of the Polish patriot
Tadeusz Kościuszko

Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21 April 1861
European explorers penetrated deeper into the interior in the 1840s in a quest to discover new lands for agriculture or answer scientific enquiries. The German scientist
Ludwig Leichhardt
led three expeditions in northern Australia in this decade, sometimes with the help of Aboriginal guides, identifying the grazing potential of the region and making important discoveries in the fields of botany and geology. He and his party disappeared in 1848 while attempting to cross the continent from east to west.
[166]
Edmund Kennedy
led an expedition into what is now far-western Queensland in 1847 before being speared by Aborigines in the Cape York Peninsula in 1848.
[167]
In 1860,
Burke and Wills
led the first south-north crossing of the continent from Melbourne to the
Gulf of Carpentaria
. Lacking bushcraft and unwilling to learn from the local Aboriginal people, Burke and Wills died in 1861, having returned from the Gulf to their rendezvous point at
Coopers Creek
only to discover the rest of their party had departed the location only a matter of hours previously. They became tragic heroes to the European settlers, their funeral attracting a crowd of more than 50,000 and their story inspiring numerous books, artworks, films and representations in popular culture.
[168]

In 1862,
John McDouall Stuart
succeeded in traversing Central Australia from south to north. His expedition mapped out the route which was later followed by the
Australian Overland Telegraph Line

Impact of British settlement on Indigenous population
When the First Fleet arrived in Sydney Cove with some 1,300 colonists in January 1788 the Aboriginal population of the Sydney region is estimated to have been about 3,000 people.
[173]
The first
governor
of New South Wales,
Arthur Phillip
, arrived with instructions to: "endeavour by every possible means to open an Intercourse with the Natives and to conciliate their affections, enjoining all Our Subjects to live in amity and kindness with them."
[174]
Alexander Schramm's

(1850) depicts German settlers with Aborigines
Disease
The relative isolation of the Indigenous population for some 60,000 years meant that they had little resistance to many introduced diseases. An outbreak of smallpox in April 1789 killed about half the Aboriginal population of the Sydney region while only one death was recorded among the settlers. The source of the outbreak is
controversial
; some researchers contend that it originated from contact with Indonesian fisherman in the far north and spread along Aboriginal trade routes while others argue that it is more likely to have been deliberately spread by settlers.
[175]
[176]
There were further smallpox outbreaks devastating Aboriginal populations from the late 1820s (affecting south-eastern Australia), in the early 1860s (travelling inland from the Coburg Peninsula in the north to the Great Australian Bight in the south), and in the late 1860s (from the Kimberley to Geraldton). According to Josphine Flood, the estimated Aboriginal mortality rate from smallpox was 60 per cent on first exposure, 50 per cent in the tropics, and 25 per cent in the arid interior.
[177]
Further information:
Smallpox in Australia
Other introduced diseases such as measles, influenza, typhoid and tuberculosis also resulted in high death rates in Aboriginal communities. Butlin estimates that the Aboriginal population in the area of modern Victoria was around 50,000 in 1788 before two smallpox outbreaks reduced it to about 12,500 in 1830. Between 1835 (the settlement of Port Phillip) and 1853, the Aboriginal population of Victoria fell from 10,000 to around 2,000. It is estimated that about 60 per cent of these deaths were from introduced diseases, 18 per cent from natural causes and 15 per cent from settler violence.
[178]
Venereal diseases were also a factor in Indigenous depopulation, reducing Aboriginal fertility rates in south-eastern Australia by an estimated 40 per cent by 1855. By 1890 up to 50 per cent of the Aboriginal population in some regions of Queensland were affected.
[179]
Conflict and dispossession
Main article:
Australian frontier wars

Australian frontier wars
.
The British settlement was initially planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on agriculture. Karskens argues that conflict broke out between the settlers and the traditional owners of the land because of the settlers' assumptions about the superiority of British civilisation and their entitlement to land which they had "improved" through building and cultivation.
[180]

Van Diemen's Land
around 1828-1830 by
Lieutenant-Governor Arthur
, which explains the precepts of British justice in pictorial form for the
Tasmanian Aboriginals
. Tasmania suffered a higher level of conflict than the other British colonies in Australia.
[181]
Broome argues that the British claims of exclusive possession to land and other property was irreconcilable with Aboriginal concepts of communal ownership of land and its food resources.
[182]
Flood points out that conflict between British law and Aboriginal customary law was also a source of conflict; for example, Aboriginal groups considered they had a right to hunt all animals on their traditional land whereas British settlers considered the killing of their livestock as poaching. Conflict also arose from cross-cultural misunderstandings and from reprisals for previous actions such as the kidnapping of Aboriginal men, women and children. Reprisal attacks and collective punishments were perpetrated by colonists and Aboriginal groups alike.
[183]
Sustained Aboriginal attacks on settlers, the burning of crops and the mass killing of livestock were more obviously acts of resistance to the loss of traditional land and food resources.
[184]
As the colony spread to the more fertile lands around the Hawkesbury river, north-west of Sydney, conflict between the settlers and the
Darug
people intensified, reaching a peak from 1794 to 1810. Bands of Darug people, led by
Pemulwuy
and later by his son
Tedbury
, burned crops, killed livestock and raided settler huts and stores in a pattern of resistance that was to be repeated as the colonial frontier expanded. A military garrison was established on the Hawkesbury in 1795. The death toll from 1794 to 1800 was 26 settlers and up to 200 Darug.
[185]
[186]
Conflict again erupted from 1814 to 1816 with the expansion of the colony into Dharawal country in the Nepean region south-west of Sydney. Following the deaths of several settlers, Governor Macquarie despatched three military detachments into Dharawal lands, culminating in the
Appin massacre
(April 1816) in which at least 14 Aboriginal people were killed.
[187]
[188]
In the 1820s the colony spread to the lightly-wooded pastures west of the
Great Dividing Range
, opening the way for large scale farming and grazing in
Wiradjuri
country.
[99]
From 1822 to 1824
Windradyne
led a group of 50-100 Aboriginal men in raids on livestock and stockmen's huts resulting in the death of 15-20 colonists. Martial law was declared in August 1824 and ended five months later when Windradyne and 260 of his followers ended their armed resistance. Estimates of Aboriginal deaths in the conflict range from 15 to 100.
[189]
[190]
After two decades of sporadic violence between settlers and Aboriginal Tasmanians in Van Diemen's land, the
Black War
broke out in 1824, following a rapid expansion of settler numbers and sheep grazing in the island's interior. When
Eumarrah
, leader of the North Midlands people, was captured in 1828 he said his patriotic duty was to kill as many white people as possible because they had driven his people off their kangaroo hunting grounds. Martial law was declared in the settled districts of Van Diemen's Land in November 1828 and was extended to the entire island in October 1830. A "Black Line" of around 2,200 troops and settlers then swept the island with the intention of driving the Aboriginal population from the settled districts. From 1830 to 1834
George Augustus Robinson
and Aboriginal ambassadors including
Truganini
led a series of "Friendly Missions" to the Aboriginal tribes which effectively ended the Black War.
[191]
Flood states that around 200 settler and 330 Aboriginal Tasmanian deaths in frontier violence were recorded during the period 1803 to 1834, but adds that it will never be known how many Aboriginal deaths went unreported.
[192]
Clements estimates that colonists killed 600 Aboriginal people in eastern Van Diemen's Land during the Black War.
[193]
Around 220 Aboriginal Tasmanians were eventually relocated to Flinders Island.
[194]
Fighting near Creen Creek, Queensland in September 1876
As settlers and pastoralists spread into the region of modern Victoria in the 1830s, competition for land and natural resources again sparked conflict with traditional landowners. Aboriginal resistance was so intense that it was not unusual for sheep runs to be abandoned after repeated attacks. Broome estimates that 80 settlers and 1,000-1,500 Aboriginal people died in frontier conflict in Victoria from 1835 to 1853.
[195]
The growth of the Swan River Colony (centred on Fremantle and Perth) in the 1830s led to conflict with a number of clans of the Noongar people. Governor Sterling established a mounted police force in 1834 and in October that year he led a mixed force of soldiers, mounted police and civilians in a punitive expedition against the Pindjarup. The expedition culminated in the
Pinjarra massacre
in which some 15 to 30 Aboriginal people were killed.
[196]
[197]
According to Neville Green, 30 settlers and 121 Aboriginal people died in violent conflict in Western Australia between 1826 and 1852.
[198]
The
Australian native police
consisted of native troopers under the command of white officers that was largely responsible for the 'dispersal' of Aboriginal tribes in eastern Australia, but particularly in
New South Wales
and
Queensland
The spread of sheep and cattle grazing in grasslands and semi-arid regions of Australia after 1850 brought further conflict with Aboriginal tribes more distant from the closely settled areas. Aboriginal casualty rates in conflicts increased as the colonists made greater use of mounted police,
Native Police
units, and newly developed revolvers and breech-loaded guns. Civilian colonists often launched punitive raids against Aboriginal groups without the knowledge of colonial authorities. Conflict was particularly intense in NSW in the 1840s and in Queensland from 1860 to 1880. In central Australia, it is estimated that 650 to 850 Aboriginal people, out of a population of 4,500, were killed by colonists from 1860 to 1895. In the Gulf Country of northern Australia five settlers and 300 Aboriginal people were killed before 1886.
[199]
The last recorded massacre of Aboriginal people by settlers was at
Coniston
in the Northern Territory in 1928 where at least 31 Aboriginal people were killed.
[200]
The spread of British settlement also led to an increase in inter-tribal Aboriginal conflict as more people were forced off their traditional lands into the territory of other, often hostile, tribes. Butlin estimated that of the 8,000 Aboriginal deaths in Victoria from 1835 to 1855, 200 were from inter-tribal violence.
[201]
Broome estimates the total death toll from settler-Aboriginal conflict between 1788 and 1928 as 1,700 settlers and 17-20,000 Aboriginal people. Reynolds has suggested a higher "guesstimate" of 3,000 settlers and up to 30,000 Aboriginals killed.
[202]
A project team at the University of Newcastle, Australia, has reached a preliminary estimate of 8,270 Aboriginal deaths in frontier massacres from 1788 to 1930.
[203]
Accommodation and protection
In the first two years of settlement the Aboriginal people of Sydney, after initial curiosity, mostly avoided the newcomers. Governor Phillip had a number of Aboriginal people kidnapped in an attempt to learn their language and customs. One of these,
Bennelong
, led the survivors of several clans into Sydney in November 1790, 18 months after the smallpox epidemic that had devastated the Aboriginal population.
[204]

Governor Macquarie hoped to "effect the civilization of the Aborigines" and reclaim them "from their barbarous practices".
[206]
In 1815, he established a Native Institution to provide elementary education to Aboriginal children, settled 15 Aboriginal families on farms in Sydney and made the first freehold land grant to Aboriginal people at Black Town, west of Sydney. In 1816, he initiated an annual Native Feast at Parramatta which attracted Aboriginal people from as far as the Bathurst plains.
[207]
However, by the 1820s the Native Institution and Aboriginal farms had failed. Aboriginal people continued to live on vacant waterfront land and on the fringes of the Sydney settlement, adapting traditional practices to the new semi-urban environment.
[206]
[208]
Escalating frontier conflict in the 1820s and 1830s saw colonial governments develop a number of policies aimed at protecting Aboriginal people. Protectors of Aborigines were appointed in South Australia and the Port Phillip District in 1839, and in Western Australia in 1840. While the aim was to extend the protection of British law to Aboriginal people, more often the result was an increase in their criminalisation. Protectors were also responsible for the distribution of rations, delivering elementary education to Aboriginal children, instruction in Christianity and training in occupations useful to the colonists. However, by 1857 the protection offices had been closed due to their cost and failure to meets their goals.
[209]
[210]

Colonial governments established a small number of reserves and encouraged Christian missions which afforded some protection from frontier violence. In 1825, the NSW governor granted 10,000 acres for an Aboriginal mission at Lake Macquarie.
[211]
In the 1830s and early 1840s there were also missions in the Wellington Valley, Port Phillip and Moreton Bay. The settlement for Aboriginal Tasmanians on Flinders Island operated effectively as a mission under George Robinson from 1835 to 1838.
[212]
In New South Wales, 116 Aboriginal reserves were established between 1860 and 1894. Most reserves allowed Aboriginal people a degree of autonomy and freedom to enter and leave. In contrast, the Victorian Board for the Protection of Aborigines (created in 1869) had extensive power to regulate the employment, education and place of residence of Aboriginal Victorians, and closely managed the five reserves and missions established since self government in 1858. In 1886, the protection board gained the power to exclude "half caste" Aboriginal people from missions and stations. The Victorian legislation was the forerunner of the racial segregation policies of other Australian governments from the 1890s.
[213]
In more densely settled areas, most Aboriginal people who had lost control of their land lived on reserves and missions, or on the fringes of cities and towns. In pastoral districts the British Waste Land Act of 1848 gave traditional landowners limited rights to live, hunt and gather food on Crown land under pastoral leases. Many Aboriginal groups camped on pastoral stations where Aboriginal men were often employed as shepherds and stockmen. These groups were able to retain a connection with their lands and maintain aspects of their traditional culture.
[214]
From autonomy to federation
Colonial self-government and the gold rushes
Main article:
History of Australia (1851-1900)
Towards representative government
Imperial legislation in 1823 had provided for a Legislative Council nominated by the governor of New South Wales, and a new Supreme Court, providing additional limits to the power of governors. A number of prominent colonial figures, including
William Wentworth
. campaigned for a greater degree of self-government, although there were divisions about the extent to which a future legislative body should be popularly elected. Other major issues in the public debate about colonial self-government were traditional British political rights, land policy, transportation and whether colonies with a large population of convicts and former convicts could be trusted with self-government. The
Australian Patriotic Association
was formed in 1835 to promote representative government for New South Wales.
[215]
[216]
The opening of Australia's first elected Parliament in Sydney (
c.
1843
)
The British government abolished transportation to New South Wales in 1840, and in 1842 granted limited representative government to the colony by establishing a reformed Legislative Council with one-third of its members appointed by the governor and two-thirds elected by male voters who met a property qualification. The property qualification meant that only 20 per cent of males were eligible to vote in the first Legislative Council elections in 1843.
[217]
The increasing immigration of free settlers, the declining number of convicts, and the growing middle class and working class population led to further agitation for liberal and democratic reforms. Public meetings in Adelaide in 1844 called for more representative government for South Australia.
[218]
The Constitutional Association, formed in Sydney in 1848, called for manhood suffrage. The
Anti-Transportation League
, founded in Van Diemen's Land in 1849, also demanded more representative government.
[219]
In the Port Phillip District, agitation for representative government was closely linked to demands for independence from New South Wales.
[220]
In 1850, the imperial parliament passed the
Australian Colonies Government Act
,
granting Van Diemen's Land, South Australia and the newly-created colony of Victoria semi-elected Legislative Councils on the New South Wales model. The Act also reduced the property requirement for voting. Government officials were to be responsible to the governor rather than the Legislative Council, so the imperial legislation provided for limited representative government rather than
responsible government
.
[221]
The gold rushes of the 1850s
Mr E.H. Hargraves, The Gold Discoverer of Australia, Feb 12th 1851 returning the salute of the gold miners
- Thomas Tyrwhitt Balcombe
Although gold had been found in Australia as early as 1823 by surveyor James McBrien, a gold rush began when
Edward Hargraves
widely publicised his discovery of gold near
Bathurst, New South Wales
, in February 1851. Further discoveries were made later that year in Victoria, where the richest gold fields were found. By British law all minerals belonged to the Crown, and the governors of New South Wales and Victoria quickly introduced laws aimed at avoiding the disorder associated with the
California gold rush
of 1848. Both colonies introduced a gold mining licence with a monthly fee, the revenue being used to offset the cost of providing infrastructure, administration and policing of the gold fields. As the size of allowable claims was small (6.1 metres square), and much of the gold was near the surface, the licensing system favoured small prospectors over large enterprises.
[222]
The gold rush initially caused some economic disruption including wage and price inflation and labour shortages as male workers moved to the goldfields. In 1852, the male population of South Australia fell by three per cent and that of Tasmania by 17 per cent. Immigrants from the United Kingdom, continental Europe, the United States and China also poured into Victoria and New South Wales. The Australian population increased from 430,000 in 1851 to 1,170,000 in 1861. Victoria became the most populous colony and Melbourne the largest city.
[223]
[224]
Chinese migration was a particular concern for colonial officials. There were 20,000 Chinese miners on the Victorian goldfields by 1855 and 13,000 on the New South Wales diggings. There was a widespread belief that they represented a danger to white Australian living standards and morality, and colonial governments responded by imposing a range of taxes, charges and restrictions on Chinese migrants and residents. Anti-Chinese riots erupted on the Victorian goldfields in 1856 and in New South Wales in 1860.
[225]
According to Stuart Macintyre, "The goldfields were the migrant reception centres of the nineteenth century, the crucibles of nationalism and xenophobia[.]"
[226]
The Eureka stockade
Main article:
Eureka Rebellion
Eureka Stockade
Riot. J. B. Henderson (1854) watercolour
As more men moved to the gold fields and the quantity of easily-accessible gold diminished, the average income of miners fell. Victorian miners increasingly saw the flat monthly licence fee as a regressive tax and complained of official corruption, heavy-handed administration and the lack of voting rights for itinerant miners. Protests intensified in October 1854 when three miners were arrested following a riot at Ballarat. Protesters formed the
Ballarat Reform League
to support the arrested men and demanded manhood suffrage, reform of the mining licence and administration, and land reform to promote small farms. Further protests followed and protesters built a
stockade on the Eureka Field
at Ballarat. On 3 December troops overran the stockade, killing about 20 protesters. Five troops were killed and 12 seriously wounded.
[227]
Following a Royal Commission, the monthly licence was replaced with an annual miner's right at a lower cost which also gave holders the right to vote and build a dwelling on the gold fields. The administration of the Victorian goldfields was also reformed. Stuart Macintyre states, "The Eureka rebellion was a formative event in the national mythology, the Southern Cross [on the
Eureka flag
] a symbol of freedom and independence."
[228]
However, according to A. G. L. Shaw, the Eureka affair "is often painted as a great fight for Australian liberty and the rights of the working man, but it was not that. Its leaders were themselves small capitalists...and even after universal suffrage was introduced...only about a fifth of the miners bothered to vote."
[229]
Self-government and democracy
Main article:
Suffrage in Australia
A polling booth in Melbourne - David Syme and Co (c.1880)
Elections for the semi-representative Legislative Councils, held in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Van Diemen's Land in 1851, produced a greater number of liberal members. That year, the New South Wales Legislative Council petitioned the British Government requesting self-government for the colony. The Anti-Transportation League also saw the convict system as a barrier to the achievement of self-government. In 1852, the British Government announced that convict transportation to Van Diemen's Land would cease and invited the eastern colonies to draft constitutions enabling responsible self-government. The Secretary of State cited the social and economic transformation of the colonies following the discoveries of gold as one of the factors making self-government feasible.
[230]
The constitutions for New South Wales, Victoria and Van Diemen's Land (renamed Tasmania in 1856) gained Royal Assent in 1855, that for South Australia in 1856. The constitutions varied, but each created a lower house elected on a broad male franchise and an upper house which was either appointed for life (New South Wales) or elected on a more restricted property franchise. Britain retained its right of veto over legislation regarding matters of imperial interest. When Queensland became a separate colony in 1859 it immediately became self-governing, adopting the constitution of New South Wales. Western Australia was granted self-government in 1890.
[231]
The secret ballot, adopted in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia in 1856, followed by New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1859) and Western Australia (1877). South Australia introduced universal male suffrage for its lower house in 1856, followed by Victoria in 1857, New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1872), Western Australia (1893) and Tasmania (1900). Queensland excluded Aboriginal males from voting in 1885 (all women were also excluded).
[232]
In Western Australia, where all women were disenfranchised, a property qualification for voting existed for male Aboriginals, Asians, Africans and people of mixed descent.
[231]
Societies to promote women's suffrage were formed in Victoria in 1884, South Australia in 1888 and New South Wales in 1891. The Women's Christian Temperance Union also established branches in most Australian colonies in the 1880s, promoting votes for women and a range of social causes.
[233]
Female suffrage, and the right to stand for office, was first won in South Australia in 1895.
[234]
Women won the vote in Western Australia in 1900, with some restrictions based on race.
[235]
Women in the remainder of Australia only won full rights to vote and to stand for elected office in the decade after Federation, although there were some racial restrictions.
[236]
The long boom (1860 to 1890)
Land reform
In the 1860s New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia introduced Selection Acts intended to promote family farms and mixed farming and grazing. Legislation typically allowed individual "selectors" to select small parcels of unused crown land or leased pastoral land for purchase on credit.
[237]
The reforms initially had little impact on the concentration of land ownership as large landowners used loopholes in the laws to buy more land. However, refinements to the legislation, improvements in farming technology and the introduction of crops adapted to Australian conditions eventually led to the diversification of rural land use. The expansion of the railways from the 1860s allowed wheat to be cheaply transported in bulk, stimulating the development of a wheat belt from South Australia to Queensland.
[238]
Land under cultivation increased from 200,000 hectares to 2 million hectares from 1850 to 1890.
[239]
Bushrangers
William Strutt
's
Bushrangers on the
St Kilda Road
(1887), scene of frequent hold-ups during the
Victorian gold rush
by bushrangers known as the
St Kilda Road robberies
.
The period 1850 to 1880 saw a revival in
bushranging
. The first bushrangers had been escaped convicts or former convicts in the early years of British settlement who lived independently in the
bush
, often supporting themselves by criminal activity. The early association of the bush with freedom was the beginning of an enduring myth. The resurgence of bushranging from the 1850s drew on the grievances of the rural poor (several members of the
Kelly gang
, the most famous bushrangers, were the sons of impoverished small farmers). The exploits of Ned Kelly and his gang garnered considerable local community support and extensive national press coverage at the time. After Kelly's capture and execution for murder in 1880 his story inspired numerous works of art, literature and popular culture and continuing debate about the extent to which he was a rebel fighting social injustice and oppressive police, or a murderous criminal.
[240]
Economic growth and race
From the 1850s to 1871 gold was Australia's largest export and allowed the colony to import a range of consumer and capital goods. More importantly, the increase in population in the decades following the gold rush stimulated demand for housing, consumer goods, services and urban infrastructure.
[241]
By the 1880s half the Australian population lived in towns, making Australia more urbanised than the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.
[242]
Between 1870 and 1890 average income per person in Australia was more than 50 per cent higher than that of the United States, giving Australia one of the highest living standards in the world.
[243]
The size of the government sector almost doubled from 10 per cent of national expenditure in 1850 to 19 per cent in 1890. Colonial governments spent heavily on infrastructure such as railways, ports, telegraph, schools and urban services. Much of the money for this infrastructure was borrowed on the London financial markets, but land-rich governments also sold land to finance expenditure and keep taxes low.
[244]
[245]
In 1856, building workers in Sydney and Melbourne were the first in the world to win the eight hour working day. The 1880s saw trade unions grow and spread to lower skilled workers and also across colonial boundaries. By 1890 about 20 per cent of male workers belonged to a union, one of the highest rates in the world.
[246]
[247]
Economic growth was accompanied by expansion into northern Australia. Gold was discovered in northern Queensland in the 1860s and 1870s, and in the
Kimberley
and
Pilbara
regions of Western Australia in the 1880s. Sheep and cattle runs spread to northern Queensland and on to the
Gulf Country
of the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia in the 1870s and 1880s. Sugar plantations also expanded in northern Queensland during the same period.
[248]
[249]
The gold discoveries in northern Australia attracted a new wave of Chinese immigrants. The Queensland sugar cane industry also relied heavily on indentured South Sea Island workers, whose low wages and poor working conditions became a national controversy and led to government regulation of the industry. Additionally, a significant population of Japanese, Filipinos and Malays were working in pearling and fishing.  In 1890, the population of northern Australia is estimated at about 70,000 Europeans and 20,000 Asians and Pacific Islanders. Indigenous people probably outnumbered these groups, leaving white people a minority north of the Tropic of Capricorn.
[249]
From the late 1870s trade unions, Anti-Chinese Leagues and other community groups campaigned against Chinese immigration and low-wage Chinese labour. Following intercolonial conferences on the issue in 1880-81 and 1888, colonial governments responded with a series of laws which progressively restricted Chinese immigration and citizenship rights.
[250]
1890s depression
Further information:
Australian banking crisis of 1893
"The labor crisis. - The riot in George Street, Sydney"
(c.1890)
Falling wool prices and the collapse of a speculative property bubble in Melbourne heralded the end of the long boom. When British banks cut back lending to Australia, the heavily indebted Australian economy fell into economic depression. A number of major banks suspended business and the economy contracted by 20 per cent from 1891 to 1895. Unemployment rose to almost a third of the workforce. The depression was followed by the "
Federation Drought
" from 1895 to 1903.
[251]
In 1890, a strike in the shipping industry spread to wharves, railways, mines and shearing sheds. Employers responded by locking out workers and employing non-union labour, and colonial governments intervened with police and troops. The strike failed, as did subsequent strikes of shearers in 1891 and 1894, and miners in 1892 and 1896. By 1896, the depression and employer resistance to trade unions saw union membership fall to only about five per cent of the workforce.
[252]
The defeat of the 1890
Maritime Strike
led trade unions to form political parties. In New South Wales, the
Labor Electoral League
won a quarter of seats in the elections of 1891 and held the balance of power between the
Free Trade Party
and the
Protectionist Party
. Labor parties also won seats in the South Australian and Queensland elections of 1893. The world's first Labor government was formed in Queensland in 1899, but it lasted only a week.
[253]
From the mid-1890s colonial governments, often with Labor support, passed acts regulating wages, working conditions and "coloured" labour in a number of industries.
[254]
At an Intercolonial Conference in 1896, the colonies agreed to extend restrictions on Chinese immigration to "all coloured races". Labor supported the Reid government of New South Wales in passing the
Coloured Races Restriction and Regulation Act
, a forerunner of the White Australia Policy. However, after Britain and Japan voiced objections to the legislation, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia instead introduced European language tests to restrict "undesirable" immigrants.
[255]
Growth of nationalism
Main article:
Federation of Australia
The origins of a distinctly Australian style of painting are often associated with the
Heidelberg School
movement,
Tom Roberts
'
Shearing the Rams
(1890) being an iconic example.
By the late 1880s, a majority of people living in the Australian colonies were native born, although more than 90 per cent were of British and Irish heritage.
[256]
The
Australian Natives Association
, a friendly society open to Australian-born males, flourished in the 1880s. It campaigned for an Australian federation within the British Empire, promoted Australian literature and history, and successfully lobbied for the 26 January to be Australia's national day.
[257]
The
bush balladeer
Banjo Paterson
penned a number of classic works including "
Waltzing Matilda
" (1895), regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.
Australian nationalists often claimed that unification of the colonies was Australia's destiny. Australians lived on a single continent, and the vast majority shared a British heritage and spoke English. Many nationalists spoke of Australians sharing common blood as members of the British "race".
[258]
Henry Parkes
stated in 1890, "The crimson thread of kinship runs through us all...we must unite as one great Australian people."
[259]
A minority of nationalists saw a distinctive Australian identity rather than shared "Britishness" as the basis for a unified Australia. Some, such as the radical magazine
The Bulletin
and the Tasmanian Attorney-General
Andrew Inglis Clark
, were republicans, while others were prepared to accept a fully independent country of Australia with only a ceremonial role for the British monarch. In 1887, poet
Henry Lawson
wrote of a choice between "The Old Dead Tree and the Young Tree Green/ The Land that belongs to the lord and the Queen,/And the land that belongs to you."
[260]
A unified Australia was usually associated with a white Australia. In 1887,
The Bulletin
declared that all white men who left the religious and class divisions of the old world behind were Australians.
[261]
The 1880s and 1890s saw a proliferation of books and articles depicting Australia as a sparsely populated white nation threatened by populous Asian neighbours.
[262]
A white Australia also meant the exclusion of cheap Asian labour, an idea strongly promoted by the labour movement.
[263]
According to historian John Hirst, "Federation was not needed to make the White Australia policy, but that policy was the most popular expression of the national ideal that inspired federation."
[264]
The growing nationalist sentiment in the 1880s and 1890s was associated with the development of a distinctively Australian art and literature. Artists of the
Heidelberg School
such as
Arthur Streeton
,
Frederick McCubbin
and
Tom Roberts
followed the example of the European Impressionists by painting in the open air. They applied themselves to capturing the light and colour of the Australian landscape and exploring the distinctive and the universal in the "mixed life of the city and the characteristic life of the station and the bush".
[265]
In the 1890s Henry Lawson,
Banjo Paterson
and other writers associated with
The Bulletin
produced poetry and prose exploring the nature of bush life and themes of independence, stoicism, masculine labour, egalitarianism, anti-authoritarianism and mateship. Protagonists were often shearers, boundary riders and itinerant bush workers. In the following decade Lawson, Paterson and other writers such as
Steele Rudd
, Miles Franklin, and Joseph Furphy helped forge a distinctive national literature. Paterson's ballad "
The Man from Snowy River"
(1890) achieved popularity, and his lyrics to the song "
Waltzing Matilda
" (c. 1895) helped make it the unofficial national anthem for many Australians. According to Macintyre, however, even in the 1890s the "bush legend was just that, a myth that enshrined lost possibilities[.]"
[266]
Federation movement
Main article:
Federation of Australia
Growing nationalist sentiment coincided with business concerns about the economic inefficiency of customs barriers between the colonies, the duplication of services by colonial governments and the lack of a single national market for goods and services.
[267]
Colonial concerns about German and French ambitions in the region also led to British pressure for a federated Australian defence force and a unified, single-gauge railway network for defence purposes.
[268]
A
Federal Council of Australasia
was formed in 1885 but it had few powers and New South Wales and South Australia declined to join.
[269]
Sir Henry Parkes delivering the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, 1 March 1890
An obstacle to federation was the fear of the smaller colonies that they would be dominated by New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland, in particular, although generally favouring a white Australia policy, wished to maintain an exception for South Sea Islander workers in the sugar cane industry.
[270]
Another major barrier was the free trade policies of New South Wales which conflicted with the
protectionist
policies dominant in Victoria and most of the other colonies. Nevertheless, the NSW premier
Henry Parkes
was a strong advocate of
federation
and his
Tenterfield Oration
in 1889 was pivotal in gathering support for the cause. Parkes also struck a deal with
Edmund Barton
, leader of the NSW Protectionist Party, whereby they would work together for federation and leave the question of a protective tariff for a future Australian government to decide.
[271]
In 1890, representatives of the six colonies and New Zealand met in Melbourne and agreed in principle to a federation of the colonies and for the colonial legislatures to nominate representatives to attend a constitutional convention. The following year, the National Australasian Convention was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft constitutional Bill was adopted and transmitted to the colonial parliaments for approval by the people. The worsening economic depression and parliamentary opposition, however, delayed progress.
[272]
In early 1893 the first citizens' Federation League was established in the Riverina region of New South Wales and many other leagues were soon formed in the colonies. The leagues organised a conference in
Corowa
in July 1893 which developed a new plan for federation involving a constitutional convention with directly elected delegates and a referendum in each colony to endorse the proposed constitution. The new NSW premier,
George Reid
, endorsed the "Corowa plan" and in 1895 convinced the majority of other premiers to adopt it.
[273]
Most of the colonies sent directly elected representatives to the constitutional convention, although those of Western Australia were chosen by its parliament. Queensland did not send delegates. The convention held sessions in 1897 and 1898 which resulted in a proposed constitution for a Commonwealth of federated states under the British Crown.
[274]
Referendums held in 1898 resulted in solid majorities for the constitution in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. However, the referendum failed to gain the required majority in New South Wales after that colony's Labor Party campaigned against it and premier Reid gave it such qualified support that he earned the nickname "yes-no Reid".
[275]
The premiers of the other colonies agreed to a number of concessions to New South Wales (particularly that the future Commonwealth capital would be located in that state), and in 1899 further referendums were held in all the colonies except Western Australia. All resulted in yes votes.
[276]
In March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, including Barton and the Victorian parliamentarian
Alfred Deakin
, who had been a leading advocate for federation. Following intense negotiations with the British government, the federation Bill was passed by the imperial government on 5 July 1900 and gained Royal Assent on 9 July. Western Australia subsequently voted to join the new federation.

was proclaimed by the

Lord Hopetoun
on 1 January 1901, and Barton was sworn in as Australia's first prime minister.
[277]
The first
Federal elections
were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow plurality for the Protectionist Party over the Free Trade Party with the
Australian Labor Party
(ALP) polling third. Labor declared it would support the party which offered concessions to its program, and Barton's Protectionists formed a government, with Deakin as
Attorney-General
.
[278]
The
Immigration Restriction Act 1901
was one of the first laws passed by the new
Australian parliament
. This centrepiece of the White Australia policy aimed to extend the restrictions on the immigration of Asians that had previously been enacted by the colonies. Like the colonial legislation, the Immigration Restriction Act used a dictation test in a European language to exclude Asian migrants, who were considered a threat to Australia's living standards and majority British culture. The government also ended the use of indentured South Sea Islander labour in the Queensland sugar cane industry and announced that the workers would be repatriated to their islands by 1906.
[279]
[280]
Deakin stated that White Australia, "is not a surface, but a reasoned policy which goes to the roots of national life, and by which the whole of our social, industrial and political organisation is governed."
[281]
In 1902, the government introduced female suffrage in the Commonwealth jurisdiction, but at the same time excluded Aboriginal people from the franchise unless they already had the vote in a state jurisdiction.
[282]
Opening of the first
Parliament of Australia
in 1901
Implementing the
White Australia policy
was one of the first acts of the new parliament. Pictured: The
Melbourne Punch
(c. May 1888)
The Barton government also introduced a tariff on imports designed to raise revenue and protect Australian industry. However, the tariff was lower and less extensive than many protectionists wanted due to the need to attract sufficient support from Labor parliamentarians, who had a free vote on the issue and many of whom favoured free trade.
[283]
The three major parties all supported a system of Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration to settle industrial disputes extending across state borders, but Labor insisted that railway workers should be included in the system and preference be given to unionised labour. Disagreements about the legislation were instrumental in the fall of Deakin's Protectionist government in April 1904 and the appointment of the first national Labor government under prime minister
Chris Watson
. The Watson government itself fell in April and a Free Trade government under prime minister Reid successfully introduced legislation for a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court.
[284]
In July 1905 Deakin withdrew his support for the Reid government and again formed a Protectionist government with the support of Labor. The new government embarked on a series of social reforms and a program dubbed "new protection" under which tariff protection for Australian industries would be linked to their provision of "fair and reasonable" wages. In the
Harvester case
of 1907,
H. B. Higgins
of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court set a fair and reasonable wage based on the needs of a male breadwinner supporting a wife and three children. In 1908, the
High Court of Australia
struck down the New Protection legislation as unconstitutional.  However, the Harvester case set a standard for a basic wage which was subsequently used by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court when settling industrial disputes. By 1914 the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia used arbitration courts to settle industrial disputes and fix wages and conditions, while Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania used wage boards to achieve the same goals.
[285]
[286]
Labor and anti-Labor
The base of the Labor Party was the
Australian Trade Union movement
which grew from under 100,000 members in 1901 to more than half a million in 1914.
[287]
The party also drew considerable support from clerical workers, Catholics and small farmers.
[288]
In 1905, the Labor party adopted objectives at the federal level which included the "cultivation of an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity" and "the collective ownership of monopolies". In the same year, the Queensland branch of the party adopted an overtly socialist objective.
[289]
Procession in support of an eight-hour work day,
George Street, Sydney
, 4 October 1909
In 1906, the federal Free Trade Party changed its name to the Anti-Socialist party and in the December 1906 elections became the largest party with 38 per cent of the vote (compared with 37 per cent for Labor and 21 per cent for the Protectionists). Deakin's Protectionist government remained in power, but following the passage of legislation for old age pensions and a new protective tariff in 1908, Labor withdrew its support for the government and in November
Andrew Fisher
became the second Labor prime minister. In response, the Liberal-Protectionists, Anti-Socialists and conservative "Corner" group entered into a coalition known as the Fusion which formed a government under prime minister Deakin in June 1909. Reid stated that the question was whether Australia should follow a course of free enterprise or state control.
[290]
In the
elections of May 1910
, Labor won a majority in both houses of parliament and Fisher again became prime minister. The Labor government introduced a series of reforms including a progressive land tax (1910), invalid pensions (1910) and a maternity allowance (1912). The government established the Commonwealth Bank (1911) but referendums to nationalise monopolies and extend Commonwealth trade and commerce powers were defeated in 1911 and 1913. The Commonwealth took over responsibility for the
Northern Territory
from South Australia in 1911.
[291]
[292]
The anti-Labor parliamentary fusion was formalised as the
Commonwealth Liberal Party
under the former New South Wales Labor Party leader
Joseph Cook
. The Liberal Party narrowly won the
May 1913 elections
but Labor still controlled the Senate. The Cook government's attempt to pass legislation abolishing preferential treatment for union members in the Commonwealth Public Service triggered a
double dissolution
of parliament. Labor comfortably won the
September 1914 elections
and Fisher resumed office.
[293]
External affairs and defence
With Federation, the Commonwealth inherited the small defence forces of the six former Australian colonies. By 1901, units of soldiers from all six Australian colonies had been active as part of British forces in
the Boer War
. When the British government asked for more troops from Australia in early 1902, the Australian government obliged with a national contingent. Some 16,500 men had volunteered for service by the war's end in June 1902.
[294]
[295]
In 1884, Britain and Germany had agreed to partition the eastern half of New Guinea.
[296]
In 1902,
British New Guinea
was placed under the authority of Australia which saw the territory as vital for the protection of shipping lanes. With the passage of the Papua Act of 1905, British New Guinea became the Australian
Territory of Papua
. Formal Australian administration of the territory began in 1906.
[297]
Under a 1902 agreement, Australia contributed to the cost of a Royal Navy Pacific fleet to provide for the nation's defence, but Britain reserved the right to deploy the fleet outside Australian waters. Following Japan's defeat of Russia in the 1904-05 war, concern about Japanese naval power led to calls for an Australian fleet. Deakin proposed the purchase of destroyers in 1906 and his government's Surplus Revenue Act of 1908 provided £250,000 for naval expenditure.
[298]
[299]
The Fisher Labor government increased the naval budget and in 1911 established the Royal Australian Navy.
[300]
In October 1913, the navy's first battle cruiser,
Australia
, arrived in Sydney harbour, accompanied by the new light cruisers
Sydney
and
Melbourne
.
[301]
In 1907, Deakin proposed compulsory military training for home defence, a measure that was supported by Watson and Hughes of the Labor party. The Labor party adopted the measure at its 1908 annual conference and in 1911 the Fisher government expanded the system of compulsory military training which had been introduced by the Deakin government the previous year. Defence expenditure increased from £1 million in 1908-09 to £4.3 million in 1913-14, when it accounted for a third of the Commonwealth budget.
[302]
[303]
Economy and population
The breaking of the Federation Drought in 1903 heralded a period of strong economic growth. The economy grew by 75 per cent in the fourteen years to the outbreak of the First World War, with pastoralism, construction, manufacturing and government services leading the way. Rural industries were still the major employer (accounting for a quarter of all jobs) but manufacturing was fast catching up. While employment grew by 30 per cent during the period, employment in manufacturing increased by almost 70 per cent.
[304]
The Australian population also grew strongly, driven by a fall in infant mortality, increasing adult life expectancy, and a revival in state-subsidised immigration. The population increased from four million in 1901 to five million in 1914. From 1910 to 1914 just under 300,000 migrants arrived, all white, and almost all from Britain.

When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, the declaration automatically involved all of Britain's colonies and dominions.
[306]
The outbreak of war came in the middle of the 1914 federal election campaign during which Labor leader Andrew Fisher promised to defend Britain "to the last man and the last shilling."
[306]
Both major parties offered Britain 20,000 Australian troops. As the
Defence Act 1903
precluded sending conscripts overseas, a new volunteer force, the
Australian Imperial Force
(AIF), was raised to meet this commitment.
[307]
[308]

Will Longstaff
. A depiction of the
Battle of Amiens
in which Australian commanders and forces played a major role in inflicting the "Black day of the German Army".
Public enthusiasm for the war was high, and the initial quota for the AIF was quickly filled. The troops left for Egypt on 1 November 1914, one of the escort ships, HMAS
Sydney
, sinking the German cruiser
Emden
along the way. Meanwhile, in September, a separate Australian expeditionary force had captured German New Guinea.
[309]
After arriving in Egypt, the AIF was incorporated into an
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
(ANZAC) under the British general
William Birdwood
. The Anzacs formed part of the
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force
with the task of opening the
Dardanelles
to allied battleships, threatening
Constantinople
, the capital of the
Ottoman Empire
which had entered the war on the side of the
Central Powers
.
General Sir
John Monash
in 1918
The Anzacs, along with French, British and Indian troops, landed on the
Gallipoli
peninsula on 25 April 1915. The Australian and New Zealand position at Anzac Cove was vulnerable to attack and the troops suffered heavy losses in establishing a narrow beachhead. After it had become clear that the expeditionary force would be unable to achieve its objectives in the face of determined Turkish resistance, the Anzacs were evacuated in December, followed by the British and French in early January.
[310]
[311]
The Australians suffered about 8,000 deaths in the campaign.
[312]
Australian war correspondents variously emphasised the bravery and fighting qualities of the Australians and the errors of their British commanders. By 1916,  Australian servicemen were commemorating 25 April, and the date soon became an Australian national holiday known as
Anzac Day
, centring on themes of "nationhood, brotherhood and sacrifice".
[313]
[314]
In 1916, five infantry divisions of the AIF were sent to the Western Front. In July 1916, at
Fromelles
, in a diversionary attack during the
Battle of the Somme
, the AIF suffered 5,533 casualties in 24 hours, the most costly single encounter in Australian military history.
[315]
Elsewhere on the Somme, 23,000 Australians were killed or wounded in seven weeks of attacks on German positions. In Spring 1917, as the Germans retreated to the
Hindenburg Line
, pursuing Australian troops engaged them at the
First Battle of Bullecourt
and the
Second Battle of Bullecourt
, suffering 10,000 casualties. In the summer and autumn of 1917, Australian troops also sustained heavy losses during the British offensive around
Ypres
. Overall, almost 22,000 Australian troops were killed in 1917.
[316]
In November 1917 the five Australian divisions were united in the
Australian Corps
, and in May 1918 the Australian general
John Monash
took over command. The Australian Corps was heavily involved in halting the
German Spring Offensive
of 1918 and in the allied
counter-offensive
of August that year. Constituting about one tenth of the British and dominion soldiers on the Western Front, the Australian Corps was responsible for more than 20 per cent of the territory reconquered, prisoners captured and field guns taken in the counter offensive.
[317]
In the Middle East, the
Australian Light Horse
brigades were prominent in halting the Ottoman and German threat to the Suez Canal at
Romani
in August 1916. In 1917, they participated in the allied advance through the
Sinai Peninsula
and into
Palestine
. This included a light horse mounted charge at Beersheba in October which helped win the
Third Battle of Gaza
. In 1918, they pressed on through Palestine and into Syria in an advance that led to the Ottoman surrender on 31 October.
[318]
By the time the war ended on 11 November 1918, 324,000 Australians had served overseas. Casualties included 60,000 dead and 150,000 wounded—the highest casualty rate of any allied force. Australian troops also had higher rates of unauthorised absence, crime and imprisonment than other allied forces.
[319]
The home front
Few Australians publicly opposed the war in 1914, and volunteers for the AIF outstripped the capacity to enlist and train them.
[320]
[321]
There was also a surge in female participation in voluntary organisations such as the Red Cross and patriotic groups such as the One Woman, One Recruit League.
[322]
Anti-German leagues were formed and 7,000 Germans and other "enemy aliens" were sent to internment camps during the war.
[323]
[324]
Prime Minister W. M. Hughes in 1919
In October 1914, the Fisher Labor government introduced the
War Precautions Act
which gave it the power to make regulations "for securing the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth".
[325]
After
Billy Hughes
replaced Fisher as prime minister in October 1915, regulations under the act were increasingly used to censor publications, penalise public speech and suppress organisations that the government considered detrimental to the war effort.
[324]
[326]
Business uncertainty, the enlistment of young male workers, and the disruption of shipping and export markets led to a decline in economic output. The economy contracted by 10 per cent during the course of hostilities. Inflation rose in the first two years of war and real wages fell.
[327]
[328]
Soon after becoming prime minister, Hughes abandoned a promised referendum to give the Commonwealth the power to control prices, although the government later used its wartime powers to regulate the prices of some basic goods. Lower wages and perceptions of profiteering by some businesses led, in 1916, to a wave of strikes by miners, waterside workers and shearers.
[329]
Enlistments also declined, falling from 35,000 a month at its peak in 1915 to 6,000 a month in 1916.
[330]
Hughes returned from a trip to England and the Western Front in July 1916 and narrowly won a Cabinet vote to hold a referendum on conscription for overseas service. In September the New South Wales Labor Party expelled Hughes on account of the issue. Following the narrow defeat of the
October 1916 conscription referendum
, the state branches of the Labor party began expelling other prominent pro-conscriptionists. In November, Hughes and 23 of his supporters left the parliamentary party, and in January 1917 they formed a new Nationalist government with the former opposition. The Nationalists comfortably won the
May 1917 elections
and Hughes continued as prime minister.
[331]
Political and industrial unrest intensified in 1917. From August to October there was a major strike of New South Wales railway, transport, waterside and coal workers which was defeated after the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments arrested strike leaders and organised special constables and non-union labour. The
Industrial Workers of the World
(IWW) was declared an unlawful organisation and more than 100 of its members were arrested. In September, protests by the
Women's Peace Army
in Melbourne resulted in extensive damage to shops and offices.
[332]
Following further falls in enlistments in 1917, Hughes announced a
second referendum on conscription
to be held in December. The referendum campaign proved divisive, with Hughes denouncing opponents of the measure as "the Germans of Australia, the
Sinn Féin
and the IWW."  The Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne,
Daniel Mannix
, and the Labor premier of Queensland
T. J. Ryan
were prominent campaigners against conscription. The referendum was defeated by a wider margin than in 1916. An April 1918 recruiting conference including representatives of the Commonwealth government, State governments, employers and labour leaders also failed to reach agreement on measures to increase troop numbers.
[333]
Enlistments in 1918 were the lowest for the war, leading to the disbandment of 12 battalions and mutinies in the AIF.
[334]
Paris peace conference
Hughes attended the Imperial War Conference and Imperial War Cabinet in London from June 1918 where Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa won British support for their separate representation at the eventual peace conference.
[335]
[336]
At the
Paris Peace Conference
in 1919, Hughes argued that Germany should pay the full cost of the war, but ultimately gained only £5 million in war reparations for Australia. Australia and the other self-governing British dominions won the right to become full members of the new
League of Nations
, and Australia obtained a special League of Nations mandate over German New Guinea allowing Australia to control trade and immigration. Australia also gained a 42 per cent share of the formerly German-ruled island of Nauru, giving access to its rich superphosphate reserves. Australia argued successfully against a Japanese proposal for a racial equality clause in the League of Nations covenant, as Hughes feared that it would jeopardise the White Australia policy.
[337]
As a signatory to the
Treaty of Versailles
and a full member of the League of Nations, Australia took an important step towards international recognition as a sovereign nation.

, formed from the old
Liberal party
and breakaway elements of Labor (of which he was the most prominent), after the deep and bitter split over
Conscription
. An estimated 12,000 Australians died as a result of the
Spanish flu pandemic
of 1919, almost certainly brought home by returning soldiers.

The success of the
Bolshevik Revolution
in Russia posed a threat in the eyes of many Australians, although to a small group of socialists it was an inspiration. The
Communist Party of Australia
was formed in 1920 and, though remaining electorally insignificant, it obtained some influence in the trade union movement and was banned during World War II for its support for the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
and the
Menzies Government
unsuccessfully tried to ban it again during the
Korean War
. Despite splits, the party remained active until its dissolution at the end of the
Cold War
.
[340]
[341]
The Country Party (today's
National Party
) formed in 1920 to promulgate its version of
agrarianism
, which it called "
Countrymindedness
". The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers, and secure subsidies for them.
[342]
Enduring longer than any other major party save the Labor party, it has generally operated in
Coalition
with the
Liberal Party
(since the 1940s), becoming a major party of government in Australia—particularly in Queensland.
Other significant after-effects of the war included ongoing industrial unrest, which included the
1923 Victorian Police strike
.
[343]
Industrial disputes characterised the 1920s in Australia. Other major strikes occurred on the waterfront, in the coalmining and timber industries in the late 1920s. The union movement had established the
Australian Council of Trade Unions
(ACTU) in 1927 in response to the Nationalist government's efforts to change working conditions and reduce the power of the unions.
The consumerism, entertainment culture, and new technologies that characterised the 1920s in the United States were also found in Australia.
Prohibition
was not implemented in Australia, though anti-alcohol forces were successful in having hotels closed after 6 pm, and closed altogether in a few city suburbs.
[344]
The fledgling
film industry
declined through the decade, despite more than 2 million Australians attending cinemas weekly at 1250 venues. A
Royal Commission
in 1927 failed to assist and the industry that had begun so brightly with the release of the world's first feature film,
The Story of the Kelly Gang
(1906), atrophied until its
revival in the 1970s
.
[345]
[346]
Stanley Bruce
became Prime Minister in 1923, when members of the Nationalist Party Government voted to remove W.M. Hughes. Speaking in early 1925, Bruce summed up the priorities and optimism of many Australians, saying that "men, money and markets accurately defined the essential requirements of Australia" and that he was seeking such from Britain.
[347]
The migration campaign of the 1920s, operated by the Development and Migration Commission, brought almost 300,000 Britons to Australia,
[348]
although schemes to settle migrants and
returned soldiers
"on the land" were generally not a success. "The new irrigation areas in Western Australia and the Dawson Valley of
Queensland
proved disastrous"
[349]
In Australia, the costs of major investment had traditionally been met by state and Federal governments and heavy borrowing from overseas was made by the governments in the 1920s. A
Loan Council
was set up in 1928 to co-ordinate loans, three-quarters of which came from overseas.
[350]
Despite
Imperial Preference
, a balance of trade was not successfully achieved with Britain. "In the five years from 1924. .. to ... 1928, Australia bought 43.4% of its imports from Britain and sold 38.7% of its exports. Wheat and wool made up more than two-thirds of all Australian exports", a dangerous reliance on just two export commodities.
[351]
Australia embraced the new technologies of transport and communication. Coastal sailing ships were finally abandoned in favour of steam, and improvements in rail and motor transport heralded dramatic changes in work and leisure. In 1918, there were 50,000 cars and lorries in the whole of Australia. By 1929 there were 500,000.
[352]
The stage coach company
Cobb and Co
, established in 1853, finally closed in 1924.

Australia achieved independent Sovereign Nation status after World War I, under the
Statute of Westminster
. This formalised the
Balfour Declaration of 1926
, a report resulting from the
1926 Imperial Conference
of
British Empire
leaders in London, which defined
Dominions
of the British empire in the following way: "They are autonomous Communities within the
British Empire
, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to
the Crown
, and freely associated as members of the
British Commonwealth
of Nations."; however, Australia did not ratify the
Statute of Westminster
until 1942.
[357]
According to historian
Frank Crowley
, this was because Australians had little interest in redefining their relationship with Britain until the crisis of World War II.
[358]
The
Australia Act 1986
removed any remaining links between the
British Parliament
and the Australian states.
From 1 February 1927 until 12 June 1931, the Northern Territory was divided up as
North Australia
and
Central Australia
at
latitude 20°S
. New South Wales has had one further territory surrendered, namely
Jervis Bay Territory
comprising 6,677 hectares, in 1915. The external territories were added:
Norfolk Island
(1914);
Ashmore Island
,
Cartier Islands
(1931); the
Australian Antarctic Territory
transferred from Britain (1933);
Heard Island
,
McDonald Islands
, and
Macquarie Island
transferred to Australia from Britain (1947).
The
Federal Capital Territory
(FCT) was formed from New South Wales in 1911 to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of
Canberra
(
Melbourne
was the seat of government from 1901 to 1927). The FCT was renamed the
Australian Capital Territory
(ACT) in 1938. The
Northern Territory
was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth in 1911.
Great Depression
Main article:
Great Depression in Australia

Sydney Harbour Bridge

cuts the ribbon while Governor
Philip Game
looks on.
Australia was deeply affected by the
Great Depression
of the 1930s, particularly due to its heavy dependence on exports, especially primary products such as
wool
and wheat.
[359]
Exposed by continuous borrowing to fund capital works in the 1920s, the Australian and state governments were "already far from secure in 1927, when most economic indicators took a turn for the worse. Australia's dependence of exports left her extraordinarily vulnerable to world market fluctuations", according to economic historian Geoff Spenceley.
[360]
Debt by the state of
New South Wales
accounted for almost half of Australia's accumulated debt by December 1927. The situation caused alarm amongst a few politicians and economists, notably
Edward Shann
of the
University of Western Australia
, but most political, union and business leaders were reluctant to admit to serious problems.
[361]
In 1926,
Australian Finance
magazine described loans as occurring with a "disconcerting frequency" unrivalled in the British Empire: "It may be a loan to pay off maturing loans or a loan to pay the interest on existing loans, or a loan to repay temporary loans from the bankers..."
[362]
Thus, well before the
Wall Street Crash of 1929
, the
Australian economy
was already facing significant difficulties. As the economy slowed in 1927, so did manufacturing and the country slipped into recession as profits slumped and unemployment rose.
[363]
In 1931, more than 1,000 unemployed men marched from the Esplanade to the Treasury Building in
Perth, Western Australia
, to see
Premier
Sir James Mitchell
.
At elections held in October 1929, the
Labor Party
was swept into power in a
landslide victory
;
Stanley Bruce
, the former Prime Minister, lost his own seat. The new Prime Minister,
James Scullin
, and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control of the banking system and divisions within their party about how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales
Premier Lang
, others to Prime Minister Scullin.
Various "plans" to resolve the crisis were suggested;
Sir Otto Niemeyer
, a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer
Ted Theodore
proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor
Premier of New South Wales
,
Jack Lang
, proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.
[364]
The "Premier's Plan" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.
[365]
In March 1931, Lang announced that interest due in London would not be paid and the Federal government stepped in to meet the debt. In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the
Sydney Harbour Bridge
in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the
Governor of New South Wales
,
Philip Game
, had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury. Game judged it was illegal. Lang refused to withdraw his order and, on 13 May, he was
dismissed by Governor Game
. At June elections, Lang Labor's seats collapsed.
[366]
May 1931 had seen the creation of a new conservative political force, the
United Australia Party
formed by breakaway members of the
Labor Party
combining with the
Nationalist Party
. At Federal elections in December 1931, the
United Australia Party
, led by former Labor member
Joseph Lyons
, easily won office. They remained in power until September 1940. The Lyons government has often been credited with steering recovery from the depression, although just how much of this was owed to their policies remains contentious.
[367]
Stuart Macintyre
also points out that although Australian GDP grew from £386.9 million to £485.9 million between 1931 and 1932 and 1938-39, real domestic product per head of population was still "but a few shillings greater in 1938-39 (£70.12), than it had been in 1920-21 (£70.04)."
[368]

Australia recovered relatively quickly from the financial downturn of 1929-1930, with recovery beginning around 1932. The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author
Anne Henderson
of the
Sydney Institute
, Lyons held a steadfast belief in "the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence" and the Lyons period gave Australia "stability and eventual growth" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy—a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture. Lyons saw restoration of Australia's exports as the key to economic recovery.
[369]
Phar Lap
, c. 1930
The extent of unemployment in Australia, often cited as peaking at 29 per cent in 1932 is debated. "Trade union figures are the most often quoted, but the people who were there...regard the figures as wildly understating the extent of unemployment" wrote historian
Wendy Lowenstein
in her collection of oral histories of the depression; however, David Potts argued that "over the last thirty years ...historians of the period have either uncritically accepted that figure (29% in the peak year 1932) including rounding it up to 'a third', or they have passionately argued that a third is far too low."
[370]
[371]
Potts himself though suggested a peak national figure of 25 per cent unemployed.
[372]
Measurement is difficult in part because there was great variation, geographically, by age and by gender, in the level of unemployment. Statistics collected by historian Peter Spearritt show 17.8 per cent of men and 7.9 per cent of women unemployed in 1933 in the comfortable Sydney suburb of
Woollahra
. (This is not to say that 81.9 per cent of women were working but that 7.9 per cent of the women interested/looking for work were unable to find it, a much lower figure than maybe first thought, as many women stayed home and were not in the job force in those years, especially if they were unable to find work.)
In the working class suburb of
Paddington
, 41.3 per cent of men and 20.7 per cent of women were listed as unemployed.
[373]
Geoffrey Spenceley stated that apart from variation between men and women, unemployment was also much higher in some industries, such as the building and construction industry, and comparatively low in the public administrative and professional sectors.
[374]
In country areas, worst hit were small farmers in the wheat belts as far afield as north-east
Victoria
and
Western Australia
, who saw more and more of their income absorbed by interest payments.
[375]
Extraordinary sporting successes did something to alleviate the spirits of Australians during the economic downturn. In a
Sheffield Shield
cricket match at the
Sydney Cricket Ground
in 1930,
Don Bradman
, a young New South Welshman of just 21 years of age wrote his name into the record books by smashing the previous highest batting score in first-class cricket with 452 runs not out in just 415 minutes.
[376]
The rising star's world beating cricketing exploits were to provide Australians with much needed joy through the emerging
Great Depression in Australia
and post-World War II recovery. Between 1929 and 1931 the racehorse
Phar Lap
dominated Australia's racing industry, at one stage winning fourteen races in a row.
[377]
Famous victories included the 1930
Melbourne Cup
, following an assassination attempt and carrying 9 stone 12 pounds weight.
[378]
Phar Lap sailed for the United States in 1931, going on to win North America's richest race, the
Agua Caliente Handicap
in 1932. Soon after, on the cusp of US success, Phar Lap developed suspicious symptoms and died. Theories swirled that the champion race horse had been poisoned and a devoted Australian public went into shock.
[379]
The
1938 British Empire Games
were held in Sydney from 5-12 February, timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).
Indigenous policy
Following federation Aboriginal affairs was a state responsibility, although the Commonwealth became responsible for the Aboriginal population of the Northern Territory from 1911. By that date the Commonwealth and all states except Tasmania had passed legislation establishing Protectors of Aborigines and Protection Boards with extensive powers to regulate the lives of Aboriginal Australians including their ownership of property, place of residence, employment, sexual relationships and custody of their children. Reserves were established, ostensibly for the protection of the Aboriginal population who had been dispossessed of their land. Church groups also ran missions throughout Australia providing shelter, food, religious instruction and elementary schooling for Indigenous people.
[380]
Some officials were concerned by the growing number of Aboriginal children of mixed heritage, particularly in northern Australia where large Indigenous, South Sea Islander and Asian populations were seen as inconsistent with the white Australia policy. Laws concerning Aboriginal Australians were progressively tightened to make it easier for officials to remove Aboriginal children of mixed descent from their parents and place them in reserves, missions, institutions and employment with white employers.
[381]
The segregation of Aboriginal people on reserves and in institutions was never systematically accomplished due to funding constraints, differing policy priorities in the states and territories, and resistance from Aboriginal people. In the more densely settled areas of Australia, about 20 per cent of Aboriginal people lived on reserves in the 1920s. The majority lived in camps on the fringes of country towns and a small percentage lived in cities. During the Great Depression more Aboriginal people moved to reserves and missions for food and shelter. By 1941 almost half of the Aboriginal population of New South Wales lived on reserves.
[382]
In northern Australia, the majority of employed Aboriginal people worked in the pastoral industry where they lived in camps, often with their extended families. Many also camped on the margins of towns and reserves where they could avoid most of the controls imposed by the administrators of reserves, compounds and missions.
[383]
The 1937 Native Welfare conference of state and Commonwealth officials endorsed a policy of biological absorption of mixed-descent Aboriginal Australians into the white community.
[T]he destiny of the natives of aboriginal origin, but not of the full blood, lies in their ultimate absorption by the people of the Commonwealth and it therefore recommends that all efforts be directed to that end.
[384]
The officials saw the policy of Aboriginal assimilation by absorption into the white community as progressive, aimed at eventually achieving civil and economic equality for mixed-descent Aboriginal people.
[384]
"... efforts of all State authorities should be directed towards the education of children of mixed aboriginal blood at white standards, and their subsequent employment under the same conditions as whites with a view to their taking their place in the white community on an equal footing with the whites."
[385]
The following decades saw an increase in the number of Aboriginal Australians of mixed descent removed from their families, although the states and territories progressively adopted a policy of cultural, rather than biological, assimilation, and justified removals on the grounds of child welfare.
[386]
In 1940, New South Wales became the first state to introduce a child welfare model whereby Aboriginal children of mixed descent were removed from their families under general welfare provisions by court order. Other jurisdictions introduced a welfare model after the war.

Defence policy in the 1930s
Prime Minister
Robert Menzies
and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
in 1941
Until the late 1930s, defence was not a significant issue for Australians. At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion about how the defence spending should be allocated. The
United Australia Party
government emphasised co-operation with Britain in "a policy of imperial defence". The lynchpin of this was the British naval base at
Singapore
and the
Royal Navy
battle fleet "which, it was hoped, would use it in time of need".
[387]
Defence spending in the inter-war years reflected this priority. In the period 1921-1936 totalled £40 million on the
Royal Australian Navy
, £20 million on the
Australian Army
and £6 million on the
Royal Australian Air Force
(established in 1921, the "youngest" of the three services). In 1939, the Navy, which included two heavy cruisers and four light cruisers, was the service best equipped for war.
[388]

Fearing Japanese intentions in the Pacific, Menzies established independent embassies in Tokyo and Washington to receive independent advice about developments.
[389]
Gavin Long
argues that the
Labor
opposition urged greater national self-reliance through a buildup of manufacturing and more emphasis on the Army and
RAAF
, as Chief of the General Staff,
John Lavarack
also advocated.
[390]
In November 1936, Labor leader
John Curtin
said "The dependence of Australia upon the competence, let alone the readiness, of British statesmen to send forces to our aid is too dangerous a hazard upon which to found Australia's defence policy."
[391]
According to John Robertson, "some British leaders had also realised that their country could not fight Japan and Germany at the same time." But "this was never discussed candidly at...meeting(s) of Australian and British defence planners", such as the
1937 Imperial Conference
.
[392]
By September 1939 the Australian Army numbered 3,000 regulars.
[393]
A recruiting campaign in late 1938, led by Major-General
Thomas Blamey
increased the reserve militia to almost 80,000.
[394]
The first division raised for war was designated the 6th Division, of the 2nd AIF, there being 5 Militia Divisions on paper and a 1st AIF in the First World War.

On 3 September 1939, the Prime Minister,
Robert Menzies
, made a national radio broadcast: "My fellow Australians. It is my melancholy duty to inform you, officially, that, in consequence of the persistence by Germany in her
invasion of Poland
, Great Britain has declared war upon her, and that, as a result, Australia is also at war."
[396]
Thus began Australia's involvement in the six-year global conflict. Australians were to fight in an extraordinary variety of locations, including withstanding the advance of German
Panzers
in the
Siege of Tobruk
, turning back the advance of the
Imperial Japanese Army
in the
New Guinea Campaign
, undertaking bomber missions over Europe, engaging in naval battles in the Mediterranean. At home, Japanese attacks included mini-submarine raids on Sydney Harbour and very heavy air raids on and near the Northern Territory's capital,
Darwin
.
[397]
The recruitment of a volunteer military force for service at home and abroad was announced, the
2nd Australian Imperial Force
and a citizen militia organised for local defence. Troubled by Britain's failure to increase defences at Singapore, Menzies was cautious in committing troops to Europe. By the end of June 1940, France, Norway, Denmark and the Low Countries had fallen to
Nazi Germany
. Britain stood alone with its
dominions
. Menzies called for "all-out war", increasing federal powers and introducing conscription. Menzies' minority government came to rely on just two independents after the
1940 election
.
[398]
In January 1941, Menzies flew to Britain to discuss the weakness of Singapore's defences. Arriving in London during
The Blitz
, Menzies was invited into
Winston Churchill
's
British War Cabinet
for the duration of his visit. Returning to Australia, with the threat of Japan imminent and with the Australian army suffering badly in the
Greek
and
Crete
campaigns, Menzies re-approached the Labor Party to form a War Cabinet. Unable to secure their support, and with an unworkable parliamentary majority, Menzies resigned as prime minister. The Coalition held office for another month, before the independents switched allegiance and
John Curtin
was sworn in as prime minister.

From 1940 to 1941, Australian forces played prominent roles in the fighting in the
Mediterranean theatre
, including
Operation Compass
, the
Siege of Tobruk
, the
Greek campaign
, the
Battle of Crete
, the
Syria-Lebanon Campaign
and the
Second Battle of El Alamein
.
A garrison of around 14,000 Australian soldiers, commanded by Lieutenant General
Leslie Morshead
was besieged in
Tobruk, Libya
, by the German-Italian army of General
Erwin Rommel
between April and August 1941. The Nazi propagandist
Lord Haw Haw
derided the defenders as 'rats', a term the soldiers adopted as an ironic compliment: "
The Rats of Tobruk
".
[399]
Vital in the defence of Egypt and the
Suez Canal
, the siege saw the advance of the German army halted for the first time and provided a morale boost for the
British Commonwealth
, which was then standing alone against Hitler.

With most of Australia's best forces committed to fight against Hitler in the Middle East, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US naval base in Hawaii, on 8 December 1941 (eastern Australia time). The British battleship
HMS
Prince of Wales
and battlecruiser
HMS
Repulse
sent to defend Singapore were sunk soon afterwards. Australia was ill-prepared for an attack, lacking armaments, modern fighter aircraft, heavy bombers, and aircraft carriers. While demanding reinforcements from Churchill, on 27 December 1941 Curtin published an historic announcement:
[400]
"The Australian Government... regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say in the direction of the democracies' fighting plan. Without inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom."

in 1943. 22,000 Australians were captured by the Japanese; 8,000 died as POWs.
Two battle-hardened Australian divisions were already steaming from the Middle East for Singapore. Churchill wanted them diverted to Burma, but Curtin refused, and anxiously awaited their return to Australia. US President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
ordered his commander in the Philippines, General
Douglas MacArthur
, to formulate a Pacific defence plan with Australia in March 1942. Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of General MacArthur, who became "Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific". Curtin had thus presided over a fundamental shift in Australia's foreign policy. MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia. In late May 1942, Japanese
midget submarines
sank an
accommodation vessel
in a daring raid on
Sydney Harbour
. On 8 June 1942, two Japanese submarines briefly shelled Sydney's eastern suburbs and the city of Newcastle.
[402]
In an effort to isolate Australia, the Japanese planned a seaborne invasion of
Port Moresby
, in the Australian
Territory of New Guinea
. In May 1942, the
US Navy
engaged the Japanese in the
Battle of the Coral Sea
and halted the attack. The
Battle of Midway
in June effectively defeated the Japanese navy and the Japanese army launched a land assault on Moresby from the north.
[158]
Between July and November 1942, Australian forces repulsed Japanese attempts on the city by way of the
Kokoda Track
, in the highlands of
New Guinea
. The
Battle of Milne Bay
in August 1942 was the first Allied defeat of Japanese land forces.

Meanwhile, in North Africa, the
Axis Powers
had driven Allies back into
Egypt
. A turning point came between July and November 1942, when
Australia's 9th Division
played a crucial role in some of the heaviest fighting of the
First
and
Second Battle of El Alamein
, which turned the
North Africa Campaign
in favour of the Allies.
[403]
The
Battle of Buna-Gona
, between November 1942 and January 1943, set the tone for the bitter final stages of the
New Guinea campaign
, which persisted into 1945. The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943-44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces.
[404]
On 14 May 1943, the
Australian Hospital Ship
Centaur
, though clearly marked as a medical vessel, was sunk by Japanese raiders off the Queensland coast, killing 268, including all but one of the nursing staff, further enraging popular opinion against Japan.
[405]
[406]
Australian prisoners of war
were at this time suffering severe ill-treatment in the Pacific Theatre. In 1943, 2,815 Australian Pows died constructing Japan's
Burma-Thailand Railway
[407]
In 1944, the Japanese inflicted the
Sandakan Death March
on 2,000 Australian and British prisoners of war—only 6 survived. This was the single worst war crime perpetrated against Australians in war.
[408]
MacArthur largely excluded Australian forces from the main push north into the Philippines and Japan. It was left to Australia to lead
amphibious assaults
against Japanese bases in
Borneo
. Curtin suffered from ill health from the strains of office and died weeks before the war ended, replaced by
Ben Chifley
.
Of Australia's wartime population of seven million, almost one million men and women served in a branch of the services during the six years of warfare. By war's end, gross enlistments totalled 727,200 men and women in the
Australian Army
(of whom 557,800 served overseas), 216,900 in the RAAF and 48,900 in the RAN. More than 39,700 were killed or died as prisoners of war, about 8,000 of whom died as prisoners of the Japanese.

Japanese air raids on Australia
during 1942-43 killed hundreds of servicemen and civilians, while
Axis naval activity in Australian waters

While the Australian civilian population suffered less at the hands of the Axis powers than did other Allied nations in Asia and Europe, Australia nevertheless came under direct attack by Japanese naval forces and aerial bombardments, particularly through 1942 and 1943, resulting in hundreds of fatalities and fuelling fear of Japanese invasion.
Axis naval activity in Australian waters
also brought the war close to home for Australians. Austerity measures, rationing and labour controls measures were all implemented to assist the war effort.
[410]
Australian civilians dug air raid shelters, trained in civil defence and first aid, and Australian ports and cities were equipped with anti aircraft and sea defences.
[411]
The Australian economy was markedly affected by World War II.
[412]
Expenditure on war reached 37 per cent of GDP by 1943-44, compared to 4 per cent expenditure in 1939-1940.
[413]
Total war expenditure was £2,949 million between 1939 and 1945.

Although the peak of army enlistments occurred in June-July 1940, when more than 70,000 enlisted, it was the
Curtin Labor government
, formed in October 1941, that was largely responsible for "a complete revision of the whole Australian economic, domestic and industrial life".
[415]
Rationing of fuel, clothing and some food was introduced, (although less severely than in Britain) Christmas holidays curtailed, "brown outs" introduced and some public transport reduced. From December 1941, the Government evacuated all women and children from Darwin and northern Australia, and more than 10,000 refugees arrived from South East Asia as Japan advanced.
[416]
In January 1942, the Manpower Directorate was set up "to ensure the organisation of Australians in the best possible way to meet all defence requirements."
[415]
Minister for War Organisation of Industry,
John Dedman
introduced a degree of austerity and government control previously unknown, to such an extent that he was nicknamed "the man who killed Father Christmas".
In May 1942 uniform tax laws were introduced in Australia, ending state governments' control of income taxation. "The significance of this decision was greater than any other... made throughout the war, as it added extensive powers to the Federal Government and greatly reduced the financial autonomy of the states."
[417]
Manufacturing grew significantly because of the war. "In 1939, there were only three Australian firms producing machine tools, but by 1943 there were more than one hundred doing so."
[418]
From having few front line aircraft in 1939, the RAAF had become the fourth largest allied Air force by 1945. A number of aircraft were built under licence in Australia before the war's end, notably the
Beaufort
and
Beaufighter
, although the majority of aircraft were from Britain and later, the US.
[419]
The
Boomerang fighter
, designed and built in four months of 1942, emphasised the desperate state Australia found itself in as the Japanese advanced.
Australia also created, virtually from nothing, a significant female workforce engaged in direct war production. Between 1939 and 1944 the number of women working in factories rose from 171,000 to 286,000.

Post-war boom
Main article:
History of Australia since 1945
Menzies and Liberal dominance: 1949-72
Sir Robert Menzies
, founder of the
Liberal Party of Australia
and
Prime Minister of Australia
1939-41 (
UAP
) and 1949-66
Politically,
Robert Menzies
and the
Liberal Party of Australia
dominated much of the immediate post war era, defeating the Labor government of
Ben Chifley
in 1949, in part because of a Labor proposal to nationalise banks
[421]
and following a crippling coal strike led by the
Australian Communist Party
. Menzies became the country's longest-serving Prime Minister and the Liberal party, in
coalition
with the rural based
Country Party
, won every federal election until 1972.
As in the United States in the early 1950s, allegations of communist influence in society saw tensions emerge in politics. Refugees from Soviet dominated Eastern Europe immigrated to Australia, while to Australia's north,
Mao Zedong
's
Chinese Communist Party
won the
Chinese Civil War
in 1949 and in June 1950, Communist
North Korea
invaded
South Korea
. The Menzies government responded to a United States led
United Nations Security Council
request for military aid for South Korea and diverted forces from
occupied Japan
to begin Australia's involvement in the
Korean War
. After fighting to a bitter standstill, the UN and North Korea signed a ceasefire agreement in July 1953. Australian forces had participated in such major battles as
Kapyong
and
Maryang San
. 17,000 Australians had served and casualties amounted to more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed.
[422]

During the course of the
Korean War
, the Liberal government attempted to ban the
Communist Party of Australia
, first by legislation in 1950 and later by referendum, in 1951.
[423]
While both attempts were unsuccessful, further international events such as the defection of minor Soviet Embassy official
Vladimir Petrov
, added to a sense of impending threat that politically favoured Menzies' Liberal-CP government, as the Labor Party split over concerns about the influence of the Communist Party on the trade union movement. The tensions led to another
bitter split
and the emergence of the breakaway
Democratic Labor Party
(DLP). The DLP remained an influential political force, often holding the balance of power in the Senate, until 1974. Its preferences supported the Liberal and Country Party.
[424]
The Labor party was led by
H.V. Evatt
after Chifley's death in 1951. Evatt had served as
President of the United Nations General Assembly
during 1948-49 and helped draft the
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(1948). Evatt retired in 1960 amid signs of mental ill-health, and
Arthur Calwell
succeeded him as leader, with a young
Gough Whitlam
as his deputy.
[425]
Menzies presided during a period of sustained economic boom and the beginnings of sweeping social change, which included
youth culture
and its
rock and roll music
and, in the late 1950s, the arrival of television broadcasting. In 1958,
Australian country music
singer
Slim Dusty
, who would become the musical embodiment of rural Australia, had Australia's first international music chart hit with his
bush ballad
"
Pub With No Beer
",
[426]
while
rock and roller
Johnny O'Keefe
's "
Wild One
" became the first local recording to reach the national charts, peaking at No. 20.
[427]
[428]
Australian cinema
produced little of its own content in the 1950s, but British and Hollywood studios produced a string of successful epics from
Australian literature
, featuring home grown stars
Chips Rafferty
and
Peter Finch
.
Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the
monarchy
and
Commonwealth of Nations
and formalised an
alliance with the United States
, but also launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner.
[429]
When Menzies retired in 1965, he was replaced as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by
Harold Holt
. Holt drowned while swimming at a surf beach in December 1967 and was replaced by
John Gorton
(1968-1971) and then by
William McMahon
(1971-1972).
Post-war immigration
Main articles:
Post-war immigration to Australia
and
History of immigration to Australia
Postwar migrants arriving in Australia in 1954
After World War II and by the 1950s, Australia had a population of 10 million, and the most populous urban centre was its oldest city,
Sydney
. It has retained its status as Australia's largest city ever since.
Following World War II, the
Chifley
Labor government instigated a massive programme of European immigration. In 1945, Minister for Immigration,
Arthur Calwell
wrote "If the experience of the Pacific War has taught us one thing, it surely is that seven million Australians cannot hold three million square miles of this earth's surface indefinitely."
[430]
All political parties shared the view that the country must "populate or perish". Calwell stated a preference for ten British immigrants for each one from other countries; however, the numbers of British migrants fell short of what was expected, despite government assistance.
[431]
Migration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time. A 1958 government leaflet assured readers that unskilled non-British migrants were needed for "labour on rugged projects ... work which is not generally acceptable to Australians or British workers".
[432]
The Australian economy stood in sharp contrast to war-ravaged Europe, and newly arrived migrants found employment in a booming manufacturing industry and government assisted programmes such as the
Snowy Mountains Scheme
. This
hydroelectricity
and
irrigation
complex in south-east Australia consisted of sixteen major dams and seven power stations constructed between 1949 and 1974. It remains the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia. Necessitating the employment of 100,000 people from
more than 30 countries
, to many it denoted the birth of multicultural Australia.
[433]
Some 4.2 million immigrants arrived between 1945 and 1985, about 40 per cent of whom came from Britain and Ireland.
[434]
The 1957 novel
They're a Weird Mob
was a popular account of an Italian migrating to Australia, although written by Australian-born author
John O'Grady
. The Australian population reached 10 million in 1959-with Sydney its most populous city.
In May 1958, the
Menzies
Government passed the
Migration Act 1958
which replaced the Immigration Restriction Act's arbitrarily applied dictation test with an entry permit system, that reflected economic and skills criteria.
[435]
[436]
Further changes in the 1960s effectively ended the
White Australia Policy
. It legally ended in 1973.
Economic growth and suburban living
Tumut 3
power station was constructed as part of the vast
Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme
(1949-1974). Construction necessitated the expansion of Australia's immigration programme.
Australia enjoyed significant growth in prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s, with increases in both living standards and in leisure time.
[437]
[438]
The manufacturing industry, previously playing a minor part in an economy dominated by primary production, greatly expanded. The first
Holden
motor car came out of General Motors-Holden's Fisherman's Bend factory in November 1948. Car ownership rapidly increased—from 130 owners in every 1,000 in 1949 to 271 owners in every 1,000 by 1961.
[439]
By the early 1960s, four competitors to Holden had set up Australian factories, employing between 80,000 and 100,000 workers, "at least four-fifths of them migrants".
[440]
In the 1960s, about 60 per cent of Australian manufacturing was protected by tariffs. Pressure from business interests and the union movement ensured these remained high. Historian Geoffrey Bolton suggests that this high tariff protection of the 1960s caused some industries to "lapse into lethargy", neglecting research and development and the search for new markets.
[440]
The
CSIRO
was expected to fulfil research and development.
Prices for wool and wheat remained high, with wool the mainstay of Australia's exports. Sheep numbers grew from 113 million in 1950 to 171 million in 1965. Wool production increased from 518,000 to 819,000 tonnes in the same period.
[441]
Wheat, wool and minerals ensured a healthy balance of trade between 1950 and 1966.
[442]
The great housing boom of the post war period saw rapid growth in the suburbs of the major Australian cities. By the 1966 census, only 14 per cent lived in rural Australia, down from 31 per cent in 1933, and only 8 per cent lived on farms.
[443]
Virtual full employment meant high standards of living and dramatic increases in home ownership, and by the sixties, Australia had the most equitable spread of income in the world.
[444]
By the beginning of the sixties, an Australia-wide McNair survey estimated that 94% of homes had a fridge, 50% a telephone, 55% a television, 60% a washing machine, and 73% a vacuum cleaner. In addition, most households had now acquired a car.
[445]
According to one study, "In 1946, there was one car for every 14 Australians; by 1960, it was one to 3.5. The vast majority of families had access to a car."
[437]
Car ownership flourished during the postwar period, with 1970/1971 census data estimating that 96.4 per cent of Australian households in the early Seventies owned at least one car; however, not all felt the rapid suburban growth was desirable.
[446]
Distinguished Architect and designer
Robin Boyd
, a critic of Australia's built surroundings, described Australia as "'the constant sponge lying in the Pacific', following the fashions of overseas and lacking confidence in home-produced, original ideas".
[447]
In 1956,
dadaist
comedian
Barry Humphries
performed the character of
Edna Everage
as a parody of a house-proud housewife of staid 1950s Melbourne suburbia (the character only later morphed into a critique of self-obsessed celebrity culture). It was the first of many of his satirical stage and screen creations based around quirky Australian characters:
Sandy Stone
, a morose elderly suburbanite,
Barry McKenzie
a naive Australian expat in London and
Sir Les Patterson
, a vulgar parody of a Whitlam-era politician.
[448]
Some writers defended suburban life. Journalist Craig Macgregor saw suburban life as a "...solution to the needs of migrants..." Hugh Stretton argued that "plenty of dreary lives are indeed lived in the suburbs... but most of them might well be worse in other surroundings".
[449]
Historian Peter Cuffley has recalled life for a child in a new outer suburb of Melbourne as having a kind of joyous excitement. "Our imaginations saved us from finding life too humdrum, as did the wild freedom of being able to roam far and wide in different kinds of (neighbouring) bushland...Children in the suburbs found space in backyards, streets and lanes, playgrounds and reserves..."
[450]
In 1954, the
Menzies Government
formally announced the introduction of the new two-tiered TV system—a government-funded service run by the
ABC
, and two commercial services in Sydney and
Melbourne
, with the
1956 Summer Olympics
in
Melbourne
being a major driving force behind the introduction of television to Australia.
[451]
Colour TV began broadcasting in 1975.
Indigenous assimilation and child removal
The 1951 Native Welfare Conference of state and Commonwealth officials agreed on a policy of cultural assimilation for all Aboriginal Australians.
Paul Hasluck
, the Commonwealth Minister for Territories, stated: "Assimilation means, in practical terms, that, in the course of time, it is expected that all persons of aboriginal blood or mixed blood in Australia will live like other white Australians do."
[385]
[386]
Controls over the daily lives of Aboriginal people and the removal of Aboriginal children of mixed descent continued under the policy of assimilation, although the control was now largely exercised by Welfare Boards and removals were justified on welfare grounds. The number of Aboriginal people deemed to be wards of the state under Northern Territory welfare laws doubled to 11,000 from 1950 to 1965.
[452]
The policy of assimilation attracted increasing criticism from Aboriginal people and their supporters on the grounds of its negative effects on Aboriginal families and its denial of Aboriginal cultural autonomy. Removals of Aboriginal children of mixed descent from their families slowed by the late 1960s and by 1973 the Commonwealth had adopted a policy of
self-determination
for Indigenous Australians.
[453]
In 1997, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission estimated that between 10 per cent and one-third of Aboriginal children had been removed from their families from 1910 to 1970. Regional studies indicate that 15 per cent of Aboriginal children were removed in New South Wales from 1899 to 1968, while the figure for Victoria was about 10 per cent.
[454]
Robert Manne estimates that the figure for Australia as a whole was closer to 10 per cent.
[455]
Summarising the policy of assimilation and forced removals of Aboriginal children of mixed descent, Richard Broome concludes: "Even though the children's material conditions and Western education may have been improved by removal, even though some removals were necessary, and even though some people were thankful for it in retrospect, overall it was a disaster....It was a rupturing of tens of thousands of Aboriginal families, aimed at eradicating Aboriginality from the nation in the cause of homogeneity and in fear of difference."
[454]
Alliances 1950-1972
Harold Holt
and US President
John F. Kennedy
in the
Oval Office
in Washington D.C., 1963. By the 1960s, Australian defence policy had shifted from Britain to the US as key ally.
In the early 1950s, the Menzies government saw Australia as part of a "triple alliance" in concert with both the US and traditional ally Britain.
[456]
At first, "the Australian leadership opted for a consistently pro-British line in diplomacy", while at the same time looking for opportunities to involve the US in South East Asia.
[457]
Thus, the government committed military forces to the
Korean War
and the
Malayan Emergency
and hosted British
nuclear tests
after 1952.
[458]
Australia was also the only Commonwealth country to offer support to the British during the
Suez Crisis
.
[459]
Menzies oversaw an effusive welcome to Queen
Elizabeth II
on the first visit to Australia by a
reigning monarch
, in 1954. He made the following remarks during a light-hearted speech to an American audience in New York, while on his way to attend her coronation in 1953: "We in Australia, of course, are British, if I may say so, to the boot heels...but we stand together - our people stand together - till the crack of doom."
[460]
As British influence declined in South East Asia, the US alliance came to have greater significance for Australian leaders and the Australian economy. British investment in Australia remained significant until the late 1970s, but trade with Britain declined through the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1950s the Australian Army began to re-equip using US military equipment. In 1962, the US established a naval communications station at
North West Cape
, the first of several built during the next decade.
[461]
[462]
Most significantly, in 1962,
Australian Army advisors
were sent to help train South Vietnamese forces, in a developing conflict in which the British had no part.
According to diplomat
Alan Renouf
, the dominant theme in Australia's foreign policy under Australia's Liberal-Country Party governments of the 1950s and 1960s was anti-communism.
[463]
Another former diplomat, Gregory Clark, suggested that it was specifically a fear of China that drove Australian foreign policy decisions for twenty years.
[464]
The
ANZUS
security treaty, which had been signed in 1951, had its origins in Australia's and New Zealand's fears of a rearmed Japan. Its obligations on the US, Australia and New Zealand are vague, but its influence on Australian foreign policy thinking, at times has been significant.
[465]
The
SEATO
treaty, signed only three years later, clearly demonstrated Australia's position as a US ally in the emerging
Cold War
.
[466]
As Britain struggled to enter the Common Market in the 1960s, Australia saw that its historic ties with the mother country were rapidly fraying. Canberra was alarmed but kept a low profile, not wanting to alienate London. Russel Ward states that the implications of
British entry into Europe in 1973
: "seemed shattering to most Australians, particularly to older people and conservatives."
[467]
Carl Bridge, however, points out that Australia had been "hedging its British bets" for some time. The ANZUS treaty and Australia's decision to enter the Vietnam War did not involve Britain and by 1967 Japan was Australia's leading export partner and the US her largest source of imports. According to Bridge, Australia's decision not to follow Britain's devaluation of her currency in 1967 "marked the demise of British Australia."
[466]
Vietnam War
Main article:
Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War
Personnel and aircraft of

South Vietnam
in August 1964.
By 1965, Australia had increased the size of the
Australian Army Training Team Vietnam
(AATTV), and in April the Government made a sudden announcement that "after close consultation with the United States", a battalion of troops was to be sent to
South Vietnam
.
[468]
In parliament, Menzies emphasised the argument that "our alliances made demands on us". The alliance involved was presumably, the
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
(SEATO), and Australia was providing military assistance because South Vietnam, a signatory to SEATO, had apparently requested it.
[469]
Documents released
in 1971 indicated that the decision to commit troops was made by Australia and the US, not at the request of South Vietnam.
[470]
By 1968, there were three Australian Army battalions at any one time at the
1st Australian Task Force
(1ATF) base at
Nui Dat
in addition to the advisers of the AATTV placed throughout Vietnam, and personnel reached a peak total of almost 8,000, comprising about one third of the Army's combat capacity. Between 1962 and 1972 almost 60,000 personnel served in Vietnam, including ground troops, naval forces and air assets.
[471]
In July 1966, new Prime Minister
Harold Holt
expressed his government's support for the US and its role in Vietnam in particular. "I don't know where people would choose to look for the security of this country were it not for the friendship and strength of the United States."
[472]
While on a visit in the same year to the US, Holt assured President
Lyndon B. Johnson
"...I hope there is corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the fact that you have an admiring friend, a staunch friend, [Australia] that will be all the way with LBJ."
[473]
The Liberal-CP Government was returned with a massive majority in elections held in December 1966, fought over national security issues including Vietnam. The opposition Labor Party had advocated the withdrawal of all conscripts from Vietnam, but its deputy leader
Gough Whitlam
had stated that a Labor government might maintain regular army troops there.
[474]
Arthur Calwell, who had been leader of the Labor Party since 1960, retired in favour of Whitlam a few months later.
Despite Holt's sentiments and his government's electoral success in 1966, the war became unpopular in Australia, as it did in the United States. The movements to end Australia's involvement gathered strength after the
Tet Offensive
of early 1968 and compulsory national service (selected by ballot) became increasingly unpopular. In the
1969 elections
, the government hung on despite a significant decline in popularity.
Moratorium marches
held across Australia in mid-1970 attracted large crowds- the Melbourne march of 100,000 being led by Labor MP
Jim Cairns
. As the Nixon administration proceeded with
Vietnamization
of the war and began the withdrawal of troops, so did the Australian Government. In November 1970
1st Australian Task Force
was reduced to two battalions and in November 1971, 1ATF was withdrawn from Vietnam. The last military advisors of the AATTV were withdrawn by the Whitlam Labor government in mid-December 1972.
[471]
The Australian military presence in Vietnam had lasted 10 years, and in purely human cost, more than 500 had been killed and more than 2,000 wounded. The war cost Australia $218 million between 1962 and 1972.
[471]
Reform and reaction: 1972-1996
The Whitlam government: 1972-75
Gough Whitlam
and US President
Richard Nixon
in 1973. The
Whitlam government
was responsible for significant reforms, but went on to be
dismissed
in controversial circumstances.
Elected in December 1972 after 23 years in opposition,
Labor
won office under
Gough Whitlam
, introducing significant reforms and expanding the Federal budget. Welfare benefits were extended and payment rates increased, a national health insurance scheme was introduced, and divorce laws liberalised. Commonwealth expenditure on schools trebled in the two years to mid-1975 and the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for funding higher education, abolishing tuition fees. In foreign affairs the new government prioritised the Asia Pacific region, formally abolishing the White Australia Policy, recognising Communist China and enhancing ties with Indonesia. Conscription was abolished and the remaining Australian troops in Vietnam withdrawn. The Australian national anthem was changed from God Save the Queen to Advance Australia Fair, the imperial honours system was replaced at the Commonwealth level by the Order of Australia, and Queen Elizabeth II was officially styled Queen of Australia. Relations with the US, however, became strained after government members criticised the resumption of the US bombing campaign in North Vietnam.
[475]
In Indigenous affairs, the government introduced a policy of self-determination for Aboriginal people in economic, social and political affairs.  Federal expenditure on Aboriginal services increased from $23 million to $141 million during the three years of the government.
[476]
One of the first acts of the
Whitlam government
was to establish a
Royal Commission into land rights
in the Northern Territory under Justice Woodward. Legislation based on its findings was passed into law by the
Fraser government
in 1976, as the
Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976
.
[476]
As the Whitlam government did not control the Senate, much of its legislation was rejected or amended. After Labor was re-elected with a reduced majority at
elections in May 1974
, the Senate remained an obstacle to its political agenda. The government's popularity was also harmed by deteriorating economic conditions and a series of political scandals. Increased government spending, rapid wage growth, booming commodity prices and the first OPEC oil shock led to economic instability. The unemployment rate reached post-war high of 3.6 per cent in late 1974 and the annual inflation rate hit 17 per cent.
[477]
In 1974-75 the government began negotiations for US$4 billion in foreign loans to fund state development of Australia's mineral and energy resources. Minister
Rex Connor
conducted secret discussions with a
loan broker from Pakistan
, and the Treasurer,
Jim Cairns
, misled parliament about the issue. Arguing the government was incompetent following the
Loans Affair
, the opposition
Liberal-Country Party Coalition
delayed passage of the government's money bills in the Senate, until the government would promise a new election. Whitlam refused and the deadlock ended when his government was controversially
dismissed by the Governor-General
,
John Kerr
on 11 November 1975. Opposition leader Malcolm Fraser was installed as caretaker Prime Minister, pending an election.
[478]
Fraser government: 1975-83
Malcolm Fraser
and US President
Jimmy Carter
in 1977.
The Federal elections of December 1975 resulted in a landslide victory for the Liberal-Country Party Coalition and Malcolm Fraser continued as Prime Minister. The coalition government won subsequent elections in 1977 and 1980, making Fraser the second longest serving Australian Prime Minister up to that time.
[479]
The Fraser government espoused a policy of administrative competence and economic austerity leavened by progressive humanitarian, social and environmental interventions. The government enacted the Whitlam government's land rights bill with few changes, increased immigration, and resettled Indochinese refugees. It promoted multiculturalism and in 1978 established the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a multicultural broadcaster. In foreign policy, the government continued Labor's friendly relations with China and Indonesia, repaired the frayed relationship with the US and opposed white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia. The government also attempted to use its influence with the US and China to limit Soviet expansionism. Environmental policies included banning resource development on Fraser Island and the Great Barrier Reef, creating Kakadu National Park and banning whaling. However, the government refused to use Commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the
Franklin Dam
in Tasmania in 1982 and the resulting grassroots campaign against the dam contributed to the emergence of an influential
Environmental movement in Australia
,
[480]
[479]
On the economic front, the Fraser government followed a "fight inflation first" strategy centred on budget cuts and wage restraint. Welfare benefits were restricted, the universal healthcare system was partially dismantled, and university funding per student cut. However, by the early 1980s economic conditions were deteriorating. The second oil shock in 1979 increased inflation which was exacerbated by a boom in commodity prices and a sharp increase in real wages. An international recession, the collapse of the resources boom and a severe drought in eastern Australia saw unemployment rise. The government responded with Keynesian deficit spending in its 1982 Budget, but by 1983 both unemployment and annual inflation exceeded 10 per cent. At the Federal elections in March 1983 the coalition government was comfortably defeated by Labor under its popular new leader
Bob Hawke
.
[481]
Labor governments: 1983-1996
Bob Hawke
with
Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev
in 1987. Hawke went on to become the longest-serving Labor Prime Minister.
The
Hawke government
pursued a mixture of free market reforms and consensus politics featuring "summits" of government representatives, business leaders, trade unions and non-government organisations in order to reach consensus on key issues such as economic policy and tax reform. The centrepiece of this policy mix was an Accord with trade unions under which wage demands would be curtailed in return for increased social benefits. Welfare payments were increased and better targeted to those on low incomes, and a retirement benefits scheme (superannuation) was extended to most employees. A new universal health insurance scheme, Medicare, was introduced.
[482]
The Treasurer Paul Keating oversaw a program of deregulation and micro-economic reforms which broke with the
Keynesian economics
that had traditionally been favoured by the Labor party.
[483]
These reforms included floating the Australian dollar, deregulating capital markets and allowing competition from foreign banks. Business regulation and competition policy was streamlined, tariffs and quotas on Australian manufactured goods and rural commodities were gradually reduced, and a number of government enterprises and services were progressively privatised. The higher education system was restructured and significantly expanded, partly funded by the reintroduction of fees in the form of student loans and "contributions"
(HECS)
.
[484]
Paul Kelly concludes that, "In the 1980s both Labor and non-Labor underwent internal philosophical revolutions to support a new set of ideas—faith in markets, deregulation, a reduced role for government, low protection and the creation of a new cooperative enterprise culture."
[485]
The Hawke government courted the growing environmental movement with a series of actions including using Federal powers to stop the Franklin Dam development in Tasmania, banning new uranium mines at Jabiluka, and proposing Kakadu National park for world heritage listing.
[482]
In foreign policy, the Hawke government maintained strong relations with the US and was instrumental in the formation of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group. Australia contributed naval ships and troops to UN forces in the Gulf War after Iraq had invaded Kuwait in 1990.
[482]
[486]
Opening of
the new Parliament House
during the
Australian Bicentenary
, May 1988.
The government complemented its consensus politics with other initiatives aimed at fostering national unity. The
Australia Act 1986
eliminated the last vestiges of British legal authority at the Federal level. The
Australian Bicentenary
in 1988 was the focus of year-long celebrations with multicultural themes. The World Expo 88 was held in Brisbane and a new
Parliament House
in Canberra was opened.
[487]
Strong economic growth, falling unemployment, an unstable opposition, and Bob Hawke's popularity with the public contributed to the re-election of the Hawke government in 1984, 1987 and 1990. However, the economy went into
recession in 1990
and by late 1991 the unemployment rate had risen above 10 per cent. With the government's popularity falling,
Paul Keating
successfully challenged for the leadership and became Prime Minister in December 1991.
[482]
The Keating government's first priority was economic recovery. In February 1992 it released the "One Nation" job creation package and later legislated tax cuts to corporations and individuals to boost economic growth. Unemployment reached 11.4 per cent in 1992—the highest since the
Great Depression in Australia
. The
Liberal-National Opposition
had proposed an
ambitious plan of economic reform
to take to the
1993 Election
, including the introduction of a
Goods and Services Tax
. Keating campaigned strongly against the tax and was returned to office in March 1993.
[488]
Paul Keating
with Indonesian President
Suharto
in 1992.
In May 1994 a more ambitious "Working Nation" jobs program was introduced. The Keating government also pursued a number of "big picture" issues throughout its two terms including increased political and economic engagement in the Asia Pacific region,
Indigenous reconciliation
, an
Australian republic
and "efficiency with equity". The government engaged closely with the Indonesian President,
Suharto
and other regional partners, and successfully campaigned to increase the role of
APEC
as a major forum for strategic and economic co-operation.
[489]
A Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was established and, following the High Court of Australia's historic
Mabo decision
in 1992, the first national
Native Title legislation
was introduced to regulate claims and provide compensation for loss of native title.
[490]
In 1993, Keating established a
Republic Advisory Committee
to examine options for Australia becoming a republic. The government also introduced family payments and a superannuation guarantee with compulsory employer contributions.
[491]
Under the Hawke government the annual migration intake had more than doubled from 54,500 in 1984-85 to more than 120,000 in 1989-90. The Keating government responded to community concerns about the pace of immigration by cutting the immigration intake and introducing mandatory detention for illegal immigrants arriving without a valid visa. Immigration fell to 67,900 in 1992-93.
[492]
[493]
With foreign debt, inflation and unemployment still stubbornly high, and after a series of ministerial resignations, Keating lost the March
1996 Election
to the Liberals'
John Howard
.
[494]
[495]
Australia in a globalised world: 1996 - 2022
Howard government: 1996-2007
John Howard
, the 25th
Prime Minister of Australia
held office from 1996-2007, the second-longest tenure in history
Opening ceremony
of the
2000 Summer Olympics
in Sydney.
John Howard
with a Liberal-National Party coalition served as
Prime Minister
from 1996 until 2007, winning re-election in 1998, 2001 and 2004 to become the second-longest serving prime minister after Menzies. One of the first programs instigated by the
Howard government
was a nationwide
gun control scheme
following a
mass shooting at Port Arthur
. The new government saw industrial relations and taxation as two key areas of economic reform which had been left undone by the Hawke-Keating governments. The coalition introduced
industrial relations reforms in 1996
which promoted individual contracts and enterprise bargaining. In 2006, it controversially introduced the
WorkChoices
legislation, which made it easier for small businesses to terminate employment. After the 1996 election, Howard and treasurer
Peter Costello
proposed a
Goods and Services Tax
(GST) which they successfully took to the electorate in 1998 and implemented in July 2000.
[496]
A political concern for the new government was the significant public support for
Pauline Hanson
and, later, her
One Nation party
, which espoused populist policies including winding back free market reforms, Asian immigration and programs for Indigenous Australians. The government responded with public messaging criticising elites and political correctness and emphasising Australian values.
[497]
[498]
The coalition initially cut immigration intakes, abolished the
Office of Multicultural Affairs
and other multicultural agencies, and introduced citizenship tests for migrants.
[499]
Following a sharp increase in unauthorised arrivals by boat from 1999, the government opened new mandatory detention centres in remote areas of Australia and issued temporary visas for those found to be refugees. Following the
Children Overboard affair
and the
Tampa Affair
in 2001, the government introduced the
Pacific Solution
, which involved detaining unauthorised immigrants in detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea while their refugee status was determined, as well as a policy of turning back vessels intercepted at sea.
[500]
In Indigenous affairs the Prime Minister rejected calls for a treaty with Indigenous Australians and an apology for past actions which had harmed them. Instead, the government pursued a policy of "practical reconciliation" involving specific measures to improve Indigenous education, health, employment and housing. In response to the High Court's decision in
Wik Peoples v Queensland
, in 1996, the Howard government amended native title legislation to limit native title claims. In 2007, following the release of the "
Little Children are Sacred
" report detailing widespread abuse in Aboriginal communities, the Howard government launched the
Northern Territory Intervention
in order to create a safe environment for Indigenous children. The government's response was criticised by the co-chairs of the report, received a divided response from the Indigenous community, but was supported by the Labor opposition.
[501]
Honouring a commitment made during the 1996 election campaign, the Howard government set up a people's convention on an Australian republic. The resulting 1999 referendum on a republic failed. Howard, an avowed monarchist, became the only Australian Prime Minister to publicly oppose a constitutional amendment he had put to the people.
[502]
[503]
The
Australian-led
coalition
INTERFET
during the
East Timor crisis
from 1999-2002
In 1999, Australia led a
United Nations force into East Timor
to help establish democracy and independence for that nation, following political violence. During this period Australia committed to a number of other peacekeeping and stabilisation operations: notably in
Bougainville
, including
Operation Bel Isi
(1998-2003); as well as
Operation Helpem Fren
and the Australian-led
Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands
(RAMSI) in the early 2000s; and the
2006 East Timorese crisis
.
[504]
Following the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US and the subsequent War on Terror, Australia committed troops to the
Afghanistan War
and the
Iraq War
. These events, along with the
2002 Bali Bombings
and other terrorist incidents, led to the creation of a National Security Committee and further anti-terrorist legislation.
[496]
In foreign affairs, the government advocated a policy of  "Asia first, but not Asia only", emphasising traditional links to the Commonwealth and the US. Relations with Indonesia became strained over East Timor but generally improved after the Bali bombings. Australia's support of US policy during the War on Terror was followed by an
Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement
in 2004. Trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand were also secured and relations with China improved. Australia joined the US in refusing to ratify the
Kyoto Protocol
on greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that it would harm Australia's economy and would be ineffective without the participation of China and India.
[505]
After initial cuts, the immigration intake increased from 92,270 in 1999-2000 to 157,000 in 2005-06, with a bias towards skilled workers to meet the needs of a rapidly growing economy. The immigration intake also became increasingly diverse, with the proportion of immigrants from South Asia increasing from 8 per cent in 1996-97 to 20 per cent in 2007-08. Inbound tourism also grew, helped by the Sydney Olympic games in 2000.
[506]
The economy continued its uninterrupted expansion since the early 1990s recession, with record jobs growth and the lowest unemployment rates since the 1970s. Exports and imports grew from a value of about a third of Australia's economic output in the early 1990s to 40 per cent in 2005. China became Australia's second largest trading partner after Japan, and foreign investment in Australia more than doubled. The coalition delivered Budget surpluses in most years which, along with the proceeds of government asset sales - most notably of Telstra - were partly invested in a
Future Fund
to reduce the national debt. Income inequality and private debt increased as the economy expanded, with the biggest increase in incomes accruing to the top 10 per cent of income earners.
[507]
By 2007 the Howard government was consistently trailing the Labor opposition in opinion polls, with key issues being rising interest rates, the unpopular Work Choices industrial relations reforms, and climate change policy. The government was also hampered by leadership tensions between Howard and Costello and opinion polls indicating a desire for a generational change in leadership (opposition leader Kevin Rudd was eighteen years younger than Howard and widely seen as more vibrant). Labor won the
November 2007 election
with a swing of more than 5 per cent and Howard became only the second sitting Prime Minister to lose his seat in an election.
[508]
Labor governments: 2007-2013
Kevin Rudd
and
Julia Gillard
in 2006. Gillard went on to become Australia's first female Prime Minister.
Kevin Rudd became Prime Minister in December 2007 and held office until June 2010, when he was replaced as leader by
Julia Gillard
, Australia's first female Prime Minister. Following the
August 2010 federal election
, Gillard formed a minority Labor government with the support of the
Australian Greens
and three independents. Gillard was replaced as Prime Minister by Rudd in June 2013, and Labor lost the subsequent
September 2013
election.
[509]
[510]
The first
Rudd government
moved quickly to ratify the Kyoto protocols, dismantle the previous government's Work Choices industrial relations reforms, and issue an apology to Aboriginal Australians for past policies, particularly the
removal of Aboriginal children from their families
.
[509]
The government was soon confronted by the
Global Financial Crisis
and subsequent
global recession
, responding with a series of economic stimulus measures worth A$75 billion. Although economic growth slowed in 2008, Australia was one of the few advanced economies in the world to avoid recession.
[511]
Rudd declared climate change "the great moral challenge of our generation" and his government proposed an
emissions trading scheme
(ETS) to address the issue. The necessary legislation, however, was twice rejected in the Senate when the Opposition and Greens refused to support it. After the December 2009
UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen
failed to produce an agreed international response to global warming the government decided to postpone its ETS until 2013, a decision which saw Labor lose some electoral support to the Greens.
[512]
The government also lost some public support when it proposed a
Resources Super Profits Tax
following the release of the
Henry Tax Review
in May 2010. The resulting media campaign against the tax by the mining industry particularly affected Labor's support in the resource-rich states of Queensland and Western Australia.
[513]
Australian special forces wait for extraction during the
War in Afghanistan (2001-2021)
Illegal immigration policy proved another difficult issue for the government, which initially closed the Nauru processing centre, abolished temporary protection visas and took measures to improve the legal rights and processing time for applicants for asylum. However, unauthorised arrivals by boat increased sharply from 2009 and the number in mandatory detention stretched capacity. The new leader of the Opposition,
Tony Abbot
, promised that a Coalition government would "stop the boats."
[514]
[515]
In June 2010, with the government behind the Opposition in polls and Rudd's popularity rating falling, the Labor caucus replaced Rudd with Gillard as leader.
[515]
The new leader was able to negotiate concessions on a new mining tax with large mining companies but failed to reach agreement with East Timor on a proposed migration processing centre there.
[516]
Following the September 2010 election, the Gillard government passed a series of legislation with the support of the Greens who now held the balance of power in the Senate. This included enabling legislation for a
National Broadband Network
, a
carbon pricing scheme
, a mining tax, a
National Disability Insurance Scheme
, and school funding reforms.
[510]
Illegal immigration policy, however, remained a politically sensitive issue. The government negotiated an agreement with Malaysia to process some people there but the plan did not gain the support of the Opposition or the Greens and was struck down by the High Court. As the number of unauthorised immigrants arriving by boat continued to climb, the government reopened offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru.
[517]
In Indigenous affairs, the government introduced, in 2012, a modified policy in the Northern Territory ('Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory') under a 10-year funding agreement. The new policy retained many features of the Northern Territory Intervention but was broader in scope and involved more collaboration with Indigenous stakeholders.
[518]
Following mounting leadership speculation and poor polling for the government, Rudd defeated Gillard in a leadership ballot in June 2013 and returned as Prime Minister, promising to replace the carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme and to ensure that people arriving without authority by boat would not be settled in Australia.
[519]
The Opposition, promising to "stop the boats," abolish the carbon tax and mining tax, and reduce the Budget deficit and government debt, won the September 2013 election.
[520]
Liberal-National Coalition governments: (2013-2022)
The return of the
Liberal-National Coalition
to power after six years in opposition initially failed to restore stability to the office of prime minister. Prime Minister
Tony Abbott
's rival
Malcolm Turnbull
challenged for and won the leadership of the Liberals within Abbott's first term. After Turnbull narrowly returned the Coalition to office in 2016, Party dissatisfaction with his leadership saw him replaced by
Scott Morrison
in 2018.
Abbott government (2013-2015)
Prime Minister
Tony Abbott
signing the
China-Australia Free Trade Agreement
with President
Xi Jinping
, November 2014
Prime Minister
Tony Abbott's Liberal-National Coalition government
began implementing its policies on unauthorised maritime arrivals, including
Operation Sovereign Borders
, boat turnbacks, the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, and the resettlement in third countries of those found to be refugees. The new policy strained relations with Indonesia, but the number of people arriving by boat fell from 20,587 in 2013 to none in 2015.
[521]
[522]
The government continued Australia's economic engagement with Asia, signing trade agreements with
China
,
South Korea
and
Japan
. The government also embraced the
intervention against Islamic State in Iraq
and Syria, joining the air campaign, sending special forces and providing training for the Iraqi army.
[523]
The government made cuts to Indigenous programs, brought the
Indigenous Affairs portfolio
into the
Cabinet
, and established the
Indigenous Advisory Council
.
[524]
[525]
[526]
The government's May 2014 Budget, which included measures such as the deregulation of university fees, welfare cuts and projected cuts to funding to the states for health and education, proved unpopular, with the perception that it had involved breaking a number of election promises.
[527]
The government secured the passage of legislation abolishing the carbon tax (July 2014) and the mining tax (September 2014).
[523]
The Prime Minister announced a number of decisions - most notably the reintroduction of knighthoods and a knighthood for
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh
- which had not been approved by cabinet and which were widely criticised in the media.
[528]
[529]
By September 2015 the government had lost 30
Newspolls
in a row and
Malcolm Turnbull
successfully challenged for the leadership.
[530]
Turnbull government (2015-2018)
Malcolm Turnbull

Trần Đại Quang

and

, November 2017.
The new Turnbull government promised to promote a "smart, agile and innovative Australia" and "jobs and growth".
[531]
The government announced a National Innovation and Science Agenda and delivered a Budget featuring cuts to company tax.
[532]
However, the
elections of July 2016
saw the government returned with a majority on only one and a minority in the Senate, making it more difficult to secure the passage of government legislation. Following a national postal plebiscite, the government legalised
same-sex marriage
in December 2017.
[533]
In foreign affairs, Australia signed a refugee exchange deal with the US in September 2016, allowing those in detention on Manus Island and Nauru to be settled in the US.
[534]
There was increased tension with China because of Australia's criticism of China's policies in the South China Sea, Australia's new laws targeting foreign influence in domestic politics, and a ban, on national security grounds, on Chinese companies supplying Australia's
5G
communications network. Trade with China, however, continued to grow.
[535]
In 2017, the United States, Japan, India and Australia agreed to revive the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue
in order to counter Chinese ambitions in the
South China Sea
.
[536]
Australia signed a modified
Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade agreement with 10 other nations in March 2018 after the US withdrew from the original agreement.
[537]
The government lost five by-elections in July 2018. When, in August, the government sought to introduce legislation for a National Energy Guarantee, including a commitment to meet Australia's
emissions target
under the
Paris Agreement
, a number of Coalition members vowed to vote against the bill. The resulting controversy further harmed the government, which had already lost more than 30 consecutive Newspolls. The parliamentary Liberal Party elected Scott Morrison as its new leader and he was sworn in as Prime Minister.

The
Morrison government
committed to remaining in the Paris Agreement, but promised a greater focus on reduction of energy prices.
[540]
In foreign affairs the government signed the
Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement
(IA-CEPA) in March 2019.
[541]
In April, the treasurer delivered a Budget focusing on tax cuts, increased spending on roads and other infrastructure, and a forecast return to a surplus.
[542]
The government was returned at the elections of May 2019 with a three-seat majority.
In 2017, a constitutional convention of 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander delegates had issued the
Uluru Statement from the Heart
, calling for the recognition of Indigenous sovereignty, a Makarrata (truth telling and agreement-making) Commission, constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians and a "voice to parliament". In 2019, the government announced a process to "develop options for a model that will ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heard at all levels of government".
[543]
Within a year the government was confronted with the international
COVID-19 pandemic
and the subsequent recession, Australia's first in 29 years.
[544]
From 1 February 2020, Australia progressively closed its borders to foreign nationals who had recently visited high-risk countries, culminating, on 20 March, in a general ban on the entry of foreign nationals.
[545]
On 13 March 2020, a
National Cabinet
, including Australian government, state government and territory government leaders, was created to address the crisis.
[546]
The national cabinet announced a series of increasingly tighter restrictions on non-essential business, travel and gatherings of people with the aim of suppressing COVID. These restrictions were progressively eased from early May, although individual states and territories intermittently reimposed restrictions in response to particular outbreaks of COVID-19.
[547]
[548]
The Australian government made provision for $267 billion in economic stimulus measures, and $16.6 billion in health measures in response to COVID-19.
[549]
As a result of the COVID-19 recession, the unemployment rate rose from about 5 per cent in February 2020 to 7.5 per cent in July 2020. As the economy began to recover from the second half of 2020, the unemployment rate fell to 5.6 per cent in March 2021 and hours worked returned to pre-recession levels.
[548]
[550]
As at 17 April 2021, Australia was ranked 134 out of 177 countries in the number of COVID-19 deaths per capita.
[551]
In June 2021 Australia and the United Kingdom announced that they had struck a preliminary deal on a
free-trade agreement
.
[552]
On 16 September 2021, the government announced that Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States had agreed to the creation of an enhanced trilateral security partnership, dubbed
AUKUS
. The first initiative under AUKUS would be for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarine technology. As a result of the agreement, Australia cancelled its 2016 contract for the diesel-electric
Attack
-class submarine
with the French company Naval Group.
[553]
China condemned the AUKUS agreement, stating it "seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race".
[554]
France announced it would withdraw its ambassador from Australia in protest against the lack of consultation on the security agreement and the cancellation of the $90 billion dollar contract for French submarines.
[555]
Post-pandemic: 2022 to present
Albanese government (2022- present)
On 23 May 2022,
Anthony Albanese
was sworn in as Australia's new prime minister. His Labor Party defeated Scott Morrison's conservative government in the
election
. Prime Minister Albanese formed Australia's first Labor government in almost a decade.
[556]
In December 2022, the prime minister announced that a referendum for an Indigenous Voice to parliament would be held before December 2023.
[557]
On 30 January 2023, Albanese unveiled a new national cultural policy 'Revive' with $286 million in funding over four years, labelled the most significant investment in
Australian culture
since the Keating government.
[558]
The Revive policy's centrepiece establishes 'Creative Australia', with four new bodies; a
First Nations
-led body, Music Australia, Writers Australia and the Centre for Arts and Entertainment Workplaces. Revive's legislation also granted protection for First Nations culture as well as funding toward a First Nations languages partnership between First Nations representatives and Australian governments and funding the establishment of a National Aboriginal Art Gallery in
Alice Springs
and an Aboriginal Cultural Centre in
Perth
.
[559]
The policy also provided regulation for a revenue levy for streaming services to reinvest in locally produced
cinema
and
television
productions.
[560]
Revive policy also included the first establishment of a
poet laureate
for Australia.
[561]
Society and culture: 1960s to present
Social developments
Indigenous Australians
In 1960, Aboriginal affairs were still regulated by state governments and, in the Northern Territory, by the Australian government. In most states Aboriginal Australians were banned from drinking alcohol and their freedom of association, movement and control of property was restricted. Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory banned Aboriginal people from voting and Queensland and Western Australia controlled their right to marry. Aboriginals were often subjected to unofficial "colour bars" restricting their access to many goods, services and public facilities, especially in country towns.
[562]
The official policy of the Australian government and most state governments, however, was the assimilation of Aboriginal people into mainstream culture: "all aborigines and part-aborigines are expected to eventually attain the same manner of living as other Australians and to live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians."
[563]
The 1960s was a key decade for Indigenous rights, with the demand for change led by Indigenous activists and organisations such as the
Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders
.
[564]
In 1962, the
Menzies Government
's
Commonwealth Electoral Act
gave Indigenous people the right to vote at federal elections. In 1965, Queensland became the last state to confer state voting rights on Aboriginal people.
[565]
[566]
In 1963, the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land sent a bark petition to the Australian parliament asking for recognition of their traditional land rights. They subsequently took their case to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory which ruled against them in September 1971.
[567]
In 1965,
Charles Perkins
, helped organise
freedom rides
into parts of Australia to expose discrimination and inequality. In 1966, the
Gurindji
people of Wave Hill station commenced the
Gurindji strike
in a quest for equal pay and recognition of land rights.
[568]
In 1966, the Australian government gave Aboriginal people the same rights to social security benefits as other Australians.
[569]
A
1967 referendum
called by the
Holt government
saw Australians vote by a 91 per cent majority to change the
Australian constitution
to include all Aboriginal Australians in the national census and allow the Federal parliament to legislate on their behalf.
[570]
A Council for Aboriginal Affairs was established.
[571]
Demands for Indigenous self-determination and the preservation of cultural identity were increasingly promoted. In January 1972 Aboriginal activists erected an
Aboriginal "tent embassy"
on the lawns of parliament house, Canberra and issued a number demands including land rights, compensation for past loss of land and self-determination. The leader of the opposition Gough Whitlam was among those who visited the tent embassy to discuss their demands.
[572]
The Whitlam government came to power in December 1972 with a policy of self-determination for Aboriginal people.
[476]
The government also passed legislation against racial discrimination and established a
Royal Commission into land rights
in the Northern Territory, which formed the basis for the Fraser government's
Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976
.
[476]
Uluru: returned to traditional owners in 1985
The Land Rights Act only applied to the Northern Territory, but Aboriginal communities could also acquire land through various state land rights acts or other legislation. By the early 1980s Aboriginal communities had gained title to about 30 per cent of Northern Territory land and 20 per cent of South Australian land. In 1982, the Queensland government granted Aboriginal reserve land to its occupiers but the grants gave limited rights and was revocable at any time. Only a small proportion of land in other states had been transferred to traditional owners. In 1985, the Hawke government handed over
Uluru
(Ayers Rock) to traditional owners with a lease back to the Commonwealth. In 1987, the West Australian government granted Aboriginal reserve land (amounting to 7 per cent of the state's land) to traditional owners on 50 year and 99 year leases. Key issues for Indigenous communities with recognised land rights included security of title, the protection of culturally significant sites, and the right to veto, or to be adequately compensated for, mining and development on their land. Compensation for previous dispossession of land was an unresolved issue.
[573]
In 1992, the High Court of Australia handed down its decision in the
Mabo Case
, holding that Indigenous native title survived reception of English law and continued to exist unless extinguished by conflicting law or interests in land. The Keating government passed a Native Title Act in 1993 to regulate native title claims and established a Native Title Tribunal to hear those claims. In the subsequent Wik decision of 1996, the High Court found that a pastoral lease did not necessarily extinguish native title. In response, the Howard government amended the Native Title Act to provide better protection for pastoralists and others with an interest in land.
[574]
By March 2019 the Native Titles Tribunal had determined that 375 Indigenous communities had established native title over 39 per cent of the Australian continent, with one third under exclusive title.
[575]
From 1960 the Indigenous population grew faster than the Australian population as a whole and increasingly lived in urban areas. The Aboriginal population was 106,000 in 1961 (1 per cent of the total population), with 20 per cent living in capital cities compared with 40 per cent for the population as a whole. In 2016, the Indigenous population was 786,900 (3 per cent of the population), with a third living in major cities compared with more than two-thirds of people who were not indigenous. While most of this growth was due to a higher Indigenous birth rate, people of Indigenous descent were also more willing to identify as Indigenous. According to Richard Broome: "identification as Indigenous is almost universal among those with a claim due to the growing pride in Indigenous identity in the face of stronger community acceptance."
[576]
Despite the drift to large cities, the period from 1965 to 1980 also saw a movement of Indigenous Australians away from towns and settlements to small
outstations
(or homelands), particularly in Arnhem Land and Central Australia. The movement to outstations was associated with a wider trend for the revival of traditional culture. However, the expense of providing infrastructure to small remote communities has seen pressure from federal, state and territory governments to redirect funding towards larger Indigenous communities.
[577]
From 1971 to 2006, indicators for Indigenous employment, median incomes, home ownership, education and life expectancy all improved, although they remained well below the level for those who were not indigenous.
[578]
In 2008, the
Council of Australian Governments
created targets for "closing the gap" in inequality in a number of key areas of education, employment, literacy and child mortality. By 2020, the outcomes for Indigenous Australians improved in most of these areas. However, the gap widened for child mortality and school attendance, and targets for closing the inequality gap were not met for employment and child literacy and numeracy. Targets for closing the gap in early childhood education and Year 12 school attainment were on track.
[579]
High rates of Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody were highlighted by the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in April 1991. The Keating government responded with $400 million in new spending to address some of the recommendations of the report. However, by 2001 Indigenous incarceration rates and deaths in custody had increased. Deaths in custody continued at an average of 15 per year during the decade to 2018.
[580]
Richard Broome has concluded: "To close the gap [between Indigenous and other Australians] on inequality and well being will take many years; some despairingly say generations. Compensation for lost wages, for missing out on native title settlements and for being removed from one's family and kin remain unresolved."
[581]
Women
A female police officer in 2008
Holmes and Pinto point out that in 1960 domesticity and motherhood were still the dominant conceptions of femininity. In 1961, women made up only 25 per cent of employed adults and twice as many women described their occupation as "home duties" compared with those in paid employment. The fertility rate fell from a post-war high of 3.5 to less than 2 in the 1970s and 1980s.
[582]
[583]
The reforming drive of the 1960s and the increasing influence of the women's movement led to a series of legislative and institutional changes. These included the abolition of the "marriage bar" in the Australian public service in 1966, the Arbitration Commission's equal pay decisions of 1969 and 1972, the introduction of paid maternity leave in the Australian public service in 1973, and the enactment of the federal
Sex Discrimination Act
in 1984 and the Affirmative Action Act of 1986.
[584]
Single mothers' benefits were introduced in 1973 and
the Family Law Act 1975
bought in no-fault divorce. From the 1980s there was an increase in government funding of women's refuges, health centres, rape crisis centres and information services.
[582]
The Australian government began funding child care with the Child Care Act of 1972, although state, territory and local government were still the main providers of funding. In 1984, the Australian government introduced standardised fee relief for child care, and funding was greatly expanded in 1990 by the decision to extend fee relief to commercial child care centres.
[585]
According to Holmes and Pinto, reliable birth control, increased employment opportunities, and improved family welfare and childcare provision increased opportunities for women outside motherhood and domesticity.
[582]
In 2019-20, women were more likely than men to hold a bachelor's degree or higher qualification. Sixty-eight per cent of women aged 20-74 years old participated in the labour force, compared with 78 per cent of men. However, 43 per cent of employed women were working part-time, compared with 16 per cent of men, and the average earnings of women working full-time was 14 per cent below that of men.
[586]
In the five-to-ten years to 2020, the number of women in private sector leadership roles, female federal Justices and Judges, and federal parliamentarians have all increased gradually.
[586]
However, between 1999 and 2021, Australia has fallen from ninth to 50th in the
Inter-Parliamentary Union
's ranking of countries by women's representation in national parliaments.
[587]
Migrants and cultural diversity
Malcolm Fraser: Committed to a multicultural Australia
In 1961, just over 90 per cent of the Australian population had been born in Australia, New Zealand, the UK or Ireland. Another eight per cent had been born in continental Europe.
[588]
The White Australia policy was in force and migrants were expected to assimilate into the Australian way of life. As the White Australia policy was gradually dismantled in the 1960s and formally abolished in 1973, governments developed a policy of multiculturalism to manage Australia's increasing cultural diversity. In August 1973 Labor's immigration minister Al Grassby announced his vision of
A Multi‐Cultural Society for the Future
and a policy of cultural pluralism based on principles of social cohesion, equality of opportunity and cultural identity soon gained bipartisan support. The Galbally Report on migrant services in 1978 recommended that: "every person should be able to maintain his or her culture without prejudice or disadvantage and should be encouraged to understand and embrace other cultures." In response to the report, the Fraser government expanded funding for settlement services, established the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs (AIMA), funded multicultural and community language education programs in schools and established the multi-lingual Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). State and territory government programs to support multiculturalism followed.
[589]
By the late 1980s Australia had a high migrant intake which included significant numbers of new arrivals from Asian and Middle‐Eastern countries, leading to public debate on immigration policy. In 1984, the historian Geoffrey Blainey called for a reduction in Asian immigration in the interests of social cohesion. In 1988, the opposition Leader, John Howard called for the abandonment of multiculturalism, a reduction in Asian immigration, and a focus on 'One Australia'. In the same year, the government's FitzGerald review of immigration recommended a sharper economic focus in the selection of immigrants. In 1989, the Hawke government released its
National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia
which endorsed respect for cultural diversity and the need for settlement services, but indicated that pluralism was limited by the need for "an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia".
[590]

Blacktown
Multicultural programs continued to expand between 1986 and 1996 with an emphasis on addressing disadvantage in migrant communities as well as settlement services for recent migrants.
[590]
James Walter argues that the Hawke and Keating governments (1983-96) also promoted high migration as a means of improving Australia's competitive advantage in a globalised market.
[591]
In 1996, Pauline Hanson, a newly elected independent member of parliament, called for a cut in Asian immigration and an end to multiculturalism. In 1998, her One Nation Party gained 23 per cent of the vote in the Queensland elections. The Howard government (1996 to 2007) initially abolished a number of multicultural agencies and reduced funding to some migrant services as part of a general program of budget cuts. In 1999, the government adopted a policy of "Australian multiculturalism" with an emphasis on citizenship and adherence to "Australian values".
[592]
Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the Bali bombings and other terrorist incidents, some media and political commentary sought to link terrorism with Islam. In 2004, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) reported an increase in vilification and violence against Australian Muslims and some other minority ethnic groups. The government increased funding for multicultural, citizenship and settlement programs, with an emphasis on the promotion of social cohesion and security.
[593]
The annual immigration intake also increased substantially as the economy boomed, from 67,900 in 1998-99 to 148,200 in 2006-07. The proportion of migrants selected for their skills increased from 30 per cent in 1995-96 to 68 per cent in 2006-07.
[493]
Immigration continued to grow under the Labor government (2007-13) with prime minister Kevin Rudd proclaiming a "big Australia" policy. The immigration intake averaged around 190,000 a year from 2011-12 to 2015-16, a level based on research indicating the optimum level to increase economic output per head of population. India and China became the largest source countries of new migrants.
[594]
The immigration intake was reduced to 160,000 in 2018-19 as some State governments complained that high immigration was adding to urban congestion. The opposition also linked high immigration with low wages growth while the One Nation party continued to oppose high immigration while proclaiming: "It's okay to be white.".
[595]
By 2020, 30 per cent of the Australian population were born overseas. The top five countries of birth for those born overseas were England, China, India, New Zealand and the Philippines. Australia's population encompassed migrants born in almost every country in the world,
[596]
Arts and culture
Main article:
Culture of Australia
The 1960s and 1970s saw increased government support for the arts and the flourishing of distinctively Australian artistic works. The
Gorton government
(1968-71) established the
Australian Council for the Arts
, the Australian Film Development Corporation (AFDC) and the National Film and Television Training School.
[597]
The Whitlam government (1972-75) established the Australia Council with funding to promote crafts, Aboriginal arts, literature, music, visual arts, theatre, film and television.
[598]
In 1966, a television drama quota was introduced requiring broadcasters to show 30 minutes of locally produced drama each week. The police series
Homicide
(1964-67) became the highest rating program and the family drama
Skippy the Bush Kangaroo
became a local and international success. By 1969 eight of the twelve most popular television programs were Australian. With these successes, locally produced dramas became a staple of Australian television in the 1970s and 1980s. Notable examples include
Rush
(1973-76),
The Sullivans
(1976-83) and
Neighbours
(1985-present).
[599]
From the late 1960s a "new wave" of Australian theatre emerged, initially centred on small theatre groups such as the
Pram Factory
,
La Mama
and the
Australian Performing Group
in Melbourne and the Jane Street Theatre and
Nimrod Theatre Company
in Sydney. Playwrights associated with the new wave included David Williamson, Alex Buzo, Jack Hibberd and John Romeril. Features of the new wave were the extensive use of Australian colloquial speech (including obscenities), the exploration of the Australian identity, and the critique of cultural myths. By the end of the 1970s new Australian plays were a feature of small and large theatre companies in most states.
[600]
Patrick White: In 1973, became the first Australian to win a Nobel Prize in Literature
Support through the AFDC (from 1975 the Australian Film Commission) and state funding bodies, and generous tax concessions for investors introduced in 1981, led to a large increase in Australian produced films. Almost 400 were produced between 1970 and 1985. Notable films include
The Adventures of Barry McKenzie
(1972),
Picnic at Hanging Rock
(1975),
My Brilliant Career
(1979),
Breaker Morant
(1980),
Gallipoli
(1981), the
Mad Max
trilogy (1979-85) and
Crocodile Dundee
(1986).
[601]
In 1973,
Patrick White
became the first Australian to win a Nobel Prize for Literature.
[602]
While there were only around twenty Australian novels published in 1973, this had grown to around 300 in 1988.
[603]
By 1985 more than 1,000 writers had received grants and more than 1,000 books had been subsidised by the Literature Board. Writers who published their first book between 1975 and 1985 include
Peter Carey
,
David Malouf
,
Murray Bail
,
Elizabeth Jolley
,
Helen Garner
and
Tim Winton
.
[604]
There was also a growing recognition of Indigenous cultural movements. In the early 1970s Aboriginal elders at
Papunya
began using acrylic paints to make "dot" paintings based on the traditional Honey Ant Dreaming. Indigenous artists from other regions also developed distinctive styles based on a fusion of modern art materials and traditional stories and iconography.
[604]
Indigenous writers such as
Oodgeroo Noonuccal
(Kath Walker),
Jack Davis
and
Kevin Gilbert
produced significant work in the 1970s and 1980s. A
National Black Theatre
was established in Sydney in the early 1970s. The Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre was established in 1976 and the
Bangarra Dance Theatre
in 1989. In 1991, the rock band
Yothu Yindi
, which drew on traditional Aboriginal music and dance, achieved commercial and critical success.
[605]
In music, ABC television's popular music show
Countdown
(1974-87) helped promote Australian music while radio station 2JJ (later JJJ) in Sydney promoted live performances and recordings by Australian independent artists and record labels.
[606]
Carter and Griffen-Foley state that by the end of the 1970s: "There was a widely shared sense of Australian culture as independent, no longer troubled by its relationship with Britain."
[604]
However, by 1990 commentators as diverse as
P. P. McGuiness
and
Geoffrey Serle
were complaining that the large increase in artistic works had led to the celebration of mediocrity. Poet
Chris Wallace-Crabbe
questioned whether Australia had overcome its former "
cultural cringe
" only to fall into cultural overconfidence.
[607]
In the new millennium, the globalisation of the Australian economy and society, and developments in jet travel and the internet have largely overcome the "
tyranny of distance
" which had influenced Australian arts and culture. Overseas cultural works could be more readily accessed in person or virtually. Australian performers such as the
Australian Ballet
and
Australian Chamber Orchestra
frequently toured abroad. The growing number of international art exhibitions, such as
Art Basel Hong Kong
and the Queensland Art Gallery's
Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art
, have increased the exposure of Australian art in the region and the wider global market.
[608]
[609]
In film, the number of Australian productions averaged 14 per year in the 1970s but grew to 31 per year in the 2000s and 37 per year in the 2010s.
[610]
A number of Australian directors and actors, including
Baz Luhrmann
,
George Miller
,
Peter Weir
,
Cate Blanchett
,
Nicole Kidman
,
Geoffrey Rush
and others, have been able to establish careers both in Australia and abroad. The technical expertise developed in the Australian industry, and the increasing number of internationally successful Australian directors and actors, encouraged foreign producers to make more films in Australia.
[608]
Major international productions made in Australia in the past decade include
Mad Max: Fury Road
and
The Great Gatsby
.
Carter and Griffen-Follet conclude: "Australia is no longer a Dominion or client state within a closed imperial market, but a medium-sized player, exporter as well as importer, within globalised cultural industries and markets."
[611]
Historiography
Donald Horne
's
The Lucky Country
(1964) is a critique of a "dull and provincial" Australia that gets by on its abundance of natural resources.
[612]
The book's title has been constantly misinterpreted since the book was published.
[613]
According to
Stuart MacIntyre
, the first Australian histories, such as those by
William Wentworth
and
James Macarthur
, were polemical works written to influence public opinion and British government policy in the colony. After the Australian colonies became self-governing in the 1850s, colonial governments commissioned histories aimed at promoting migration and investment from Britain. The beginning of professional academic history in Australian universities from 1891 saw the dominance of an Imperial framework for interpreting Australian history, in which Australia emerged from the successful transfer of people, institutions, and culture from Britain. The apogee of the imperial school of Australian history was the Australian volume of the
Cambridge History of the British Empire
published in 1933.
[614]
[615]
Military history received government support after the First World War, most prominently with
Charles Bean's
12 volume
History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918
(1921-42). Bean's earlier work as Australia's official war correspondent had helped establish the Anzac legend which, according to McKenna: "immediately supplanted all other narratives of nationhood - the march of the explorers, the advance of settlement, Eureka, Federation and Australia's record of progressive democratic legislation."
[616]
Geoffrey Blainey
's
The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History
(1966) posits that while Australians felt constrained by their distance to the rest of the world, its distance was largely surmounted and may have even worked in Australia's favour in some ways.
[617]
[612]
Radical nationalist interpretations of Australian history became more prominent from the 1930s.
Brian Fitzpatrick
published a series of histories from 1939 to 1941 which sought to demonstrate the exploitative nature of Britain's economic relationship with Australia and the role of the labour movement in a struggle for social justice and economic independence. One of the most influential works of the radical nationalist trend was
Russel Ward's
The Australian Legend
(1958) which sought to trace the origins of a distinctive democratic national ethos from the experiences of the convicts, bushrangers, gold-diggers, drovers and shearers. In the 1960s Marxist historians such as
Bob Gollan
and
Ian Turner
explored the relationship of the labour movement to radical nationalist politics.
[618]
The rapid expansion of university history departments in the 1950s and 1960s saw an increasing diversity of interpretations and specialisations in Australian history. A number of academic historians still worked within the imperial history tradition, while others explored the contribution of liberal, conservative and other traditions to Australia's distinctive political, cultural and economic development. In the first two volumes of his
History of Australia
(1962, 1968)
Manning Clark
developed an idiosyncratic interpretation of Australian history telling the story of "epic tragedy" in which "the explorers, Governors, improvers, and perturbators vainly endeavoured to impose their received schemes of redemption on an alien, intractable setting".
[619]
According to MacIntyre, Clark  "had few imitators and the successive volumes had a much greater impact on the public than the profession." The 1964 book
The Lucky Country
by
Donald Horne
was scathing in its observations of a complacent, dull, anti-intellectual and provincial Australia, with a swollen suburbia and absence of innovation-its title has been frequently misinterpreted as complimentary, though Horne meant it unfavourably. Another notable "big picture" interpretation of Australian history from this period is
Geoffrey Blainey
's
The Tyranny of Distance
(1966).
[620]
[621]
The 1970s saw a number of challenges to traditional imperial and nationalist interpretations of Australian history.
Humphrey McQueen
in
A New Britannia
(1970) attacked radical nationalist historical narratives from a Marxist New Left perspective.
Anne Summers
in
Damned Whores and God's Police
(1975) and
Miriam Dixson
in
The Real Matilda
(1976) analysed the role of women in Australian history. Others explored the history of those marginalised because of their sexuality or ethnicity.
[622]
Oral history became an increasingly prominent addition to traditional archival sources in a number of topic areas.
Wendy Lowenstein
's
Weevils in the Flour
(1978), a social history of the Great Depression, is a notable early example.
[623]
There was also a revival in Aboriginal history. Notable works include
Charles Rowley
's
The Destruction of Aboriginal Society
(1970),
Henry Reynolds
'
The Other Side of the Frontier
(1981) and Peter Reid's work on Aboriginal children who had been removed from their parents.
[624]
While Indigenous-settler relations remains an important field, Reid states that in the past few decades historians of Indigenous Australia have increasingly explored local histories and "the changing internal relations between individuals and family, clan and community."
[625]
Academic history continued to be influenced by British, American and European trends in historical method and modes of interpretation. Post-structuralist ideas on the relationship between language and meaning were influential in the 1980s and 1990s, for example, in
Greg Dening
's
Mr Bligh's Bad Language
(1992)
.
[626]
Memory studies and
Pierre Nora
's ideas on the relationship between memory and history influenced work in a number of fields including military history, ethnographic history, oral history and historical work in Australian museums.
[627]
Interdisciplinary histories drawing on the insights of fields such as sociology, anthropology, cultural studies and environmental studies have become more common since the 1980s.
[628]
Transnational approaches which analyse Australian history in a global and regional context have also flourished in recent decades.
[629]
Historians such as McKenna, MacIntyre and others point out that in the 21st century most historical works are not created by academic historians, and public conceptions of Australia's history are more likely to be shaped by popular histories, historical fiction and drama, the media, the internet, museums and public institutions. Popular histories by amateur historians regularly outsell work by academic historians. The internet and developments in digital technology mean that individuals and community groups can readily research, produce and distribute their own historical works. Local histories and family histories have proliferated in recent decades. A 2003 survey by the University of Technology, Sydney found that 32 per cent of respondents had engaged in family history or a history-related hobby.
[630]
[631]
These developments, along with the prevalence of interdisciplinary histories, have led some Australian historians to question the boundaries of history as an academic discipline. MacIntyre has questioned the claim that specialised procedures and forms of communication can protect the discipline from "the natural impulses of humanity" and "popular history". Clark and Ashton have stated that: "The accessibility of history has fundamentally changed how we perceive the discipline and raises an important question: Can anyone be an historian today?"
[632]
Historians have also questioned the boundaries between historical writing and other activities, particularly when they argue that groups have been marginalised by academic histories. Peter Reid states that  "Aboriginal history today takes form in dance, art, novel, biography, autobiography, oral history, archival research, family papers, drama, poetry and film."
[633]
History wars
The
history wars
were a series of public disputes about interpretations of Australian history involving historians, politicians and media commentators which occurred between approximately 1993 and 2007 but which had their roots in the revisionist histories from the 1970s and political debates about multiculturalism, Indigenous land rights, the stolen generations and national identity.
[634]
[635]
In a 1993 lecture, Geoffrey Blainey made a distinction between a "three cheers" view of history which saw Australian history as largely a success, and a "black armband" view which claimed that "much of Australian history was a disgrace". He opined that the "black armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self-congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced".
[636]
Three years later, the Prime Minister John Howard referred to Blainey's speech stating, "I profoundly reject the black armband view of Australian history. I believe the balance sheet of Australian history is a very generous and benign one. I believe that, like any other nation, we have black marks upon our history but amongst the nations of the world we have a remarkably positive history." He later defined black armband history as the view "that most Australian history since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination" and stated his intention to "ensure that our history as a nation is not written definitively by those who take the view that we should apologise for most of it."  In 1997, Howard repeated his criticism of black armband history in the context of the political controversies about Indigenous native title and the Stolen Generations, stating that contemporary Australians should not be held accountable for wrongs committed by past generations.
[636]
A number of historians, including Henry Reynolds, Elaine Thompson and
Don Watson
, responded publicly, variously accusing the prime minister of seeking to rewrite history to exclude the critical analysis of Australia's past and of misrepresenting recent Australian historiography for political purposes. However, historian
Patrick O'Farrell
, agreed with John Howard that the "guilt school of Australian history has gone too far".
[636]
In August 1996, the Brisbane newspaper The
Courier-Mail
published a series of articles alleging that Manning Clark (who had died in 1991 and had been closely associated with the opposition Labor party since 1972) had been "an agent of influence" for the Soviet Union. The newspaper explicitly linked its allegations to current political debates about Australia's history. John Howard commented that he considered Clark an unduly pessimistic black armband historian. The Press Council later found that the newspaper had had insufficient evidence for its allegation that Clark had been a Soviet agent.
[637]
National Museum of Australia: Battlefront in the History Wars
The
Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission
(HREOC), in 1997, released its
Bringing Them Home
report on the forced removal of Indigenous children from their families. The report found that between 10 per cent and 33 per cent of Aboriginal children had been forcibly separated from their parents between 1910 and 1970. The authors of the report stated that the policy of forced removals amounted to genocide and called for an apology to, and compensation for, the victims. Prime minister Howard offered his personal regret for the forced removals but he refused to offer a parliamentary apology, arguing that it might prejudice future legal actions and no government should be expected to apologise for the actions of previous governments. The release of the report and the government's response sparked a heated political, media and public debate about the facts of forced removals and the appropriate political response.
[638]
[639]
The anthropologist
Ron Brunton
published a paper in 1998 criticising the HREOC inquiry on various grounds including that the inquiry has not tested the claims of witnesses against the historical record. In 2000, the government claimed that a maximum of 10 per cent of Aboriginal children had been separated from their parents and that the policy was lawful and well-intentioned. A number of historians, including
Janet McCalman
and
Anna Haebich
, contributed to the political and academic debate.
[638]
[639]
Keith Windschuttle
published a series of articles in 2000 in which he argued that claims of frontier massacres and the Aboriginal death toll in frontier violence had been exaggerated by historians. In a subsequent book
The Fabrication of Aboriginal History
(2002) Windschuttle argued that there had been no genocide of Aboriginal Tasmanians and that historians had systematically misrepresented evidence about the nature and extent of violence against Aboriginal Tasmanians for political reasons. Geoffrey Blainey praised the book and it sparked a widespread and often acrimonious academic, media and public debate about settler violence against Aboriginal people and about Windschuttle's criticisms of particular historians.
[640]
A new battlefront in the history wars opened in 2000 when the council of the National Museum of Australia commissioned the historian Graeme Davison to review the explanatory labels for the museum's inaugural exhibition to determine whether they amounted to "the reworking of Australian history into political correctness." Davison found no political bias in the labels and the exhibition went ahead with the opening of the museum in March 2001. Following a number of media allegations of left-wing political bias in the museum's exhibitions, the museum council initiated another review which, in 2003, found that there was no systemic political or cultural bias in the museum.
[641]
A number of historians publicly criticised the inquiry as political interference in the independence of the museum.
[642]
In 2006, a Sydney newspaper reported that the director of the museum, Peter Morton was systematically reworking the collection, stating: "I want people to come out feeling good about Australia."

Fever Dream
is a novel by
Douglas Preston
and
Lincoln Child
. It was released on May 11, 2010 by Grand Central Publishing.
[1]
This is the tenth book in the Special Agent Pendergast series and also the first in the Helen trilogy.
[2]
The preceding novel is
Cemetery Dance
, and it is followed by
Cold Vengeance
.
Plot
[
edit
]
While visiting his family plantation in
New Orleans
,
Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast
inadvertently uncovers evidence that his wife Helen's death whilst on safari in Africa was no accident. He enlists the help of his friend, police lieutenant
Vincent D'Agosta
, in his search for Helen's killer. Their investigation quickly betrays just how little Pendergast knew about his wife, as they uncover her fascination with
John James Audubon
, a local painter whose work in chronicling the wildlife of America became very influential. Helen was searching for the
Black Frame
, a near-mythical painting made by Audubon when he was committed to a
sanatorium
. Pendergast and D'Agosta soon discover that Audubon's early work was particularly poor, and come to the conclusion that his sickness somehow triggered his artistic genius. However, their investigations have attracted the attentions of the same conspiracy responsible for Helen's murder, and when D'Agosta is put in mortal danger, Pendergast must turn to Captain Laura Hayward to venture deep into the Louisiana bayou and uncover the extent of the conspiracy. Helen was a researcher on Project Aves, an attempt to create a drug that could enhance a person's latent genius by modifying a rare strain of
avian influenza
. The project ended in disaster when an infected bird escaped quarantine and infected a local family. Upon learning that no attempt to recover the bird was made so that Project Aves could have human test subjects, Helen planned to reveal the conspiracy to the world and was murdered for it.
Once in the bayou, Pendergast finds the man responsible for Helen's death: Charles J. Slade, her former employer and the director of Project Aves. Slade has isolated himself from the world after contracting the same strain of influenza that Audubon had. After using his newfound genius to find a cure for
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
, he soon fell victim to the disease's side effects. The influenza destroyed his brain's ability to filter out sensations, leaving him trapped in a state of hyper-awareness. Every sensation is now as agonizing as it is overwhelming, pushing Slade further and further towards madness despite his efforts to manage the disease. Rather than killing him, Pendergast convinces Slade that
killing himself
is the only way he can escape the madness that will soon destroy the part of his brain that controls his sense of self. However, Slade refuses to reveal to Pendergast the name of the person who shot D'Agosta—Judson Esterhazy, Helen's brother.

Water stagnation
occurs when
water
stops
flowing
.
Stagnant water
can be a major
environmental hazard
.
[1]
Dangers
[
edit
]
Man drinking stagnant water in
Chad
.
Malaria
and
dengue
are among the main dangers of stagnant water, which can become a breeding ground for the
mosquitoes
that transmit these diseases.
[2]
Stagnant water can be dangerous for drinking because it provides a better incubator than running water for many kinds of
bacteria
and
parasites
. Stagnant water can be contaminated with
human
and animal
feces
, particularly in
deserts
or other areas of low rainfall.
[2]
Water stagnation for as little as six days can completely change bacterial community composition and increase cell count.
[3]
Stagnant water may be classified into the following basic, although overlapping, types:
Water body
stagnation (stagnation in swamp, lake, lagoon, river, etc.)
Surface
and
ground waters
stagnation
Trapped water stagnation. The water may be trapped in human artifacts (discarded cans, plant pots, tires, dug-outs, roofs, etc.), as well as in natural containers, such as hollow tree trunks, leaf sheath, etc.
To avoid ground and surface water stagnation,
drainage
of surface and
subsoil
is advised. Areas with a shallow
water table
are more susceptible to ground water stagnation due to the lower availability of natural soil drainage.
Life that may thrive in stagnant water
[
edit
]
Some plants prefer flowing water, while others, such as
lotuses
, prefer stagnant water.
Various
anaerobic
bacteria are commonly found in stagnant water.
[4]
For this reason, pools of stagnant water have historically been used in processing
hemp
and some other
fiber crops
, as well as
linden
bark
used for making
bast shoes
. Several weeks of soaking makes
bast fibers
easily separable due to bacterial and fermentative processes known as
retting
.
Denitrifying bacteria
Leptospira
Purple bacteria
(both sulfur and non-sulfur)
Fish
[
edit
]
Asian swamp eel
Lepisosteidae
(gar)
Northern snakehead
Pygmy gourami
Spotted barb
Walking catfish
Insects
[
edit
]
Stagnant water is the favorite breeding ground for a number of
insects
.
Dragonfly
nymphs
Fly
maggots
Mosquito
larvae
Nepidae
(water scorpions)
Other
[
edit
]
Algae
Biofilm
A number of species of
frogs
prefer stagnant water.
Some species of
turtles

-class submarine
. The joint development was between
Rubin Design Bureau
of Russia and
Fincantieri
of Italy. The project was suspended in 2014.
History
[
edit
]
It was reported in 2005 that Fincantieri of Italy had entered into a partnership with Russia's Rubin Design Bureau to design a new diesel-electric submarine based on the Russian
Amur
-class submarine
and featuring
air independent propulsion
(AIP) technology. In October 2006 at the
Euronaval
international arms show in France, Russia and Italy presented a mock-up model of a new-generation diesel submarine called S1000.
[1]
In July 2014 it was reported that Fincantieri requested indefinite postponement of the project, citing political situation resulting from Russia's involvement in
Ukraine crisis
.
[2]
[3]
As of 2020
, the project is likely still suspended.
[4]
The project may not continue as Russia is moving forward with their
Lada
-class submarine and Italy is building two additional German
Type 212 submarines
in addition to the four already completed.
Design
[
edit
]
The submarine was designed for anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare, reconnaissance missions, and transportation of up to 12 troops. It would have been 56.2 metres (184 ft 5 in) long, have a top speed of 14
knots
(26 km/h; 16 mph) and be equipped with a new fuel cell-powered AIP system developed by Italy.
Designed primarily for exports to third countries, the new submarine was to feature Italian heavyweight, wire-guided
Black Shark torpedoes
and the Russian
Club-S
cruise missile system capable of hitting underwater, surface and land targets.
[1]
Exports
[
edit
]
Both Fincantieri and Rubin gave a joint presentation to the
Indian Navy
offering to build six S1000 boats for $8.1 billion
[5]
for its
Project 75I-class submarine
programme.
[6]
The other contenders for the project included the
Scorpène class
of France, the
Type 214 submarine
of Germany, and the
Amur
class from Russia.

Gas turbine phenomenon
Comparison of normal and distorted airflow into the compressor section
[1]
A
compressor stall
is a local disruption of the airflow in the
compressor
of a
gas turbine
or
turbocharger
. A stall that results in the complete disruption of the airflow through the compressor is referred to as a
compressor surge
. The severity of the phenomenon ranges from a momentary power drop barely registered by the engine instruments to a complete loss of compression in case of a surge, requiring adjustments in the fuel flow to recover normal operation.
Compressor stall was a common problem on early jet engines with simple aerodynamics and manual or mechanical
fuel control units
, but has been virtually eliminated by better design and the use of hydromechanical and electronic control systems such as
Full Authority Digital Engine Control
. Modern compressors are carefully designed and controlled to avoid or limit stall within an engine's operating range.
Types
[
edit
]
An animation of an
axial compressor
showing both the
stator
blades and the
rotor
blades
There are two types of compressor stall:
Rotating stall
[
edit
]
Rotating stall
is a local disruption of
airflow within the compressor
which continues to provide compressed air, but with reduced effectiveness.  Rotating stall arises when a small proportion of
airfoils
experience
airfoil stall
, disrupting the local airflow without destabilising the compressor. The stalled airfoils create pockets of relatively stagnant air (referred to as
stall cells
) which, rather than moving in the flow direction, rotate around the circumference of the compressor. The stall cells rotate with the rotor blades, but at 50 to 70% of their speed, affecting subsequent airfoils around the rotor as each encounters the stall cell.  Propagation of the instability around the flow path annulus is driven by stall cell blockage causing an incidence spike on the adjacent blade.  The adjacent blade stalls as a result of the incidence spike, thus causing stall cell "rotation" around the rotor.  Stable local stalls can also occur which are axi-symmetric, covering the complete circumference of the compressor disc, but only a portion of its radial plane, with the remainder of the face of the compressor continuing to pass normal flow.
A rotational stall may be momentary, resulting from an external disturbance, or may be steady as the compressor finds a working equilibrium between stalled and unstalled areas. Local stalls substantially reduce the efficiency of the compressor and increase the structural loads on the airfoils encountering stall cells in the region affected. In many cases however, the compressor airfoils are critically loaded without capacity to absorb the disturbance to normal airflow such that the original stall cells affect neighbouring regions and the stalled region rapidly grows to become a complete compressor stall.
Axi-symmetric stall or compressor surge
[
edit
]
Axi-symmetric stall
, more commonly known as
compressor surge
; or
pressure surge
, is a complete breakdown in compression resulting in a reversal of flow and the violent expulsion of previously compressed air out through the engine intake, due to the compressor's inability to continue working against the already-compressed air behind it. The compressor either experiences conditions which exceed the limit of its pressure rise capabilities or is highly loaded such that it does not have the capacity to absorb a momentary disturbance, creating a rotational stall which can propagate in less than a second to include the entire compressor.
The compressor will recover to normal flow once the
engine pressure ratio
reduces to a level at which the compressor is capable of sustaining stable airflow.  If, however, the conditions that induced the stall remain, the return of stable airflow will reproduce the conditions at the time of surge and the process will repeat.
[2]
Such a "locked-in" or self-reproducing stall is particularly dangerous, with very high levels of vibration causing accelerated engine wear and possible damage, even the total destruction of the engine through the breaking of compressor and stator vanes and their subsequent ingestion, destroying engine components downstream.
Causes
[
edit
]
A compressor will only pump air in a stable manner up to a certain pressure ratio. Beyond this value the flow will break down and become unstable. This occurs at what is known as the surge line on a
compressor map
. The complete engine is designed to keep the compressor operating a small distance below the surge pressure ratio on what is known as the operating line on a compressor map. The distance between the two lines is known as the surge margin on a compressor map. Various things can occur during the operation of the engine to lower the surge pressure ratio or raise the operating pressure ratio. When the two coincide there is no longer any surge margin and a compressor stage can stall or the complete compressor can surge as explained in preceding sections.
Factors which erode compressor surge margin
[
edit
]
The following, if severe enough, can cause stalling or surging.
Ingestion of
foreign objects
which results in damage, as well as sand and dirt erosion, can lower the surge line.
Dirt build-up in the compressor and wear that increases compressor tip clearances or seal leakages all tend to raise the operating line.
Complete loss of surge margin with violent surging can occur with a
bird strike
. Taxiing on the ground, taking off, low level flying (military) and approaching to land all take place where bird strikes are a hazard. When a bird is ingested by a compressor the resultant blockage and airfoil damage causes compressor surging. Examples of debris on a runway or aircraft carrier flight deck that can cause damage are pieces of tire rubber, litter and nuts and bolts. A specific example is
a metal piece dropped from another plane
.
[3]
Runways and aircraft carrier flight decks are cleaned frequently in an attempt to preclude ingestion of foreign objects.
Aircraft operation outside its design envelope;
e.g.
, extreme flight manoeuvres resulting in airflow separations within the engine intake, flight in icing conditions where ice can build up in the intake or compressor, flight at excessive altitudes.
[4]
Engine operation outside its flight manual procedures;
e.g.
, on early jet engines abrupt throttle movements (
slam acceleration
) when pilot's notes specified slow throttle movements. The excessive over-fuelling raised the operating line until it met the surge line. (Fuel control capability extended to automatically limit the over-fuelling to prevent surging).
Turbulent or hot airflow into the engine intake,
e.g.
, use of
reverse thrust
at low forward speed, resulting in re-ingestion of hot turbulent air or, for military aircraft, ingestion of hot exhaust gases from missile firing.
Hot gases from gun firing which may produce inlet distortion;
e.g.
,
Mikoyan MiG-27
.
Effects
[
edit
]
Sukhoi Su-57
prototype suffering a compressor stall at
MAKS 2011
Compressor axially-symmetric stalls, or compressor surges, are immediately identifiable, because they produce one or more extremely loud bangs from the engine.  Reports of jets of flame emanating from the engine are common during this type of compressor stall. These stalls may be accompanied by an increased exhaust gas temperature, an increase in rotor speed due to the large reduction in work done by the stalled compressor and — in the case of multi-engine aircraft —
yawing
in the direction of the affected engine due to the loss of thrust.
Response and recovery
[
edit
]
The appropriate response to compressor stalls varies according to the engine type and situation, but usually consists of immediately and steadily decreasing thrust on the affected engine.  While modern engines with advanced control units can avoid many causes of stall, jet aircraft pilots must continue to take this into account when dropping airspeed or increasing throttle.
Notable stall occurrences

Aircraft development
[

Rolls-Royce Avon engine
[
edit
]
The
Rolls-Royce Avon
turbojet engine
was affected by repeated compressor surges early in its 1940s development which proved difficult to eliminate from the design. Such was the perceived importance and urgency of the engine that
Rolls-Royce
licensed the compressor design of the
Sapphire
engine from
Armstrong Siddeley
to speed development.
The engine, as redesigned, went on to power aircraft such as the
English Electric Canberra
bomber, and the
de Havilland Comet
and
Sud Aviation Caravelle
airliners.
Olympus 593
[
edit
]
During the 1960s development of the
Concorde
Supersonic Transport
(SST) a major incident occurred when a compressor surge caused a structural failure in the intake. The hammershock which propagated forward from the compressor was of sufficient strength to cause an inlet ramp to become detached and expelled from the front of the intake.
[5]
The ramp mechanism was strengthened and control laws changed to prevent a re-occurrence.
[6]
Aircraft crashes
[
edit
]
U.S. Navy F-14 crash
[
edit
]
A compressor stall contributed to the 1994 death of Lt.
Kara Hultgreen
, the first female
carrier-based
United States Navy
fighter pilot
.  Her aircraft, a
Grumman F-14 Tomcat
, experienced a compressor stall and failure of its left engine, a
Pratt & Whitney TF30
turbofan
, due to disturbed airflow caused by Hultgreen's attempt to recover from an incorrect
final approach
position by executing a
sideslip
; compressor stalls from excessive
yaw
angle were a known deficiency of this type of engine.
Southern Airways Flight 242
[
edit
]
The 1977 loss of
Southern Airways Flight 242
, a
McDonnell Douglas DC-9-9-31
, while penetrating a
thunderstorm
cell over
Georgia
was attributed to compressor stalls brought on by ingestion of large quantities of water and
hail
. The stalls caused blades to clash with stationary vanes in both of its
Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9
turbofan engines. The stalls were so severe as to cause the destruction of the engines, leaving the flight crew with no choice but to make an
emergency landing
on a public road, killing 62 passengers and another eight people on the ground.
1997 Irkutsk Antonov An-124 crash
[
edit
]
On December 6, 1997, an
Antonov 124
transport plane was destroyed when it
crashed
immediately after takeoff from
Irkutsk-2
Airport in Russia. Three seconds after lifting off from Runway 14, at a height of about 5 metres (16 ft), the number 3 engine surged. Climbing away with a high
angle of attack
, engines 1 and 2 also surged, causing the aircraft to crash some 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) past the end of the runway. It struck several houses in a residential area, killing all 23 on board, and 45 people on the ground.
[7]
Trans World Airlines Flight 159
[
edit
]
On November 6, 1967,
TWA Flight 159
, a
Boeing 707
on its
takeoff roll
from the then-named
Greater Cincinnati Airport
, passed
Delta Air Lines
Flight 379, a
McDonnell Douglas DC-9
stuck in the dirt a few feet off the
runway
's edge. The first officer on the TWA aircraft heard a loud bang, now known to have been a compressor stall induced by ingestion of exhaust from Delta 379 as it was passed.  Believing a collision had occurred, the copilot aborted the takeoff. Because of its speed, the aircraft overran the runway, injuring 11 of the 29 passengers, one of whom died four days later as a result of the injuries.
Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751
[
edit
]
In December 1991
Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751
, a
McDonnell Douglas MD-81
on a flight from Stockholm to Copenhagen, crashed after losing both engines due to ice ingestion leading to compressor stall shortly after takeoff. Due to a newly installed auto-throttle system designed to prevent pilots reducing power during the takeoff climb, the pilot's commands to reduce power on recognising the surge were countermanded by the system, leading to engine damage and total engine failure. The airliner successfully made a forced landing in a forest clearing without loss of life.

CSIRO
Exploration and Mining.
[9]
Louis Néel
’s 1955 paper
Some theoretical aspects of rock-magnetism
[10]
inspired Stacey to generalize Néel's single-domain theory for magnetic
grains
to multi-domained grains. In the theory of
remanence
for
igneous rocks
, Stacey introduced the concept of pseudo-single domain for magnetic grains which are small and multi-domained.

He did research on scientifically describing
rock fabric
using
magnetic anisotropy
[1]
[12]
and predicting earthquakes and volcanic eruptions using

Overview
[
edit
]
Teki Selenica was an Albanian government official known for having initiated and organized the registration of the first population census in the country. He published an encyclopedic guide book in two volumes: "Albania in 1927" and "Illustrated Albania". The first volume consists of three parts: "Political, Social and Economic Albania" (185 pages);  "Historical Albania" (161 pages); "Prefectures, sub-prefectures, communes, villages" (398 pages).
[2]
The second volume, rightly thought of as an illustrative and bilingual volume, published in 1928, adheres to the same structure of the first volume and has roughly 330 pages with a large collection of photographs of the then state buildings, of events and especially, of the people who made Albania a state. The book introduces us to the new developments of that period, highlighting the history of the people, the political actors of the time and provides accurate details about socio-economics and other aspects of daily life.

supported their 1997 album
Calling All Stations
with a 47-date European tour from 29 January to 31 May 1998, featuring shows in large arenas throughout Europe.
[1]
[2]
The core trio of lead vocalist
Ray Wilson
, keyboardist
Tony Banks
, and guitarist/bassist
Mike Rutherford
were joined by Israeli musician
Nir Zidkyahu
on drums, percussion, and backing vocals and Irish musician
Anthony Drennan
on guitar and bass.
[1]
[2]
This was the only tour with Wilson, Zidkyahu and Drennan, as well as the first since 1978 not to feature longtime singer/drummer
Phil Collins
or touring members
Daryl Stuermer
and
Chester Thompson
as part of the lineup. Rehearsals took place at
Bray Film Studios
in
Windsor
and the
Working Men's Club
in
Chiddingfold
, England close to the band's recording studio.
[1]
[2]
The tour concluded with spots at the
Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festival
in Germany.
[1]
[2]
A majority of the older songs were transposed in a lower key to accommodate Wilson's lower vocal range. Midway through the set included an acoustic medley of songs from their 1970s output.
[1]
[2]
[3]
A 23-date North American tour in large arenas was booked to start in November 1997 but it was cancelled due to insufficient ticket sales,
[1]
[2]
along with a revised 20-date schedule in smaller venues.
[1]
[2]
At the European tour's conclusion, Genesis went on hiatus; Wilson was later informed by Banks and Rutherford that the band would not be continuing. It would be the band's final full-length tour until Collins returned for the
2007 Turn It On Again reunion tour
. The tour is captured live on the promotional album
Calling Radio Stations
, and various unofficial albums.

Japanese
scenario writer originally from
Saitama
,
Japan
. He had worked for the
visual novel
studio
Key
under
VisualArt's
. He began working with Key on their sixth game
Little Busters!
and wrote the scenarios for two of the main heroines: Komari Kamikita, and Yuiko Kurugaya.
[1]
Tonokawa also wrote the scenario for Sasami Sasasegawa in
Little Busters! Ecstasy
. He provided the lyrics to one of the ending themes from the same game, "Alicemagic", as his first job as a
lyricist
. Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Chihaya Ohtori and Sizuru Nakatsu in Key's ninth game
Rewrite
.
[2]
Among Key's staff, Tonokawa updated the company's official
blog
the most often.
[3]
Despite his accomplishments, Tonokawa has referred to himself as "only an incompetent writer."
[4]
In July 2008, Tonokawa was living in the same apartment building in
Osaka
that
Jun Maeda
had once lived in, though he did not know this when he moved into the building.
[5]
Tonokawa resigned from Key in 2015.
Biography
[
edit
]
Early life
[
edit
]
Yūto Tonokawa started writing while in junior-high school, though these were only
short stories
. He stated himself that while he never read much, he did read
light novels
and modern literature while in junior-high. While in high school, Tonokawa read works by the
philosophers
Søren Kierkegaard
and
Ludwig Wittgenstein
, and
Japanese folklorists
Kunio Yanagita
and
Shinobu Orikuchi
.
[6]
Tonokawa at one point wanted to be either a
voice actor
or
manga author
, and it was not until after he entered high school that he decided to become a scenario writer. Since he wanted to participate in a job that told stories, he feels that either way he has achieved that goal.
[7]
While still in school, Tonokawa experimented on the
KiriKiri
scripting
engine
and made an amateur "novel game", but it did not have visuals or music. He felt it was a good learning experience as a scenario writer since he discovered how different it is to write regular stories compared to writing scenarios for a game.
[8]
Career
[
edit
]
Originally, Tonokawa came to
VisualArt's
and applied under a different brand under the publishing company, but coincidentally the timing was just right since
Jun Maeda
of
Key
was looking for another writer to join the team, which ultimately led to Tonokawa joining Key as a scenario writer.
[9]
Tonokawa was able to initially catch the attention of the application examiners with a 600-page
résumé
featuring a story centering on a female protagonist, but since there was no market for this format at the time, he later filled out a regular application.
[10]
As noted by himself, Tonokawa started working for Key almost immediately after graduating from university,
[11]
and he sees this as a major turning point in his life.
[12]
Tonokawa said that Maeda was a major influence on his life, and if not for Maeda, he would not be where he is today.
[13]
Originally, Tonokawa was supposed to work in the role of an outsourced writer who would help Maeda as a scenario assistant, but was brought in-house due to a quick need for a new writer.
[14]
Due to Maeda stepping down as the main scenario writer for Key after the production of
Little Busters! Ecstasy
,
[15]
Tonokawa was the sole writer within Key at the time.
At the time Tonokawa joined Key in August 2005, the team was working on debugging
Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life
.
[16]
He started working with Key on their sixth game
Little Busters!
and wrote the scenarios for two of the main heroines: Komari Kamikita, and Yuiko Kurugaya.
[1]
Tonokawa also wrote the scenario for Sasami Sasasegawa in
Little Busters! Ecstasy
. He provided the lyrics to one of the ending themes from
Little Busters!
, "Alicemagic", as his first job as a
lyricist
, though feels that composing music is difficult.
[17]
Tonokawa also wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako included in the
PlayStation 2
version of
Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life
.
[18]
Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Chihaya Ohtori and Sizuru Nakatsu in Key's ninth game
Rewrite
.
[2]
Tonokawa resigned from Key in 2015.

English merchant, politician and Lord Mayor of London
A
c.
1691
engraving of Pilkington by
Robert White
.
Sir Thomas Pilkington
(d. 1691) was an English merchant and
Whig
politician who served as the
Lord Mayor of London
in 1689.
Early life
[
edit
]
He was son of Thomas Pilkington of
Northampton
, by his second wife, Anne Mercer, and grandson of John Pilkington of
Oakham
in
Rutland
. He came to London at an early age, and became a successful merchant. He was a member of the
Skinners' Company
, and served the office of master there in 1677, 1681, and 1682.
Representative of the City of London
[
edit
]
Pilkington was an early Whig politician of the
Exclusion Crisis
, and was returned as one of the four
City of London
members to the short Parliament which met on 6 March 1679. In the course of the debate Pilkington expressed a wish that
James, Duke of York
might return from abroad, so that he might be impeached for
high treason
. He was again returned to the parliament of 1680. On 14 December in the same year he was elected alderman of the ward of
Farringdon Without
.
In June 1681 the citizens obtained a victory over the court interest, on the election of Pilkington and
Samuel Shute
as
sheriffs
, after a hotly contested poll, by a large majority over the court candidates, Ralph Box and Humphrey Nicholson. The election gave offence to the king; but Pilkington entertained at his house the
Duke of Monmouth
,
Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury
,
Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex
, and other leaders of the whig party. Meanwhile, the lord mayor,
Sir John Moore
, who led the court faction in the city, gave similar entertainments to its chiefs at his house in
Fleet Street
.
Roger North
claimed in his
Examen
that, on the trial of the Earl of Shaftesbury for high treason (24 November 1681), Pilkington showed great partiality in returning the
grand jury
, and was reprimanded by the judges.
In March 1682 Pilkington himself was tried at the Southwark assizes on a slight charge of
libel
, when the jury brought in a verdict of £800 damages for the plaintiff. Pilkington appealed on the ground of excessive damages, and eventually the case came before the
House of Lords
, by whom the judgment was confirmed 3 June 1689.
At the election of new sheriffs on midsummer day 1682, Pilkington and his fellow-sheriff Shute, who presided, defeated, by an exceptional exercise of their authority, the Lord Mayor Sir John Moore's efforts to secure the election of the court candidates,
Dudley North
and Ralph Box. The Lord Mayor on the following day attended with a deputation to inform the king that the sheriffs had behaved riotously. A privy council was summoned, the sheriffs were ordered to appear, and were accused of riotous conduct. Their trial, together with that of
Ford Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Warke
, Alderman
Henry Cornish
,
Sir Thomas Player
,
Slingsby Bethel
, and others, took place on 16 February 1683. They were found guilty on 8 May, and were fined on 26 June for various sums amounting to £4,100, Pilkington's fine being £500. (This judgment was later reversed by the House of Lords on a writ of error on 17 July 1689.)
Pilkington's shrievalty closed on 28 September 1682, when the outgoing sheriffs declined to entertain, according to custom, the lord mayor at dinner. The alleged riots fomented by Pilkington and Shute were made in part the ground for suspending the city's charter by the
quo warranto
of 1683.
On laying down his office, further difficulties confronted Pilkington. James, Duke of York had already brought against him an action of
scandalum magnatum
. He was charged with refusing to accompany a deputation of the corporation on 10 April 1682 to pay respect to the Duke on his return from Scotland, and with saying, in the presence of Aldermen Sir Henry Tulse and Sir William Hooker, that the Duke had burned the city, and was then coming to cut the citizens' throats. Damages were laid by the duke at £100,000. The cause was tried on 24 November 1682 in
Hertfordshire
, and the jury decided against Pilkington for the damages claimed. Pilkington thereupon surrendered to his bail, was committed to prison, and resigned the office of alderman, to which Sheriff North succeeded. After an imprisonment of nearly four years he was released by the king's order towards the end of June 1686.
On the flight of his old enemy, then King James II, and the arrival of the
Prince of Orange
in 1688, Pilkington enjoyed the royal favour. He was elected alderman of
Vintry
ward on 26 February 1689, and was restored to his former place and precedence in the court of aldermen. He was also returned as one of the city representatives in parliament. On the sudden death of Sir John Chapman, Lord Mayor, on 20 March 1689, Pilkington was elected for the remainder of the year. On 10 April 1689 he was knighted by the king; on Michaelmas day he was elected Lord Mayor for the next year; and at his installation banquet entertained the king and queen William and Mary, with
George
and
Anne
, the Prince and Princess of Denmark. The pageant was written by
Matthew Taubman
, the city poet.
The act which reversed the judgment in quo warranto (14 May 1690) directed that a Lord Mayor and the principal city officers should be elected on 26 May, and should continue in office until the date at which the tenure of the office customarily determined in the following year. Accordingly, Pilkington and Sir Jonathan Raymond, a tory, were returned by the livery to the court of aldermen, who for the third time elected Pilkington Lord Mayor. At the beginning of December 1690 the common council complained in a petition to the
House of Commons
that the lord mayor and court of aldermen had encroached upon their privileges. The matter was contested in parliament, and after heated discussions a motion for the adjournment of the debate was carried on 11 December by a majority of 197 against 184.
Death
[
edit
]
Pilkington did not long survive his third mayoralty, dying on 1 December 1691. His town residence was in Bush Lane, Scott's Yard, Cannon Street (London Directory, 1677).
A portrait of Pilkington is preserved at Skinners' Hall, and is reproduced in Wadmore's 'History of the Skinners' Company.' There is a contemporary engraving (1691) by
Robert White
, from a painting by Linton, and another by
Robert Dunkarton
, representing him in puritan costume.
Family
[
edit
]
Pilkington married Hannah Bromwich of London, by whom he had two sons.

, who unseated incumbent mayor
George Wuerch
.
An assembly ordinance and ballot proposition passed in Anchorage in 2003 had lowered the threshold required to avoid a mayoral runoff from 50% of the vote to 45%.
[2]
Since Begich surpassed this margin, no runoff was necessary.

Songsheet for
The Hunters of Kentucky
"
The Hunters of Kentucky
", also called "
The Battle of New Orleans
" and "
Half Horse and Half Alligator
", was a song written to commemorate
Andrew Jackson
's victory over the British at the
Battle of New Orleans
.  In both 1824 and 1828 Jackson used the song as his campaign song during his presidential campaigns.
[1]
[2]

Origin

Kentucky in the War of 1812
"Hunters on Kentucky" was originally published ca. 1815 in Boston and celebrated the courage of the Kentuckians who fought in the Battle of New Orleans.
[4]
[5]
One-fourth of Jackson's men at the Battle of New Orleans were from Kentucky.
[6]
It was sung the way Irish singers told stories in narrative form, and performed to the tune of
Ally Croker
and
The Unfortunate Miss Bailey
.
[1]
Written in 1821 by
Samuel Woodworth
, it was first sung in New Orleans in 1822 by Noah M. Ludlow.  When Ludlow first performed the song, the audience was filled with boatmen who had floated down the
Mississippi River
from Kentucky; they refused to let him leave the stage until he sang it two more times.
[1]
[7]
[8]
The "half horse and half alligator" description was a common expression for boatmen like
Mike Fink
and other backwoodsmen of the period.
[9]
[10]
Use
[
edit
]
Henry Clay
Throughout the term of Andrew Jackson, "Hunters of Kentucky" proved to be a popular song, and Jackson used it for his 1824 and 1828 campaign.  This is ironic as Jackson's "fieriest rival",
Henry Clay
, was the one from
Kentucky
; Jackson was actually from
Tennessee
, near
Nashville
.
[1]
Due to a copy of the song being depicted on the front cover of
Davy Crockett's Almanack of Wild Sports in the West
, it is thought that "Hunters of Kentucky" might have been sung during the
Texas War of Independence
, but this is speculation as no other evidence supports the song being sung during that conflict.  However, Americans who entered
Canada
in
1837 and 1838
did sing the song.
[11]
"Hunters of Kentucky" propagated various beliefs about the war.  One of them was calling the Pennsylvania Rifle the
Kentucky Rifle
.  Another was crediting the riflemen with the victory of the Battle of New Orleans, when it could be said it was Jackson's artillery that was actually responsible for the win.  Finally, one stanza said that the British planned to ransack New Orleans, which was unlikely to happen.
[12]
Lyrics
[
edit
]
Ye gentlemen and ladies fair
Who grace this famous city,
Just listen, if you've time to spare,
While I rehearse a
ditty
;
And for the opportunity
Conceive yourselves quite lucky,
For 'tis not often that you see
A hunter from Kentucky.
Refrain:
Oh Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky!
Oh Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky!
Alligators
We are a hardy, free-born race,
Each man to fear a stranger;
Whate'er the game, we join in chase,
Despising toil and danger.
And if a daring foe annoys,
Whate'er his strength and forces,
We'll show him that Kentucky boys
Are
alligator
horses.
Refrain
I s'pose you've read it in the prints,
How
Packenham
attempted
To make old Hickory Jackson wince,
But soon his scheme repented;
For we, with rifles ready cock'd,
Thought such occasion lucky,
And soon around the gen'ral flock'd,
The hunters of Kentucky.
Refrain
You've heard, I s'pose, how New-Orleans
Is fam'd for wealth and beauty—
There's girls of ev'ry hue, it seems,
From snowy white to sooty.
So Packenham he made his brags,
If he in fight was lucky,
He'd have their girls and cotton bags,
In spite of old Kentucky.
Refrain
Andrew Jackson
But Jackson he was wide awake,
And was not scar'd at trifles,
For well he knew what aim we take,
With our Kentucky rifles:
So he led us down by
Cypress
swamp,
The ground was low and mucky;
There stood
John Bull
in martial pomp,
And here was old Kentucky.
Refrain
A bank was rais'd to hide our breasts,
Not that we thought of dying,
But that we always like to rest,
Unless the game is flying.
Behind it stood our little force,
None wished it to be greater,
For ev'ry man was half a horse,
And half an alligator.
Refrain
They did not let our patience tire,
Before they show'd their faces;
We did not choose to waste our fire,
So snugly kept our places.
But when so near we saw them wink,
We thought it time to stop 'em,
And 'twould have done you good, I think,
To see Kentuckians drop 'em.
Refrain
The British found, 'twas vain to fight,
Where lead was all their booty,
And so they wisely took to flight,
And left us all the beauty.
And now, if danger e'er annoys,
Remember what our trade is;
Just send for us Kentucky boys,
And we'll protect ye, ladies.
Refrain

(
July 2021
)
Andrea Chiaramonte
(???? - 1 June 1392) was a representative of the Sicilian nobility in the
14th century
.
Andrea Chiaramonte was given the
County of Modica
, which included the municipalities of
Modica
,
Ragusa
,
Scicli
,
Pozzallo
,
Ispica
,
Chiaramonte Gulfi
,
Comiso
,
Giarratana
,
Monterosso Almo
. He was the lord of
Caccamo
,
Castronovo
, of the castle of
Palma di Montechiaro
, and of the castle of
Mussomeli
. He also inherited the title of
Count of Malta
and
Gozo
from his father
Manfredi Chiaramonte
. He established his court at the
Palazzo Steri
in
Palermo
.
Andrea succeeded Manfredi as the seventh count of Modica, and continued the policy of aversion to the Aragonese of Sicily. When
Martin I
became king of Sicily following his marriage to
Maria di Sicilia
, he then reconquered the island militarily, the Chiaramontes found themselves together with the Alagonas alone to face the Catalan army of Bernat (or Bernardo)
Cabrera
.
Andrea, defeated and betrayed, was captured on May 17 along with Manfredo Alagona, and the archbishop of Palermo. He was
sentenced to death
for the felony of rebellion, and executed by beheading on 1 June 1392 in Palermo in front of the
Steri palace
.
[1]
With him, the Chiaramonte family diminished as their assets were confiscated and divided between
Guglielmo Raimondo II Moncada
, the Sidoti and Landolina.

History
[
edit
]
The Old Thomas Road Baptist Church (Now the Ramp Church International)
Begun in 1956 by a group of thirty-five, including
Jerry Falwell
, Thomas Road now claims more than 24,200 members. In 1971, the church founded Lynchburg Baptist College, now known as
Liberty University
, as well as
Liberty Christian Academy
(known as Lynchburg Christian Academy until it moved and was renamed in 2005).  Until 2004, the church was the location for a nationally syndicated religious broadcast known as
The Old-Time Gospel Hour
.  This program now airs only locally in Lynchburg.  Selected sermons from the pulpit of the Thomas Road Baptist Church are now featured nationally on a syndicated program from Liberty University known as
Live from Liberty
.
[2]
The church occupied a new multimillion-dollar facility on July 2, 2006.  The new building is connected to an over 800,000 sq ft (74,000 m
2
) facility formerly owned and operated by the
Ericsson
electronics manufacturer.  The existing building has been renovated to house offices, university classes, the new
Liberty University School of Law
, and the Liberty Christian Academy. The church offers a variety of events and speakers, such as a
creationist
conference by
Answers in Genesis
.
[3]
Founding pastor Falwell served as its senior pastor until his death in 2007. In a special business meeting called by the board of
deacons
on June 3, 2007,
Jonathan Falwell
was unanimously elected by the
congregation
to assume his father's duties as senior pastor of the church. Jonathan Falwell had previously served as the church's executive pastor since 1994.
[4]
Jerry Falwell started Lynchburg Baptist College by selling bonds to a small group of private investors. However, in 1972, the
Securities and Exchange Commission
investigated the bonds alleging Falwell's church committed "fraud and deceit" in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds.
[5]
The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the behest of the SEC, in which the court exonerated the church and ruled that there had been no intentional wrongdoing.
[6]
Affiliation
[
edit
]
Thomas Road Baptist Church was initially affiliated with the
Baptist Bible Fellowship International
.  However, since 1998, it has a dual affiliation with the Baptist Bible Fellowship and the
Southern Baptist Convention
, having entered the convention by way of the
Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia
.

[1]
James G. Matkin
,
QC
(born 1942) is a former
British Columbia
, Canada
deputy minister
of labour and of intergovernmental relations, former President and
CEO
of the Business Council of British Columbia, and a former
British Columbia
Law Society secretary and executive director.  He led drafting of the Labour Code Of B.C. in 1973, and legislation for the first human rights code of BC, floated the
Non Obstante clause
compromise that was adopted in the
Canadian Constitution
and Charter of Rights in 1981, and is credited with "cleaning up" the Vancouver stock exchange through his one-man commission of enquiry. He studied law and economics at Harvard as a Frank Knox Fellow graduated with an LL.M. in 1969. He is a self-proclaimed "most viewed writer" in climatology and
carbon emissions
in Quora.
[2]
He is one of the editors of Academia.edu and active with posts on negotiation and climate.
[3]
Early life
[
edit
]
Originally from
Alberta
,
[4]
He obtained his bachelor's and master's (law) degrees from
University of Alberta
and a Master of Laws from Harvard Law School
[5]
[6]
and became a law clerk in 1970 to Supreme Court of Canada Justice,
Ronald Martland
and an assistant professor
of law at the
University of British Columbia
.
[7]
Professional life
[
edit
]
While a
University of British Columbia
law faculty member, he was invited to be part of a government-appointed Committee of Special Advisors assembled to draft legislation which became the Labour Code of British Columbia Act of 1973.
[8]
At age 30, he became deputy minister of labor in
British Columbia
. He was then the youngest deputy minister in the history of BC.
[9]
From 1981 he was Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental Relations.
[10]
He left the bureaucracy July 1, 1983, with the congratulations of Honorable
Garde Gardom
: " Mr. Matkin has performed long and in a most dedicated fashion, under two different administrations, always in the interests of the general public of our province. He's been a dedicated public servant."
[1]
Non Obstante Clause
[
edit
]
Matkin's associate,
Paul C. Weiler
, a former BC Labour Relations Board head, had written a
McGill Law Journal
paper that recommended a Non Obstante Clause be inserted
[11]
in the
Canadian constitution
.  This would allow a Canadian
province
to "opt out" of portions of the new constitution. Matkin's staff altered a "no author text" to include this concept.
[12]
The "no author text" (or a document with no author named) was circulated at a constitutional conference attended by Canadian first ministers and their staff.  This clause bears close resemblance to the
Notwithstanding clause
that ultimately became an ingredient in the
Kitchen Accord
among most Canadian provinces and the federal government of Canada.
Later career
[
edit
]
"From 1983-93, he served as President and CEO of the B.C. Business Council...."
[13]
He was also a director of the Bank of Canada, serving from 1992 to 1995.
[5]
In 1996, Matkin was chosen to head a commission to oversee the reduction in size of the British Columbia fishing fleet.
[14]
Matkin was a committee of one who investigated and in 2004 "denounced" the
Vancouver Stock Exchange
"as a breeding ground for swindles and laid the blame at the feet of the B.C. Securities Commission".
"...[H]is report served as an official wake-up call. The exchange began blackballing miscreant promoters, then merged with the Alberta Stock Exchange to form the Canadian Venture Exchange, and was later acquired by the more respectable Toronto Stock Exchange, resulting in the TSX Venture Exchange."
[15]
Resignation from BC Law Society
[
edit
]
He was the executive director of the BC Law Society from 1998 to 2004.
[16]
On December 6, 2004, Matkin resigned.  This came in response to concerns raised at the society that he had become involved with a junior company with two alleged stock offenders.  "Matkin denied any improper conduct. He argued that [alleged offenders] Gujral and Alexander had learned from their mistakes and deserved a second chance. He also said he sought and obtained assurances that Alexander would not promote the company's shares, only the technology."
[17]
"There has never been any suggestion that Matkin did anything illegal. The issue is simply whether it was appropriate for him to be dealing with a company associated with Gujral and Alexander."
[17]
The then-president of the Canadian Bar Association, British Columbia branch, expressed regret that an enquiry did not occur due to Matkin's resignation.  "I dare say it would have assisted all to know whether the Executive Director, given the leadership role inherent in this position, is expected to meet an elevated ethical standard, and if so, what that standard entails .... [T]his [resignation] represents the loss of an important opportunity for the Benchers to articulate, for the profession generally and for the previous and next incumbent, the standards expected of the individual appointed to this key position in the organization."
[18]
The BC Law Society dismissed a complaint of impropriety filed December 31, 2004, by a lawyer.
[19]
Legacy
[
edit
]
Matkin's legacy includes the BC Labour Relations board and legislation, changes to the
Vancouver Stock Exchange
,
[20]
and the first human rights code in BC.
In later life, Matkin has turned to producing self-published opinion pieces on
climatology
via
Academia.edu
, articulating his position of
climate change denial
, his belief in the
Global warming conspiracy theory
,
[21]
and criticizing political and economic reforms aimed at avoiding or mitigating anthropogenic climate change, which he attributes to the political left.
[22]
These articles consist mainly of articles written by other
climate change deniers
and republished with additional commentary by Matkin.

The
threadfin jack
or
thread pompano
(
Carangoides otrynter
) is a species of coastal
marine
fish
in the jack
family
Carangidae
. The species inhabits the tropical waters of the eastern
Pacific Ocean
from
Baja California
in the north to
Ecuador
and the
Galapagos Islands
in the south. It is a moderately large fish, growing to 60 cm (24 in) and may be recognized by its filamentous
dorsal
and
anal fin
lobes. The threadfin jack inhabits both deeper
coastal
waters and
inshore
environments, including
reefs
and
estuaries
, where it preys on minute
benthic
and
pelagic
organisms, including small fishes and
crustaceans
. Very little is known about the ecology and reproductive cycle in the species. The threadfin jack is of importance to
fisheries
throughout its distribution, caught by
hook-and-line
and
net
methods and marketed fresh and salted, and is considered a very good
table fish
. The species was named
Carangoides dorsalis
by
Theodore Gill
20 years before the name
Caranx otrynter
was introduced, but confusion with
Vomer dorsalis
led to the proposal of the new name to separate the two species.
Taxonomy and naming
[
edit
]
The threadfin jack is classified within the
genus
Carangoides
, one of a number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and trevallies.
Carangoides
falls into the jack and horse mackerel family
Carangidae
, the Carangidae are part of the
order
Carangiformes
.
[2]
The species was first
scientifically described
by the American
ichthyologist
Theodore Gill
, who named the species
Carangoides dorsalis
based on the
holotype
taken from the west coast of
Central America
.
[3]
This name and description was published in the
Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences
of Philadelphia, in which Gill one year previously described another carangid,
Vomer dorsalis
.
[4]
The state of carangid
taxonomy
at the time was rather confusing, with many synonymous genera and species present in the literature, and
Vomer dorsalis
was soon moved to
Caranx
, as was
Carangoides dorsalis
, creating a taxonomic
homonym
. To address this problem, the American ichthyologists
David Starr Jordan
and
Charles Henry Gilbert
in 1883 created the name
Caranx otrynter
as a replacement for the species originally named
Carangoides dorsalis
, basing their description on a new holotype specimen taken from
Mazatlán
, Mexico.
[5]
The authors indicated that if
Vomer
was found to be a valid genus or subgenus,
Vomer dorsalis
could be reinstated and the original combination of
Caranx dorsalis
be restored. Despite
V. dorsalis
being transferred to
Selene dorsalis
, this never occurred and in a 1994 publication, Gerald Allen and D. Ross Robertson placed
Caranx otrynter
into the genus
Carangoides
,
[6]
where it has remained ever since. The specific name
otrynter
is derived from Latin, and means a driver, in allusion to the
whip
-like ray of the second dorsal fin.
[5]
The common names of the species, threadfin jack and thread pompano, also refer to the filamentous, threadlike dorsal fin.
[

]
Description
[
edit
]
The threadlike dorsal and anal fin tips are characteristic.
The threadfin jack is a moderately large species, growing to a known maximum length of 60 cm.
[7]
The species is similar in appearance to a number of jacks in the genera
Carangoides
and
Alectis
in its adult form, having a compressed,
oblong
body, with the
dorsal
and ventral profiles approximately equal in
concavity
. The head profile is quite angular, being most steep immediately above the mouth, and being moderately steep to the
nape
, becoming more horizontal
posteriorly
. The juveniles have a more oval to diamond shape, looking much like juveniles of the genus
Alectis
.
[8]
The
dorsal fin
is in two parts, the first being greatly diminished and consisting of eight
spines
entirely embedded in the skin, with the second dorsal fin composed of one spine and 18 or 19
soft rays
. The
anal fin
is composed of two
anteriorly
detached spines followed by one spine and 16 or 17 soft rays.
[8]
Both juveniles and adults have highly elongated second dorsal and anal fin lobes, extended out into long filaments; they are most pronounced in juveniles.
[9]
The
lateral line
has a moderate, regular arch anteriorly, which is roughly equal in length to the straight posterior section. The straight section has no to 15
scales
followed by 40 to 52 small
scutes
. The breast is devoid of scales ventrally to behind the
pelvic fin
origin and diagonally up to the
pectoral fin
base. Both
jaws
contain uniform bands of small, weak teeth becoming wider posteriorly and irregular conical outer teeth in adults. It has 21 to 23
gill rakers
and 24
vertebrae
.
[8]
In life, the threadfin jack is a silvery-blue above, becoming silvery-white on the underside, with golden to yellow reflections. The first dorsal and pelvic fin is grey, while the second dorsal, anal, pectoral, and
caudal fins
are
hyaline
or grey with a yellow tinge. Juveniles have clear, dark, vertical bands, fading with age. Much like the
shadow trevally
, small black spots occur on the bases of soft dorsal rays and the body immediately below them that increase in size with age, with a small black blotch on the upper
operculum
.
[8]
Distribution and habitat
[
edit
]
The threadfin jack is distributed throughout the
tropical
regions of the eastern
Pacific Ocean
, inhabiting the western coast of the
Americas
. The northern limit to the species range is southern
Baja California
, with its range extending south to
Mexico
and
Central America
to a southern limit of
Ecuador
, with the species also recorded from the
Galapagos Islands
.
[7]
It is one of only two species of the genus
Carangoides
found on the western coastline of the Americas, with the other species being the widely distributed
island trevally
,
Carangoides orthogrammus
.
[8]
The species appears to undergo a major transition in lifestyle after its juvenile phase, with young individuals leading a
pelagic
lifestyle, able to be transported to
offshore
islands such as the Galapagos by currents. Older individuals are more
benthic
in nature, inhabiting the bottom of the water column in mostly
coastal
waters on
reefs
.
[10]
Smaller fish have been recorded from
estuaries
,
mangrove
-lined creeks, shallow
bays
, and
lagoons
,
[11]
although larger fish live in much deeper waters up to 50 m (160 ft) in depth.
[12]
Biology and fishery
[
edit
]
Much of biology and ecology of the threadfin jack is unknown, with the species' diet the only studied aspect of its biology. A study in fishes of the continental shelf of
Colombia
found the species takes predominantly small, benthic fishes of the families
Triglidae
,
Synodontidae
, and
Batrachoididae
. Other common prey included benthic
crustaceans
, including various
crabs
and
shrimp
.
[13]
Nothing is known of its reproductive cycle.
[
citation needed
]
The threadfin jack is of some importance to
fisheries
throughout its range, although individual catch statistics for the species are not kept. It is often caught by hook-and-line methods or by
gill nets
and various artisanal traps. It is considered to be good to excellent
table fare
, and is marketed both fresh and
salted
.
[8]
The species has also been found at a number of
archaeological
sites in both
Panama
and Ecuador, indicating it has been caught by humans for food for at least 3450 years.
[11]
[14]
The threadfin jack is also of interest to
anglers
who catch the species occasionally, and is considered a minor
gamefish
. Juveniles are occasionally caught from shore, such as
piers
and
breakwaters
, while larger individuals are caught over deeper reefs. The species takes a variety of
bait
, including fish and prawns, but they also take
lures
, including hard and small, fly-like Sabiki lures.

Chickens Come Home
is a 1931 American
pre-Code
short film starring
Laurel and Hardy
, directed by
James W. Horne
and produced by
Hal Roach
. It was shot in January 1931 and released on February 21, 1931. It is a remake of the 1927 silent film
Love 'em and Weep
in which
Jimmy Finlayson
plays Hardy's role and Hardy plays a party guest.
Plot
[
edit
]
Laurel and Hardy are Dealers in High Grade Fertilizer according to their door.
Ollie is sitting at a desk smoking a fat cigar, he asks his assistant to fetch the General Manager, Mr Laurel. Laurel says he has been in the "sampler room". He dictates an acceptance speech to Laurel, which tells us that he is standing for mayor.
Ollie is confronted at his office by an old flame (
Mae Busch
) who
threatens to publish
an old photograph of herself on the shoulders of Ollie at the beach if she is not paid off. Ollie agrees to meet her that evening to make a settlement. The woman is hastily concealed in the bathroom when Mrs. Hardy (
Thelma Todd
) arrives to remind Ollie that they will be hosting a dinner party that evening. Mrs. Hardy spots the white ermine fur belonging to the first woman and Ollie says it is an early Christmas present. She leaves with the fur. The blackmailing woman leaves demanding Ollie goes to her apartment that night. Ollie recruits employee Stan to go to the woman's apartment while Ollie attends the party. They phone Stan's wife to explain he will be late but she tells Ollie she will break Stan's arms if he is late. Ollie simply tells Stan he can be out as long as he wants.
Stan goes to the blackmailer's apartment with a bunch of flowers. The woman demands Ollie's telephone number, and she calls him during his dinner party, touching off a variety of misunderstandings and suspicions of unfaithfulness between the boys, their wives, Ollie's butler and Mrs. Laurel's gossipy friend.
The woman eventually makes it to Ollie's house, despite Stan's efforts; Ollie passes her off as Mrs. Laurel to avoid suspicion. After the guests leave, Ollie threatens to kill the woman and then himself, causing her to faint. Mrs Hardy says she will arrange the guest bedroom for "Mr. and Mrs. Laurel" to stay in. Stan looks worried. The real Mrs. Laurel arrives armed with a hatchet and Stan flees.

Spanish version
[
edit
]
A Spanish-language version of this film was completely re-shot with the stars delivering their lines in phonetic Spanish. It was expanded to one hour by adding scenes of magician Abraham J. Cantu and vaudeville
regurgitator
Hadji Ali
performing at the Hardy dinner party. Titled
Politiquerias
, the film was released in Latin American and Spanish markets as a feature.
Joining headliners Laurel and Hardy in this version is a supporting cast of native Spanish speakers:
Linda Loredo
portrays Mrs. Hardy, Carmen Granada is Mrs. Laurel, and
Rina De Liguoro
is in the Mae Busch role as Oliver's old girlfriend. James Finlayson, however, reprises his role as the Hardy butler and still absorbs the abuse—and even more—from the magician and the regurgitator in the added scenes.

Poverty
[
edit
]
Archbishop has expressed his belief that the poor do not go to heaven. Along with God, he will stop the poor from entering heaven.
God will not entertain the poor in heaven. You will not go there. I will also stand at the entrance to stop you from going there. We have misunderstood the gospel. Being poor should not be misinterpreted to be without money.
God will say I created you with eyes, the brain, and gave you life, and you die poor?!. You will perish in hell. We should work hard. Let’s not sleep and be idle.

The monastery complex
The town square, called just
Náměstí
("The Square") has regular rectangular shape. Its main landmark is the town hall, mentioned already in the 14th century. The tower was added in 1525. It was rebuilt after a fire in 1610 and decorated with
sgraffito
. In the middle of the square is a Baroque Marian column from 1678.
[6]
The Church of the Holy Trinity is as old as the town. Its main part is from the Renaissance period. It has a 53 metres (174 ft)-high tower with two bells from 1599 and 1612.
[6]
The Church of Saint
Francis of Assisi
from 1598 was originally a small cemetery church. In 1678-1684, the
Franciscan
monastery was built next to the church and the church was donated to the monks, who later extended it. Today, the monastery church houses a unique collection of plaster casts of ancient sculptures dating from 1912.

Lodovico Nogarola
(died 1558) was an Italian
Renaissance humanist
, politician, and
man of letters
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Lodovico Nogarola was born of an ancient noble family of
Verona
.
[1]
He applied himself to the study of the
Greek language
, and acquired a high reputation by the various
Latin
versions of books written in that tongue. He was sent to the
council of Trent
, where he served as secretary at the theological discussions and gained much applause by a discourse pronounced by him on
Saint Stephen's Day
before the assembled legates and bishops.
[2]
[3]
Nogarola's sermon is printed under the title:
Oratio L. Nogarolae comitis habita in Concilio Tridentino divi Stephani celebritate MDXLV
(Venice 1549). He died at Verona in 1558.
[4]
Works
[
edit
]
Of his many writings a large number remained unpublished.
[1]
In 1549 he published at Venice,
Apostolicæ Institutiones in parvum Libellum collectæ
, to which he annexed his discourse delivered before the council of Trent. He also published
Timotheus, sive de Nilo
;
Platonicæ Plutarchi Quæstiones in Latinum versæ, et Annotationibus illustratæ
; a translation of a work of
Ocellus Lucanus
,
De Universa Natura
; Letter to Adamo Fumano, Canon of Verona, on the Persons of illustrious Italian Families who have written in Greek; this is given in the
Supplementa et Observationes ad Vossium de Historicis Græcis et Latinis
, by
Johann Albert Fabricius
, published at Hamburg in 1709;
Scholia ad Themistii Paraphrasim in Aristotelis Librum Tertium de Anima
, with a Latin translation of that work; and
Disputatio super Reginæ Britannorum Divortio

History

This section

(
December 2016
)
The
Martyrology
of
Ado
gives St. Front as the first bishop of Périgueux;
Saint Peter
is said to have sent him to this town with the St. George to whom later traditions assign the foundation of the church of
Le Puy
. Subsequent biographies, which appeared between the 10th and 13th centuries, make St. Front's life one with that of
St. Fronto of Nitria
, thereby giving it an Egyptian colouring. At all events we know by the
Chronicle of
Sulpicius Severus
that a Bishop of Périgueux, Paternus, was deposed for heresy about 361.
Among its bishops are:
Raymond V, Cardinal of Pons
(1220-1223)
the future cardinal,
Hélie de Bourdeilles
(1447-1468)
Claude de Longwy
, Cardinal of Givry, who was only the administrator, not the bishop, from 27 August 1540 to 27 August 1541.
[1]
the future
Cardinal Gousset
(1836-1840), subsequently
Archbishop of Reims
.
The
Abbey of Saint-Sauveur of Sarlat
, later placed under the patronage of
St. Sacerdos of Limoges
, seems to have existed before the reigns of
Pepin the Short
and
Charlemagne
who came there in pilgrimage and because of their munificence deserved to be called "founders" in a Bull of
Pope Eugene III
(1153). About 936
St. Odo, Abbot of Cluny
, was sent to reform the abbey. The abbey was made an episcopal see by
pope John XXII
, on 13 January 1318.

Nightclub in San Francisco, US, famous for stand-up comedy 1950s & 1960s
Eric Nord, 1959, Los Angeles
The
Hungry I
(stylized as
hungry i
) was a
nightclub
in
San Francisco, California
, originally located in the
North Beach
neighborhood. It played a major role in the history of
stand-up comedy
in the United States.
[1]
It was launched by
Eric "Big Daddy" Nord
, who sold it to
Enrico Banducci
in 1951. The club moved to
Ghirardelli Square
in 1967 and operated mostly as a rock music venue until it closed in 1970.
[2]
The name of the nightclub was reused later as a strip club in San Francisco, from the late 1960s until 2019.
Name
[
edit
]
"In 1950, I was acting and designing sets for an amateur theatrical group. One of the men said he wanted to start a small club where actors could go after rehearsals and have coffee, pastry, a beer, et cetera, and sit around and talk—unwind from the work. He asked if I would design the interior, and also think of a name. I came up with hungry i—which referred to all the various hungers of the first person singular. The other man changed his name and personality as the club developed, and became Big Daddy Eric Nord of the
Beat Generation
." — Mark Adams, artist
[3]
[4]
In another story, the lower-case "i" was meant to represent "intellectual". "I was going to call it the Hungry Intellectual, but I ran out of paint" for the sign, Nord would tell interviewers. In another story, the sign was not finished in time for the club's opening, and next-day reviews in the San Francisco papers cemented the name for all time. Banducci swore that it was
Freudian
and was short for "the hungry
id
".
[5]
Club
[
edit
]
The Hungry I was founded in 1949 or 1950 as an 83-seat venue in the
Sentinel Building
's basement at the corner of
Kearny
and Columbus, by Eric Nord, who sold it to Banducci in 1951.
[1]
After operating it as a venue for folk singers including
Stan Wilson
, Banducci began hiring comedians in 1953 with
Mort Sahl
, encouraging them to express themselves freely.
[1]
Their success caused queues around the block, until Banducci moved the Hungry I to the nearby
International Hotel
(nicknamed "the I-Hotel") at 599 Jackson Street in 1954.
[6]
[1]
The Hungry I and Banducci were instrumental in the careers of
Mort Sahl
, who was the pioneer of a new style of stand-up comedy, comic
Bill Cosby
, comic
Lenny Bruce
, and minister
Malcolm Boyd
.
The Kingston Trio
recorded two noted albums at the Hungry I,
[7]
including the first live performance of their version of "
The Lion Sleeps Tonight
".
Tom Lehrer
's final satirical album
That Was the Year That Was
(1965) was also recorded there, as well as
The Limeliters
' album
Our Men in San Francisco
(1963).
Jazz pianist
Vince Guaraldi
,
[6]
folk singer
Glenn Yarborough
, the
Gateway Singers
, and comedians
Godfrey Cambridge
, Professor
Irwin Corey
,
Joan Rivers
and
Mort Sahl
were also given career boosts from their appearances at the Hungry I, as well as
Dick Cavett
and
Woody Allen
. The
folk-rock
group
We Five
were signed to
A&M records
after
Herb Alpert
saw them perform there.
John Phillips
and his group
The Journeymen
were the house band in the early 1960s.
The young
Barbra Streisand
begged Banducci for a single night at his nightclub, insisting that she would soon be a huge star. Banducci agreed to sign the singer, who had never performed professionally but was soon starring in
I Can Get It for You Wholesale
on Broadway. The resulting concerts (March-April 1963) were well-attended, giving Streisand nationwide acclaim.
[8]
On 16 January 1967,
Laura Nyro
started her debut live performances at the Hungry I.
[9]
Later in the same year,
Ike & Tina Turner
performed at the club and a photograph of
Tina Turner
by
Baron Wolman
was used for the cover of the second issue of
Rolling Stone
magazine.
[10]
The comedy and folk music scene wilted in the mid-1960s. On 12 October 1967 Banducci closed the club at its International Hotel location and moved to
Ghirardelli Square
; it was mainly a rock music venue, and closed in 1970.
[6]
Banducci and many of the club's performers, including Mort Sahl,
Jonathan Winters
, Irwin Corey,
Jackie Vernon
, and many others, reunited in 1981 for a one-night performance, which also featured film of the late Lenny Bruce.  The event was captured for the nationally televised documentary
Hungry I Reunion
, produced and directed by Thomas A. Cohen and featuring reminiscences by Bill Cosby, as well as by
Maya Angelou
, who had frequently performed there in the guise of a Caribbean singer at the beginning of her career.
Strip club
[
edit
]
The then-current strip club at 546 Broadway (2017)
In the late 1960s, clubs along the
Broadway strip
began to transform into fully nude
strip clubs
run by  a consortium of club owners. As the Hungry I was shutting down in its final location at Ghirardelli Square, Banducci sold the rights to its name and logo to this consortium. One of the clubs, Pierre's at 546 Broadway, was promptly renamed "Hungry I Club" and continued to operate as a strip club under various owners,
[11]
until 2019.
Exhibition
[
edit
]
An exhibition on the history of the Hungry I opened March 28, 2007 at the San Francisco Performing Arts Library, now the
Museum of Performance & Design
, and was on view through August 25, 2007. Alumni who performed at the Hungry I during its heyday—as well as club owner Enrico Banducci and his daughter—gathered for an opening celebration March 27.  Among those reminiscing about their appearances at the club were
Orson Bean
,
Shelley Berman
, Father
Malcolm Boyd
,
Travis Edmonson
,
Tom Lehrer
,
The Kingston Trio
,
Mort Sahl
,
Ronnie Schell
, and
Glenn Yarborough
.
[12]
Radio
[
edit
]
The San Francisco radio station KGO broadcast several talk shows live before an audience from the Hungry I in the 1950s and 60s, notably hosted by
Les Crane
and
Ira Blue
.
Mort Sahl
was KGO's overnight announcer in the 1950s.

Simeon in the Temple
, by
Rembrandt van Rijn
, 1631
Simeon
(
Greek
:
Συμεών
) at the
Temple
is the "just and devout" man of
Jerusalem
who, according to
Luke 2:25-35
, met
Mary
,
Joseph
, and
Jesus
as they entered the
Temple
to fulfill the
requirements of the Law of Moses
on the 40th day from Jesus' birth, i. e. the
presentation of Jesus at the Temple
.
According to the Biblical account, the
Holy Spirit
visited Simeon and revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Christ of God. Upon taking Jesus into his arms, he uttered a prayer which is still used
liturgically
as the Latin
Nunc dimittis
in the
Catholic Church
and other Christian churches, and gave a prophecy alluding to the
Crucifixion of Jesus
.
Some Christian traditions commemorate this meeting on 2 February as the feast of
Candlemas
, or, more formally, the Presentation of the Lord, the Meeting of the Lord, or the Purification of the Virgin (Mary). His prophecy is involved in the devotion to
Mary
as
Our Lady of Sorrows
. Simeon is venerated as a
saint
in the
Catholic Church
,
Lutheran Church
,
Anglican Communion
,
Eastern Orthodoxy
and
Oriental Orthodoxy
. His
feast
is 3 February in the revised
Roman Martyrology
of the Catholic Church and on 16 February (Julian Calendar) in the
Serbian Orthodox Church
.

New Testament
[

Main article:
Presentation of Jesus at the Temple
The sole mention in the New Testament of Simeon is thus:
Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, "Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel." And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed." -
,
RSV-2CE
Some writers have identified this Simeon with
Shimon ben Hillel
, although Hillel was not a priest.
[2]
James F. Driscoll, writing in the
Catholic Encyclopedia
dismisses this as "untrustworthy legends".

Title

Simeon senex
(Simeon the old man) occurs in some Latin texts and
hagiographies
.
[4]
Aged Simeon
in poetry and music, including the
Candlemas
anthem "When Mary to the Temple Went" by
Johannes Eccard
(1533-1611).
"Simeon" is used by Protestants.
[5]
Simeon Theodochos
(Simeon the God-Receiver, Συμεών ο Θεοδόχος) is used in
Greek Orthodoxy
. The Russian Orthodox tradition uses
Simeon Bogo-Priimets
(Симеон Богоприимец).
Age
[
edit
]
The Bible is silent about Simeon's age at this point, though he is generally assumed (for example by Howard Marshall, who refers to him as an "old man")
[6]
to have been elderly.
Orthodox tradition says that he was one of the seventy scholars who translated the Hebrew Scriptures into the Septuagint, and that he translated Isaiah 7:14 as saying "a young woman" would conceive rather than "a virgin" due to his disbelief. Because of this, a divine being told him he would live to see the fulfillment of this prophecy. When he was around 360 years old, he saw Jesus, uttered the benediction and died.

Relics
[
edit
]
St. Simeon Monastery, Katamon, Jerusalem
Sometime between AD 565 and 578, a body believed to be that of Simeon was translated from Syria or Jerusalem to
Constantinople
.
[9]
Sometime around the
Siege of Constantinople (1203)
the relics were seized and shipped to
Venice
; however, a storm forced the ship to put in to the port of
Zadar
on the Dalmatian coast. The relics were first placed in the
Velika Gospa
(Church of the Virgin) and then later translated to the Church of St. Stephen, which became known as the Sanctuary of St. Simeon the Godbearer. Simeon is one of the four patron saints of
Zadar
; his feast day is celebrated on 8 October. In October 2010,
Archbishop
Želimir Puljić
of Zadar conveyed a small silver reliquary containing some of Simeon's relics to Archbishop Theofylactus of
Jordan
, representing
Theophilos III
, the
Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem
, for the monastery of St. Simeon the Godbearer in
Jerusalem
.

Festal observances
[

The Meeting of Our Lord
(Russian icon, 15th century)
The events in the life of Simeon the Righteous are observed on both 2 and 3 February.
[

]
The observances of the first day memorialize the act of
Mary
undergoing an act of ritual purification and presenting Jesus, her child, to the Temple, a
feast
known as the
Presentation of Jesus at the Temple
. Because this day focuses on Jesus and Mary, the observation of 3 February is specific to Simeon, who was allowed to die after seeing the
Christ
born of a virgin.
Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary
[
edit
]
Under
Mosaic law
, a mother who had given birth to a man-child was considered unclean for seven days; moreover she was to remain for three and 30 days "in the blood of her purification", for a total of 40 days. The Christian
Feast of the Purification
therefore corresponds to the day on which Mary, according to
Jewish law
(see
), should have attended a ceremony of ritual purification. The
Gospel of Luke
2:22-39
relates that Mary was purified according to the religious law, after which Jesus was presented in the Temple in
Jerusalem
. This explains the formal names of the feast.
In the
liturgy
of
Evening Prayer
in the
Anglican Communion
, Anglicans recite the
Nunc dimittis
or sing it in Evensong in the canticle the Song of Simeon, traditionally every evening. The liturgical hour of
Compline
of the
Catholic Church
and of
Vespers
in Orthodoxy also use it. Many notable composers have set the
Nunc dimittis
to music, e. g. the (
All-Night Vigil
of
Rachmaninoff
).
The feast of 2 February is often known as "
Candlemas
" because, in honor of the ritual purification of the Virgin Mary,
candles
of
beeswax
, which will be used for the whole liturgical year, are brought into a church and blessed. In the
Catholic Church
the Presentation is commemorated as the fourth Joyful Mystery of the
Rosary
. In the
Church of England
the Presentation of Christ in the Temple is a
principal feast
. In the
Eastern Orthodox Church
it is one of the twelve
Great Feasts
.

3 February
[
edit
]
Simeon the Righteous is commemorated in his own right on 3 February. In the
Anglican Communion
Simeon is not venerated with a festal observance, and 3 February is designated to recognize
Blaise
, Bishop of Sebastea, or in modern calendars,
Saint Anskar
(801-865), a missionary,
Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen
, and the first Bishop in
Sweden
in 864.
In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, Simeon is commemorated with
Anna the Prophetess
on 3 February on the
Feast of the Holy and Righteous Simeon the God-Receiver and Anna the Prophetess
.
16 February
[
edit
]
While both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches agree on the date of
Candlemas
as the 40th day after
Christmas
, in accordance with the
Mosaic Law
, the difference in the marking of Christmas on 25 December resulted from a theological dispute on the replacement by the
Gregorian Calendar
of the older
Julian Calendar
. 25 December currently occurs 13 days later on the Julian Calendar than on the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian revision of the calendar occurred in 1582, well after the
Great Schism
between the Eastern and Western Christian churches in 1054. Consequently, many Orthodox Christians celebrate the feast of Saint Simeon on 16 February. As mentioned above, the
Eastern Orthodox Church
celebrates Saint Simeon on the day after the Feast of the Presentation, i. e. 3 February. However, for those churches that use the
Julian Calendar
, 3 February is on 16 February of the modern
Gregorian Calendar
.
[

The
Armenian Apostolic Church
celebrates the Nativity of Christ on 6 January, and so its celebration of the Presentation, which its denominates
The Coming of the Son of God into the Temple
, is on 14 February.
On 1 December occurs commemoration of his,
James
and
Zacharias
relics translation in 351, and 25 May is commemoration of their relics discover also in 351.

George Acworth (disambiguation)
.
George Acworth
(1534-1578?) was an
English
protestant
divine
and civil lawyer of the 16th century.
Acworth was educated at
Peterhouse, Cambridge
.
[1]
During the reign of
Queen Mary
, he travelled in
France
and
Italy
, where he studied
civil law
. In 1560, he was public orator at Cambridge; and, in the following year, was created
doctor of laws
.
In 1562, he was admitted as an advocate in the
Arches Court
; and afterwards lived in the family of archbishop
Parker
, who gave him a
prebend
of North Muskham in
Southwell
. In 1567, he was vicar-general to
Robert Horne
,
bishop of Winchester
; and, in 1575, the archbishop of Canterbury permitted him to hold the rectory of Ellington, alias
Wroughton
, in the
Diocese of Sarum
, with any
benefice
.
In 1576, he was appointed
master of the faculties
, and judge of the prerogative court, in
Ireland
, after he had been turned out of all the situations he held in England, because of his dissolute conduct. The date of his death is uncertain.
Acworth wrote:
Orationem encomiasticam in restitutione Buceri et Fagii,
printed in
Hist. Buceri
, Argentor, 1562 (re Martin Bucer & Paul Fagius); the preface to Book II of
Bucer
's works, fol. Basil, 1577;
De visibili Romanarchia, contra Nic. Sanderi Monarchiam,
London, 1622. This was written while he lived with archbishop
Parker
, and probably at his instigation; Nicolas Sanderus had written
Monarchia
. At one time, he enjoyed the confidence of archbishop Parker, and assisted him in his
Antiquitates Britannicae
.

The fortepiano
dynamic
as it appears in modern music
The expression
fortepiano
(sometimes called
forte piano
) is a sudden
dynamic
change used in a
musical score
, usually with the abbreviation
fp
, to designate a section of music in which the music should be played loudly (
forte
), then immediately softly (
piano
).
[1]
It is not unusual for it to be followed by a crescendo, a gradual increase in dynamics.

The word is of
Italian
etymology literally translated as 'loudsoft'.

List of episodes
"
Shareholder Meeting
" is the eleventh episode of the
sixth season
of the American comedy television series
The Office
and the show's 111th episode overall. Written by
Justin Spitzer
and directed by
Charles McDougall
, it originally aired on
NBC
on November 19, 2009.
The series, presented in a
mockumentary
style, depicts the everyday lives of office employees at the
Scranton, Pennsylvania
branch of the fictional
Dunder Mufflin
Paper Company. In this episode,
Michael Scott
(
Steve Carell
) is invited to attend a
shareholder meeting
in New York City, and is shocked to learn the shareholders are upset with the company's management. In Scranton,
Jim Halpert
(
John Krasinski
) struggles to keep order in Michael's absence, as his coworkers refuse to see him as their co-manager. The episode
achieved a viewership
of 7.39 during its initial airing in the United States.
[1]
Plot
[
edit
]
Michael Scott
(
Steve Carell
) is excited when he is invited by CEO Alan Brand (
Alan Fudge
) to be honored on stage at the
Dunder Mifflin
shareholder meeting in New York City. He brings
Andy Bernard
(
Ed Helms
),
Dwight Schrute
(
Rainn Wilson
), and
Oscar Martinez
(
Oscar Nunez
) along for the ride in the limo that was sent. Oscar is upset that the company spent money on a limo when they are about to go bankrupt, and is further upset that they booked a huge conference room for the meeting. Andy suggests that Oscar bring up these grievances at the meeting, but Oscar refuses out of fear for losing his job. Dwight decides to stand in the line for the microphones so he can ask Michael a simple question to warm up, but gets stuck in the middle of a huge line when he attempts to move to a shorter one. When the meeting begins, the panel is met with jeers, which Michael did not expect. When the panel moves to take a break, the crowd's jeers increase as they protest that the panel has yet to offer any solutions to Dunder Mifflin's situation. Michael impulsively announces a 45-day plan to fix Dunder Mifflin, which is greeted with enthusiastic applause.
Jim Halpert
(
John Krasinski
) has a hard time getting
Ryan Howard
(
B. J. Novak
) to do work, as Ryan sees no point since the company is on the verge of closing. Later
Phyllis Vance
(
Phyllis Smith
) decides to take a two-hour lunch break, where she gets drunk, and when Jim tries to stop her, she bluntly tells him that Michael always lets her take two-hour lunch breaks and that she does not have to listen to Jim since he cannot fire her. The rest of the office backs up Phyllis's assessment, and it becomes apparent that Ryan sent an email around the office regarding Jim's lack of authority over the office. Jim thinks that he needs to make an example of Ryan in front of everyone, but
Pam Halpert
(
Jenna Fischer
) does not think Jim is capable of doing so. Jim, after giving Ryan one last chance to do his work, gives him his own personal office space in the small closet in the kitchen, which lacks windows and possibly internet access so he will not bother anyone or become distracted. He presents this "honor" to Ryan in front of everyone, showing them he means business. A humiliated Ryan tries to apologize, but Jim puts him in the closet anyway.
In New York, a frustrated
David Wallace
(
Andy Buckley
) reveals to Michael that Dunder Mifflin's corporate leaders have no plan to get the company back on track. Michael is astounded by this but remains positive and calls Oscar into the hotel room for some suggestions. However, Oscar is visibly embarrassed and unwilling to criticize the management to their faces. Oscar instead compliments them, not repeating any of his earlier suggestions, and leaves. Michael follows and rebukes Oscar for backing down, but Oscar still refuses to help him. When Michael returns, he is further lambasted by the CEO and former U.S. Congressman Chris O'Keefe, who openly insults Michael. In his defense, Michael points out that he is the only person who seems to be making money for Dunder Mifflin and the only one offering any positive suggestions or plans, going so far as to return the former Congressman's insult. Enraged, O'Keefe, who is presiding over the meeting, takes away Michael's limo privileges. Michael then triumphantly sneaks away — with Dwight, Andy, and Oscar — back out into their limo and drives out of the city. As they leave, Michael justifies his actions by saying that of everyone there, he and his team are the only ones who deserve to celebrate with limo rides. As they leave, the camera catches a glance at the stock market ticker, where the Dunder Mifflin (DMI) stock price, currently at $1.13, down 6 7/8, continues to drop dramatically. An ending scene reveals that, when Dwight reached the end of the line, he complained that the state of the line is indicative of the company's poor management. However, he only offers suggestions about how to improve the line, swiftly ending his turn.
Production
[
edit
]
New York outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed in California. Two taxi cabs along with Michael's limo, using New York plates, were shot in front of a California intersection with a
Roman Revival
style building in the background for a New York effect. The building has both a California state flag and US flag hanging over its entrance.
The cold opening for the episode deals with Dwight and his fictional
Earth Day
super hero "Recyclops". During Jim's narrative, he discusses the history of Recyclops, and a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown. The receptionists that Dwight harasses include: Pam, who is accompanied by Jim, circa 2006; Ryan; Ronni (
Dale Raoul
), who was introduced during the
fifth season
episode "
Weight Loss
"; and Erin. These clips were created to look as if they had been filmed in the past and were only then being used.
[2]
This was not the only time this technique was used in the series. During the
seventh season
episode "
Threat Level Midnight
", there is a short sequence that was shot to look as if it had been filmed during the show's second season, although the scene itself was filmed in 2011.
[3]
Furthermore, during the
season nine
episode "
Customer Loyalty
", the cold opening features a montage of Jim setting up a prank—which involves sending Dwight on a quest for the
Holy Grail
that heavily suggested that Jim set up the prank sometime during 2006, which would have taken place during the show's
second season
.
[4]
Appropriately, the montage was filmed to look as if the documentarians were using archival footage of Jim; his hair matches the style that Jim had during the first few seasons of the show.
[4]
[5]
Reception
[
edit
]
This episode was watched by 7.39 million viewers, with a 3.7 rating and a 10 share in the 18-49 demographic.
[6]
"Shareholder Meeting" received positive reviews. Dan Phillips of
IGN
called the episode "funny from beginning to end", particularly praising the scenes between Michael and the board. Phillips also enjoyed the subplot between Jim and Ryan, stating that it "carried its fair share of comedic weight".
[7]
Michael's announcement that Dunder Mifflin would be going "carbon neutral" was a tie-in with NBC's "Green Week".

[1]
(born 24 February 1951) is a British
computer scientist
. He is a Professor in the
Department of Computer Science
at the
University of Bristol
and founder of
XMOS Semiconductor
, serving until February 2014 as the
chief technology officer
.
[2]
May was
lead architect
for the
transputer
. As of 2017, he holds 56 patents, all in
microprocessors
and
multi-processing
.
Life and career
[
edit
]
May was born in
Holmfirth
, Yorkshire, England and attended
Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield
. From 1969 to 1972 he was a student at
King's College, Cambridge
,
University of Cambridge
, at first studying Mathematics and then Computer Science in the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory, now the
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
.
He moved to the
University of Warwick
and started research in
robotics
. The challenges of implementing sensing and control systems led him to design and implement an early
concurrent programming language
, EPL, which ran on a cluster of
single-board
microcomputers
connected by
serial communication
links. This early work brought him into contact with
Tony Hoare
and
Iann Barron
: one of the founders of
Inmos
.
When
Inmos
was formed in 1978, May joined to work on microcomputer architecture, becoming lead architect of the transputer and designer of the associated programming language
Occam
. This extended his earlier work and was also influenced by
Tony Hoare
, who was at the time working on
CSP
and acting as a consultant to Inmos.
The prototype of the transputer was called the
Simple 42
and was completed in 1982. The first production transputers, the
T212
and
T414
, followed in 1985; the
T800
floating point transputer in 1987. May initiated the design of one of the first
VLSI
packet switches
, the
C104
, together with the communications system of the
T9000
transputer.
Working closely with
Tony Hoare
and the
Programming Research Group
at
Oxford University
, May introduced formal verification techniques into the design of the
T800
floating point unit
and the
T9000
transputer. These were some of the earliest uses of
formal verification
in microprocessor design, involving specifications,
correctness preserving transformations
and
model checking
, giving rise to the initial version of the FDR checker developed at Oxford.
In 1995, May joined the
University of Bristol
as a professor of computer science. He was head of the computer science department from 1995 to 2006. He continues to be a professor at
Bristol
while supporting
XMOS
, a University spin-out he co-founded in 2005.  Before XMOS, he was involved in
Picochip
, where he wrote the original instruction set.
May is married with three sons and lives in
Bristol
, United Kingdom.
Awards and recognition
[
edit
]
In 1990, May received an
Honorary DSc
from the
University of Southampton
, followed in 1991 by his election as a Fellow of
The Royal Society
and the
Clifford Paterson Medal and Prize
of the
Institute of Physics
in 1992.
In 2010, he was elected a
Fellow
[3]
of the
Royal Academy of Engineering
.

The
Spanish conquest of Petén
was the last stage of the
conquest of Guatemala
, a prolonged conflict during the
Spanish colonisation of the Americas
. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin with a series of lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low
karstic
hills and rises to the south as it nears the
Guatemalan Highlands
. The conquest of
Petén
, a region now incorporated into the modern republic of
Guatemala
, climaxed in 1697 with the capture of
Nojpetén
, the island capital of the
Itza
kingdom, by
Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi
. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the
Americas
fell to European colonisers.
Sizeable
Maya
populations existed in Petén before the conquest, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Petén was divided into different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the
Yalain
and the
Kowoj
. Other groups with territories in Petén included the
Kejache
, the
Acala
, the
Lakandon Chʼol
, the Xocmo, the
Chinamita
, the Icaiche and the
Manche Chʼol
.
Petén was first penetrated by
Hernán Cortés
with a sizeable expedition that crossed the territory from north to south in 1525. In the first half of the 16th century, Spain established neighbouring colonies in
Yucatán
to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries laid the groundwork for the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Petén from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Petén took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of
Mérida
in Yucatán.
In 1622 a military expedition set out from Yucatán led by Captain Francisco de Mirones and accompanied by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado; this expedition was a disaster, and the Spanish were massacred by the Itza. In 1628 the Manche Chʼol of the south were placed under the administration of the colonial governor of Verapaz within the
Captaincy General of Guatemala
. The Manche Chʼol unsuccessfully rebelled against Spanish control in 1633. In 1695 a military expedition tried to reach Lake Petén Itzá from Guatemala; this was followed in 1696 by missionaries from Mérida and in 1697 by Martín de Ursúa's expedition from Yucatán that resulted in the final defeat of the independent kingdoms of central Petén and their incorporation into the
Spanish Empire
.

Geography of Guatemala
Petén savannah
The modern
department
of
Petén
is located in northern Guatemala. It is bordered on the west by the Mexican state of
Chiapas
; this border largely follows the course of the
Usumacinta River
. On the north side Petén is bordered by the Mexican state of
Campeche
and on the northwest by the Mexican state of
Tabasco
; Petén is bordered on the east by
Belize
[1]
and on the south side by the Guatemalan departments of
Alta Verapaz
and
Izabal
.
[2]
The Petén lowlands are formed by a densely forested low-lying
limestone
plain featuring
karstic
topography.
[3]
The area is crossed by low east-west oriented ridges of
Cenozoic
limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as
bajos
.
[4]
A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the
central drainage basin
of Petén; during the
rainy season
some of these lakes become interconnected. This
drainage area
measures approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) east-west by 30 kilometres (19 mi) north-south.
[5]
The largest lake is
Lake Petén Itzá
, near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures 32 by 5 kilometres (19.9 by 3.1 mi). A broad
savannah
extends south of the central lakes; it has an average altitude of 150 metres (490 ft)
above mean sea level
with karstic ridges reaching an average altitude of 300 metres (980 ft). The savannah features a compact red clay soil that is too poor to support heavy cultivation, which resulted in a relatively low level of
pre-Columbian
occupation. It is surrounded by hills with unusually steep southern slopes and gentler northern approaches; the hills are covered with dense tropical forest. To the north of the lakes region
bajos
become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of Petén the
Mirador Basin
forms another interior drainage region.
[6]
To the south Petén reaches an altitude of approximately 500 metres (1,600 ft) as it rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets
Paleozoic
metamorphic rocks.
[7]
Climate
[
edit
]
The climate of Petén is divided into
wet
and
dry seasons
, with the rainy season lasting from June to December,
[8]
although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south.
[9]
The climate varies from
tropical
in the south to
semitropical
in the north; temperature varies between 12 and 40 °C (54 and 104 °F), although it does not usually drop beneath 18 °C (64 °F).
[8]
Mean temperature varies from 24.3 °C (75.7 °F) in the southeast around
Poptún
to 26.9 °C (80.4 °F) around
Uaxactún
in the northeast. Highest temperatures are reached from April to June, and January is the coldest month; all Petén experiences a hot dry period in late August. Annual precipitation is high, varying from a mean of 1,198 millimetres (47.2 in) in the northeast to 2,007 millimetres (79.0 in) in central Petén around
Flores
(Nojpetén). The extreme southeast of Petén experiences the largest variations in temperature and rainfall, with precipitation reaching as much as 3,000 millimetres (120 in) in a year.
[9]
Petén before the conquest
[
edit
]
The first large
Maya cities
developed in Petén as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 600-350 BC),
[10]
and Petén formed the heartland of the ancient
Maya civilization
during the
Classic period
(c. AD 250-900).
[11]
The great cities that dominated Petén had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the
Classic Maya collapse
.
[12]
A significant Maya presence remained into the
Postclassic period
after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.
[13]
Map of the northern lowlands of Guatemala at the time of Spanish contact
Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers.
[14]
Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon
Lake Petén Itzá
; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala.
[15]
The Itza spoke a variety of
Yucatecan Maya
.
[16]
The
Kowoj
were the second in importance, and they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché,
Lake Yaxhá
and Lake Sacnab.
[17]
Other groups are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the
Chinamita
, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon
Chʼol
, the
Mopan
, the
Manche Chʼol
and the
Yalain
.
[18]
The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Petén, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj in Belize.
[19]
In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of
Lake Macanché
.
[20]
At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups.
[19]
In the late 17th century Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including
Zacpeten
on Lake Macanché and
Ixlu
on
Lake Salpetén
.
[21]
The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of them was
Acalan
, inhabited by a
Chontal Maya
-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The
Chʼolan Maya
-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas.
[15]
The Lakandon had a fierce reputation among the Spanish.
[22]
The Xocmo were another Chʼolan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lakandon.
[15]
Never conquered, the Xocmo escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them and their eventual fate is unknown; they may be ancestors of the modern
Lacandon people
.
[23]
The Manche Chʼol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Petén department.
[15]
The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Petén.
[24]
The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.
[25]
Background to the conquest
[
edit
]
Main article:
Spanish colonization of the Americas
Christopher Columbus
discovered the Americas for the
Kingdom of Castile and León
in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule.
[26]
In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the
Caribbean
and established a centre of operations on the island of
Cuba
. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the
Aztecs
on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast.
[27]
By August 1521 the Aztec capital of
Tenochtitlan
had fallen to the Spanish.
[28]
Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec
. The newly conquered territory became
New Spain
, headed by a
viceroy
who answered to the Spanish Crown via the
Council of the Indies
.
[29]
Cortés despatched
Pedro de Alvarado
with an army to conquer the
Mesoamerican
kingdoms of the Guatemalan
Sierra Madre
and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541.
[30]
The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at
Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala
and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as
El Salvador
,
Honduras
and
Costa Rica
.
[31]
The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between - essentially Petén and much of Belize - independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.
[32]
Impact of Old World diseases
[
edit
]
Illustration depicting smallpox victims in the 16th century
Florentine Codex
A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying
smallpox
and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.
[33]
The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of Petén. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Chʼol and
Chʼoltiʼ
Maya in western Petén at the start of the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.
[34]
When Nojpetén fell in 1697 there were approximately 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a considerable number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of the inhabitants died during the first decade of colonial rule because of disease and war.
[35]
Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, internecine warfare between rival Maya groups and Spanish expeditions also took their toll.
[36]
Weaponry and armour
[
edit
]
17th-century Spanish cannon
17th-century French musket
Conquistadors often wore steel armour that included chainmail and helmets.
[37]
The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the
quilted cotton armour
of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour.
[38]
Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour.
[39]
After the final push to the Petén lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made
muskets
, three 1-pound (0.45 kg) calibre light
cannons
(
piezas
) cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze
pedreros
(2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as
esmiriles
).
[40]
Native weaponry
[
edit
]
... The two [Itza] Captains bore their Lances with points of Flint, like ours, which differ from them only in being of Steel, and at the heads of them are many Plumes of divers and beautiful colors like the Ribbons our Standard-bearers use on their darts; and the points are as much as a quarter of a
vara
long and have two cutting-edges, and the point is like a very sharp Dagger.
The other Itzaex Indians bore their Bows and Arrows with which they always march when they come forth from their Island ... in case they meet the Chinamitas, a Nation for whom they have always had enmity, and continual wars; for they hold themselves as brave warriors like the Itzas themselves.
[41]
—
Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor, 1701
Book II, Chapter II, p. 92.
The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows,
fire-sharpened
poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as
hadzab
that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset
obsidian
;
[42]
these were similar to the Aztec
macuahuitl
. They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to 80 centimetres (31 in) long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree (
Apoplanesia
paniculata
) called
chulul
by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were described as almost as high as a man and were made from the same
chulul
wood as the
hadzab
, with the bowstring fashioned from
henequen
fibre; the bow was called a
chuhul
.
[43]
Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers.
[44]
In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a
chulul
-wood handle, they were about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long. Maya spears were referred to as
nabte
; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were a similar size as those used by the Spanish.
[45]
Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The upper body was covered by a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were protected with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.
[46]
Strategies and tactics
[
edit
]
The Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their
trade routes
over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the Spanish advance.
[47]
The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or
reducciones
(also known as
congregaciones
).
[48]
Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish.
[49]
Those that remained behind in the
reducciones
often fell victim to contagious diseases.
[50]
In addition to military expeditions, a contract for conquest was issued to the
Dominican Order
, which engaged missionaries for the peaceful pacification of native populations so they would accept Roman Catholicism and submit to Spanish rule. This tactic worked in the neighbouring mountains of Verapaz to the south, although their success there was aided by the threat of Spanish garrisons stationed within striking distance. In the lowland Petén this approach was not so successful, since the Maya could disappear easily into the rainforest leaving the Spanish with deserted settlements.
[26]
Likewise, the
Franciscan Order
engaged in generally peaceful attempts to incorporate the Maya into the Spanish Empire via the attempted Christian conversion of native leaders.
[51]
The Franciscan Order routinely embraced the practice of missionary violence, including
corporal punishment
and the defence of the idea of "
holy war
" against non-Christians.
[52]
In many cases the Maya remained Christian only while the missionaries were present, and they would immediately become
apostate
as soon as the friars left.
[50]
In Guatemala in the late 17th century, the Franciscan friar Francisco de Asís Vázquez de Herrera argued that war against apostate Indians was obligatory.
[52]
Missionary penetration of Petén was not risk-free, and many missionaries were killed in the region.
[50]
Independent Maya frequently attacked Christianised Maya settlements and encouraged such settlements to abandon their new religion and resist the Spanish.
[50]
As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict.
[53]
The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment;
[19]
they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire.
[54]
With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.
[55]
Cortés in Petén
[
edit
]
Hernán Cortés, conqueror of the Aztecs, travelled across Petén in the early 16th century.
In 1525, after the
Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire
, Hernán Cortés led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Petén Department of Guatemala.
[56]
His aim was to subdue the rebellious
Cristóbal de Olid
, whom he had sent to
conquer Honduras
; Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory.
[57]
Cortés had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him 600
Chontal Maya
carriers from Acalan. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525.
[58]
The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of
Aj Kan Ekʼ
, the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols.
[59]
Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ekʼ to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.
[60]
On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died.
[61]
The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of
Franciscan
priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén.
[56]
From the lake, Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the
Maya Mountains
, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover 32 kilometres (20 mi), during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.
[59]
On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of
Lake Izabal
, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety.
[59]
Cortés found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the
Dulce River
to the settlement of
Nito
, somewhere on the
Amatique Bay
,
[62]
with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week.
[59]
By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.
[63]
Prelude to conquest
[
edit
]
From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucatán Peninsula, establishing several colonies and towns by 1544, including
Campeche
and
Valladolid
in what is now Mexico.
[64]
The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Petén Itzá, within the modern borders of Guatemala.
[65]
Dominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century, the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the
encomienda
system.

The first Catholic missionaries entered southern Petén in 1596 to convert the Manche Chʼol and the Mopan.
[54]
The
Qʼeqchiʼ
of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche Chʼol.
[66]
The colonial Maya towns of
Cobán
and
Cahabón
, in Alta Verapaz, traded
quetzal
feathers,
copal
, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and Manche Chʼol neighbours, receiving
cacao
and
achiote
in exchange.
[67]
Many Qʼeqchiʼ from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakandón and Manche Chʼol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Chʼol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz;
[68]
the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Petén led to religious
syncretism
that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent.
[69]
This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Qʼeqchiʼ to help conquer and reduce the Manche Chʼol.
[66]
From the middle of the 16th century the Dominican Order had been tasked with the peaceful conversion of the Chʼol of Verapaz and southern Petén, and their concentration into new colonial towns.
[70]
The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Chʼol would lead the Spanish to Nojpetén.
[54]
In 1628 the towns of the Manche Chʼol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head.
[71]
Morán favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north.
[72]
The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.
[72]
The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a Manche rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.
[54]
Towards the end of the 17th century Spanish priorities changed, and the failure of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the Chʼol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region;
[73]
military options were also viewed more favourably.
[74]
Between 1685 and 1689, the Qʼeqchiʼ of Cobán and Cahabón were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the Manche Chʼol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern Petén and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of Petén.
[75]
From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars
Antonio Margil
and Melchor López were active among the Manche and Lakandon Chʼol. They were eventually expelled by the Chʼol;
[76]
upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern Petén and neighbouring Chiapas.
[77]
Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to
Rabinal
in the modern department of
Baja Verapaz
. After 1700 the Manche Chʼol ceased to play any part in the history of Petén.
[54]
The Mopan population has been estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people at the time of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies ordered that the Manche Chʼol and the Mopan be dealt with decisively. The population suffered the effects of war and disease, and the few survivors were moved into Spanish
reducciones
in southeastern Petén, before being moved to colonial settlements in other parts of Petén.
[54]
In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and soldiers commanded by
Jacinto de Barrios Leal
, president of the
Royal Audiencia of Guatemala
,
[78]
conquered several Chʼol communities.
[79]
The most important of these was Sakbʼajlan on the
Lacantún River
in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695.
[80]
This was one part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Petén and neighbouring Chiapas; a second group joined up with Barrios Leal having marched from
Huehuetenango
. The third group, under Juan Díaz de Velasco, marched from Verapaz against the Itza.
[22]
Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops.
[81]
The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers.
Mercederian
friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Chʼols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Chʼol communities.
[82]
Resistance against the Spanish continued, and hostile Chʼol killed several newly baptised Christian Indians.
[81]
In early March 1696 such was the success of the friars that captain Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians decided to try to reach Lake Petén Itzá. They headed eastwards towards the
Pasión River
with 150 heavily armed soldiers plus native guides, travelling in five large canoes. They got as far as the savannah to the southeast of the lake before turning back for unknown reasons.
[83]
Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697.
[81]
The Chʼol of the
Lacandon Jungle
were resettled in
Huehuetenango
in the early 18th century.
[84]
Conquest of the central lakes
[
edit
]
Lake Yaxha is surrounded by dense forest.
Nojpetén fell to a Spanish assault on 13 March 1697, more than 150 years after the conquest of the rest of the
Yucatán Peninsula
and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands.
[85]
The lengthy delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a combination of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants.
[86]
During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize.
[19]
The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and
Incas
. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by
Satan
from the Christianising efforts of the
Spanish Empire
and the
Roman Catholic Church
.
[87]
From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the
Aj Kan Ek'
) was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.
[20]
Early 17th century
[
edit
]
17th-century European pikeman
Following Cortés' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida in Yucatán on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya.
[88]
Andrés Carrillo de Pernía, a
Criollo
who was the
alcalde
of
Bacalar
(a colonial official),
[nb 1]
joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there.
[90]
After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ekʼ. They stayed at Nojpetén for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ekʼ refused to renounce his
Maya religion
, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ekʼ informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since Cortés had visited Nojpetén, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ekʼ.
[88]
The friars returned in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ekʼ welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the
Maya priesthood
were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return.
[88]
Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.
[91]
Before the early 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily populated by Chʼol and Chʼoltiʼ Maya and was an important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza.
[34]
At the same time the Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.
[92]
Spanish setbacks in the 1620s
[
edit
]
In March 1622, governor of Yucatán
Diego de Cardenas
ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán.
[93]
His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado.
[91]
The expedition first camped at IxPimienta;
[nb 2]
in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements.
[95]
En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from
Tipuj
in Belize.
[91]
In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts.
[96]
When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén.
[97]
From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ekʼ, asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital,
[98]
but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals.
[99]
The soldiers were
sacrificed
to the
Maya gods
, with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town.
[100]
After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others.
[101]
The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.
[99]
Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjKʼin Pʼol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum
[102]
and slaughtered them.
[91]
Spanish reinforcements led by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived too late;
[103]
the Spanish soldiers had been sacrificed, hanged and beheaded, with their corpses burned and impaled on stakes at the entrance to the village; Mirones and the Franciscan priest had been bound to the church posts and then sacrificed with their hearts cut out.
[104]
A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.
[103]
Following these massacres, Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucatán, and rewards were offered for the whereabouts of AjKʼin Pʼol. The Maya governor of
Oxkutzcab
, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be
hanged, drawn and quartered
. They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial
Partido de la Sierra
in what is now Mexico's Yucatán state.
[105]
These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695.
[91]
In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.
[106]
Late 17th century

What matters it that the time has come when we are to become Christians, if this slender point of my flint lance has not been worn out?
—
Words of Aj Kowoj to Andrés de Avendaño
[107]
In 1692
Basque
nobleman Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from Mérida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony, in the process "reducing" any independent native populations into colonial
congregaciones
; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon and Manche Chʼol of southern Petén and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River. The original plan was for the province of Yucatán to build the northern section and for Guatemala to build the southern portion, with both meeting somewhere in Chʼol territory; the plan was later modified to pass further east, through the kingdom of the Itza.
[108]
Spanish-Itza diplomatic contacts, 1695
[
edit
]
In December 1695 the Spanish colonial authorities in Mérida received a diplomatic visit sent by the Aj Kan Ekʼ.
[109]
The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo,
alcalde
of Bacalar-at-Chunjujubʼ. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695,
[110]
who arrived around the same time that the Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain.
[55]
In August Hariza travelled to Mérida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain.
[111]
Four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities.
[112]
The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan,
[113]
a nephew of the Itza king.
[114]
When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza-Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696.
[115]
AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.
[116]
English-language reproduction of Avendaño's 1696 map of Lake Petén Itzá
[117]
In December, Kan Ekʼ despatched AjChan to negotiate peace with Spain,
[118]
with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to Mérida by a small number of Mopans from the Tipuj region.
[116]
AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from
Chichen Itza
in the northern Yucatán. His marriage to a Kowoj woman had been an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza-Kowoj hostility. Kan Ekʼ sent AjChan to Mérida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain.
[114]
The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery.
[118]
The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Petén, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Martín Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Martín de Ursúa, governor of Yucatán, acting as his godfather.
[109]
The arrival of AjChan and his subsequent baptism was an important diplomatic coup for Ursúa, who used the visit for his own political advancement, promoting the embassy as the peaceful final submission of the Itza kingdom to the Spanish Crown.
[109]
This formal submission of the Itza kingdom to Spain was a critical turning point, since from a Spanish legal viewpoint the Itza were now subjects and the royal prohibition on military conquest could be sidestepped.
[119]
AjChan left Mérida with his companions and a Spanish escort in the middle of January 1696 and arrived back at Tipuj around the end of the month. After a few days at Tipuj he learnt of violent events unfolding around Lake Petén Itzá including the battle at Chʼichʼ and the subsequent killing of two Franciscans. Fearing the response of his Spanish escort, he abandoned them and fled back to Yalain.
[120]
García de Paredes' entry from Yucatán, March-April 1695
[
edit
]
The governor of Yucatán,
Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi
, began to build the road from Campeche south towards Petén.
[91]
At the beginning of March 1695, Ursúa ordered captain Alonso García de Paredes to explore this road; García led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by native guides, muleteers and labourers. García had previous experience from military expeditions around Sajkabʼchen (near modern Xcabacab in southern Campeche state)
[121]
The expedition advanced some way south of Sajkabʼchen into Kejache territory, which began at Chunpich, about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north of the modern border between Mexico and Guatemala.
[121]
He rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements, but met with armed Kejache resistance. A skirmish ensued at a Kejache village, resulting in the deaths of eight Kejache warriors. Prisoners taken during the skirmish informed García that many independent Maya lived in the area, both Kejache and others. García decided to retreat around the middle of April, probably to escort captured Kejache back to Sajkabʼchen to be put to work on García's
encomienda
. Captain García reported back to Ursúa on 21 April 1695.
[122]
Díaz de Velasco and Cano's entry from Verapaz, March-April 1695
[
edit
]
The modern town of San Luis, founded upon the Mopan capital
In March 1695, captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set out from
Cahabón
in
Alta Verapaz
with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by
Criollo
friar Agustín Cano accompanied the expedition.
[123]
Theoretically the Spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for the Dominicans.
[124]
The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were secretly trying to reach the Itzas before Martín de Ursúa could reach them from Yucatán; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala and the governor of Yucatán.
[125]
It formed a part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Petén and neighbouring Chiapas; the other two expeditions were launched against the Lakandon.
[22]
The expedition proceeded northwards through Chʼol territory and into Mopan territory; there they camped at Mopan town (modern
San Luis
). Due to their fear of their warlike Itza neighbours, both the Chʼol and the Mopans claimed not to know of any paths to Lake Petén Itzá.
[126]
The Spanish were held up at Mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions among their native carriers. The Dominicans took advantage of the delay to proselytise the Mopans and Cano wrote that he had converted four
caciques
(native chiefs) there, although Taxim Chan, king of the Mopans, had fled with many of the local inhabitants. Cano believed that the Mopans were ruled by the king of the Itzas.
[127]
First skirmish
[
edit
]
The Spanish believed that by pressing ahead to Lake Petén Itzá they would link up with a simultaneous expedition headed by President Barrios himself, unaware that Barrios had not reached the region. Díaz de Velasco sent out a scouting party of 50 musketeers accompanied by native archers on 6 April. They soon found evidence of recent Itza camps in the area, estimated to be a month old. The scouts found a clear road heading north to the Itza kingdom, and the army set off along it. The main force camped about ten
leagues
[nb 3]
(26 miles or 42 km) south of the lake, while a smaller scouting party was sent off ahead; this consisted of two Spanish soldiers, two archers and two muleteers from Verapaz, with two Chʼol-speaking native interpreters. The scouting party advanced to the savannah just to the south of Lake Petén Itzá, where they encountered about 30 Itza hunters armed with spears, shields and bows, accompanied by hunting dogs. The hunters drew their weapons and prepared to fight, but the Mopan interpreter was instructed to explain that the Spanish party were traders who came in peace, accompanied by missionaries.
[127]
The Spanish began to suspect that the interpreter was plotting against them with the Itza hunters, and one of the Verapaz archers dragged him out from among the hunters.
[129]
The encounter degenerated into a scuffle, and the Itzas once again drew weapons. The Spanish fired their muskets, fatally wounding two hunters, and a Verapaz Indian charged the Itzas with a machete. The hunters fled, leaving the scouting party in possession of the food and arrows at the hunting camp.
[130]
Second skirmish
[
edit
]
Five days after this skirmish,
[130]
Antonio Machuca led a party of 12 musketeers, 25 archers and 13 muleteers to try to find President Barrios, to scout a river route to the lake and to capture another interpreter, the previous one no longer being trusted. The main party arrived on the savannah near the lake. The following night one of the advance party came back into camp with an Itza prisoner, captured after a fierce struggle with the scouts. Interrogation of the prisoner revealed that he was from a high-ranking Itza lineage, and that he had been sent out to find the Spanish party and to see if they came as traders or invaders.
[131]
The rest of Machuca's scouting party soon returned to the main camp, reporting that they had camped four leagues (approximately 10.4 miles or 16.7 km) from the lake, where they encountered another hunting party of about "a dozen" Itzas. The Spanish tried to use their interpreter to talk to them but the Itzas responded with a volley of arrows. The Spanish musketeers tried to respond with musketfire, but found their gunpowder too wet to fire properly. The Itza warriors charged upon them with spears, axes and machetes, and the ensuing hand-to-hand battle lasted an hour, during which six of the Itzas were killed; the rest finally retreated. Thanks to their padded cotton armour, the Spanish party received no injuries from the skirmish. The Spanish pursued the fleeing Itzas and another fierce skirmish ensued, lasting another hour during which most of the remaining Itzas were killed.
[132]
Three Itzas escaped, and their leader was rendered unconscious with machete blows to the head; he was taken prisoner and later made a full recovery.
[133]
Machuca's party reached the lakeshore and could see Nojpetén across the water, but saw such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to the main camp.
[124]
An Itza account of this encounter reached the colonial authorities in Yucatán via Tipuj. The Itza reported that the Guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of Nojpetén, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered to talk to the intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture of one and yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujubʼ, Yucatán, was in Nojpetén around this time, and reported that the Itza gathered 3,000-4,000 warriors ready to repulse Díaz de Velasco's party.
[55]
Retreat to Guatemala
[
edit
]
On 24 April, the first prisoner escaped from the main camp; the same day that the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men.
[134]
Interrogation of the new prisoner, who turned out to be an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish.
[135]
Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness,
[124]
and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.
[136]
The new prisoner, AjKʼixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail.
[135]
In Guatemala AjKʼixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors.
[134]
After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.
[137]
García de Paredes' entry from Yucatán, May 1695
[
edit
]
17th-century entry routes to Petén from Yucatán and Guatemala, with some of the placenames mentioned in the text
When captain García de Paredes unexpectedly returned to Campeche in early May 1695, governor Martín de Ursúa was already preparing reinforcements for his expedition. With García's arrival, he was immediately allocated the extra soldiers.
[136]
On 11 May Ursúa ordered García to begin a second expedition southwards and was allotted 100 salaried Maya to accompany him. These workers were to be paid three pesos per month and received a suspension of their obligations to supply
encomienda
work and tribute.
[138]
García paid for additional Spanish soldiers from his own funds, as did José Fernández de Estenos, a Campeche resident who was to serve as second-in-command.
[139]
The final force numbered 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers; the final tally was more than 400 people, which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished Yucatán province.
[138]
Ursúa also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from
Tekʼax
and Oxkʼutzkabʼ to join the expedition at Bʼolonchʼen Kawich, some 60 kilometres (37 mi) southeast of the city of Campeche.
[140]
Bonifacio Us was captain of the Tekʼax company; Diego Uk was that of the Oxkʼutzkabʼ company. Marcos Pot was overall "cacique captain" of these two Maya companies; all three officers were Maya. A Maya company from Sajkabʼchen served as elite musketeers charged with rounding up forest Maya into the
reducciones
; this company was excused from heavy labour duties. Non-Maya soldiers were a mix of Spanish,
mestizos
(mixed race Spanish and native) and
mulattos
(mixed race Spanish and black).
[141]
On 18 May Ursúa requested three missionaries to support the expedition from the Franciscan
provincial superior
, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother who had not yet taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother.
[142]
This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa.
[143]
In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García.
[144]
On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakbʼajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops.
[141]
By this time García was at Tzuktokʼ, near the Kejache border.
[145]
Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakbʼajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Chʼol isolated to the west.
[146]
Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake.
[147]
A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the
Camino Real
("Royal Road") project;
[148]
the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué.
[149]
On 27 July Ursúa authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce García. Two were Spanish companies and one was a mixed-race company consisting of mestizos and pardos.
[150]
[nb 4]
Skirmish at Chunpich
[
edit
]
The Sajkabʼchen company of native musketeers pushed ahead with the road builders from Tzuktzokʼ to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, leaving behind a substantial amount of food. The company's officers sent for reinforcements from García at Tzuktokʼ but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkabʼchen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish, and the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury, mocking the invaders. The Sajkabʼchen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.
[152]
Reinforcements
[
edit
]
Around 3 August García moved his entire army forward to Chunpich,
[153]
and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the
San Pedro River
.
[154]
By November Tzuktokʼ was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month García once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Ursúa was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the despatch of reinforcements along the
Camino Real
to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers.
[155]
An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers met up with García at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the
Camino Real
towards the San Pedro River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.
[156]
Avendaño's entry from Yucatán, June 1695
[
edit
]
In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for Petén; the first group was to join up with García's military expedition. The second group was to head for Lake Petén Itza independently. This second group was headed by friar Andrés de Avendaño. Avendaño was accompanied by friar Antonio Pérez de San Román, lay brother Alonso de Vargas and six Maya Christians recruited from Mérida and towns en route to Campeche.
[157]
This latter group left Mérida on 2 June 1695 and made its way to Juan del Castillo y Arrué's supply base at Kawich, set up to support García's military expedition.
[158]
On 24 June Avendaño's party left Kawich and set off across sparsely inhabited territory.
[159]
On 29 June they arrived at an abandoned Maya temple, which he referred to by the name Nojku, meaning "Big Temple". The Spanish had already passed through and had broken many "idols" but the friars climbed the temple and managed to find about 50 additional ceremonial sculptures, which they destroyed; they also placed a cross inside. The other group of friars, on their way to join García, passed through Nojku a few days later and found that local Maya had already placed new offerings within.
[160]
Avendaño's group continued southwards and found increasing signs of habitation and arrived at the military camp of captain José Fernández de Estenos at the deserted Maya town of Nojtʼubʼ, which had been cleared by the Spanish under García some sixteen years previously.
[161]
Avendaño continued south along the course of the new road, finding increasing evidence of Spanish military activity, with the rounding up of local inhabitants and raiding of fields and orchards for provisions by Spanish troops. The Franciscans overtook García at Bʼukʼte, about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) before Tzuktokʼ.
[150]
Avendaño's party arrived at Tzuktokʼ, near the Kejache border, by 10 July and left two weeks later, around the same time that García arrived there with his captives rounded up at Bʼukʼte for forced labour. Before leaving, the Franciscans protested to García and his officers about the poor treatment of the local inhabitants; the officers promised better treatment of the Maya in future.
[162]
On 3 August García advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avendaño to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from Bʼukʼte. Avendaño instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions,
[163]
seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of García's advance companies and had now retreated into the forest.
[164]
He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom. He met four exhausted Sajkabʼchen musketeers who were carrying a letter addressed to him from captain Fernández de Estenos. This letter explained that further south there were various deserted Maya towns with only rotten maize abandoned by their occupiers. Avendaño returned to Tzuktokʼ and reconsidered his plans; the Franciscans were short of supplies, and the forcefully congregated Maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into the forest daily. Additionally, the Spanish officers ignored the concerns of the friars and García was abducting local Maya women and children to be taken back to his
encomienda
for forced labour.
[165]
The Franciscans set upon a different, ultimately unsuccessful, plan; they would follow the road back north to Jopʼelchʼen near Campeche city and attempt to reach the Itza via Tipuj.
[166]
This route was blocked when the
secular clergy
prevented the Franciscans from attempting it. Antonio de Silva ordered Avendaño to return to Mérida, and he arrived there on 17 September 1695.
[167]
The other group of Franciscans, led by Juan de San Buenaventura Chávez, continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory, through IxBʼam, Bʼatkabʼ and Chuntuki (modern Chuntunqui near
Carmelita, Petén
).
[168]
San Buenaventura among the Kejache, September-November 1695
[
edit
]
View of the forest of the Kejache region from
El Tintal
, near the former Spanish mission at Chuntuki
Juan de San Buenaventura's small group of Franciscans had arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, and found that the army had opened the road southwards for another seventeen leagues (approximately 44.2 miles or 71.1 km), almost half way to Lake Petén Itzá, but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains.
[169]
San Buenaventura was accompanied by friar Joseph de Jesús María, lay friar Tomás de Alcoser and lay brother Lucas de San Francisco.
[142]
With Avendaño's return to Mérida, provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura's group: Diego de Echevarría and Diego de Salas. One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktokʼ, and the other was to do the same at Chuntuki. Although initially reluctant to permit the group to continue into Itza territory, by late October García de Paredes had relented and acquiesced to de Silva's instructions for San Buenaventura and his original companions to continue to Nojpetén,
[170]
although it appears that this never happened.
[155]
On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship.
[171]
On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pakʼekʼem, where another 300 Kejache resided. San Buenaventura sent lay brother Lucas de San Francisco to convince them to relocate to the Chuntuki mission. Lucas de San Francisco destroyed the idols in Pakʼekʼem but the inhabitants were not brought to the mission because of worries about feeding the new arrivals.
[172]
Instead, in early November 1695, friar Tomás de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pakʼekʼem, where they were well received by the cacique and his pagan priest. Pakʼekʼem was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at Bʼatkabʼ to attend to over 100 Kʼejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of friar Diego de Echevarría;
[173]
a further church was established at Tzuktokʼ, overseen by Diego de Salas.

Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696;
[175]
he followed the new road as far as possible then continued towards Nojpetén with local Maya guides.
[176]
He was accompanied by friars Antonio Pérez de San Román, Joseph de Jesús María and Diego de Echevarría, and by lay brother Lucas de San Francisco; some of these he collected on his journey south along the
Camino Real
. On 5 January they caught up with and passed the main contingent of the army at Bʼatkabʼ, continuing to Chuntuki.
[177]
From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins, which was recorded as Tanxulukmul by Avendaño.
[178]
[nb 5]
From Tanxulukmul they followed the small Acté River to a Chakʼan Itza town called Saklemakal.
[180]
[nb 6]
They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza.
[182]
Unknown to the Franciscans, the northern Chakʼan Itza province of the Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was at war with the Itza king. The Chakʼan Itzas carried off most of the gifts that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing.
[180]
The following day, the current Aj Kan Ekʼ travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chakʼan Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza.
[183]
The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ekʼ and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ekʼ to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success.
[182]
The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the Kʼatun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year
Maya calendrical cycle
beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord.
[184]
The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain.
[182]
On 19 January AjKowoj, the king of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño,
[185]
arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule.
[186]
The discussions between Avendaño, Kan Ekʼ and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza - and the apparent treachery of the Itza king in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's power over his own people.
[187]
Kan Ekʼ learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their Chakʼan Itza allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj.
[188]
The Itza king's efforts to save his Spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule; from that point on anti-Spanish sentiment governed Itza responses to the Spanish.
[189]
The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were well received but while they were there the Yalain heard rumours of battle and a Spanish advance towards Lake Petén Itzá.
[190]
The Franciscans were shown a path that led to Tipuj but their Yalain guides soon abandoned them.
[191]
The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avendaño's companions,
[192]
but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki and from there made their way back to Mérida.
[193]
Battle at Chʼichʼ, 2 February 1696
[
edit
]
Kan Ekʼ had sent emissaries to Mérida in December 1695 to inform Martín de Ursúa that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule.
[194]
By mid-January captain García de Paredes had advanced from Bʼatkabʼ to the advance portion of the
Camino Real
at Chuntuki.
[195]
By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters, with many of his soldiers deserting as the force advanced towards Lake Petén Itzá; they were further delayed by the necessity of building an oar-powered longboat (or
piragua
) to cross the San Pedro River.
[196]
Soon after Avendaño's flight eastward from Nojpetén, a group of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they claimed to have been sent by Avendaño to collect religious regalia and another friar. This was not the case, and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by the Kowoj and their Chakʼan Itza allies to see what progress the Spanish army was making along the road.
[197]
They spoke with García and then rapidly departed without taking any of the items that they had supposedly been sent to collect.
[196]
García despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover Avendaño's whereabouts; at the same time Avendaño's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from Nojpetén with news of Avendaño's flight.
[198]
The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by Avendaño before his departure from Nojpetén as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish.
[199]
Friar Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to travel on to Nojpetén himself.
[198]
García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, his senior officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors.
[200]
They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition was approached by two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza;
[198]
these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing him that he could advance safely.
[201]
The port town of Chʼichʼ was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors.
[202]
The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.
[203]
The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this point about 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.
[204]
A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled at the start of the battle and took news to García that the entire expedition had been slaughtered;
[205]
Zubiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back into the base camp at Chuntuki two days later.
[204]
Ursúa later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpetén where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpetén in 1697;
[206]
AjKʼin Kan Ekʼ, the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out their hearts.
[207]
This turn of events convinced Martín de Ursúa that Kan Ekʼ would not surrender peacefully, and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén.
[194]
The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached García's camp.
[208]
Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Chʼichʼ the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.
[204]
Amésqueta's entry from Verapaz, February-March 1696
[
edit
]
The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year.
[82]
Barrios died in November, and
oidor
José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed
oidor
Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza.
[209]
Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán.
[210]
Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjKʼixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz.
[209]
Once they arrived at IxBʼol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjKʼixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén.
[211]
Amésqueta's attempt to locate Díaz de Velasco
[
edit
]
Back in Mopán, Amésqueta had received additional supplies and decided to catch up with his advance party. He left Mopán on 10 March 1696 with friar Agustín Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from Díaz or AjKʼixaw. On 20 March Amésqueta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find Díaz's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that Díaz had left behind. They followed Díaz's trail to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes,
[212]
and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that Díaz's party had passed that way, and Amésqueta assumed that they had crossed to Nojpetén. He wrote a letter to Díaz, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with Amésqueta.
[213]
During various attempts at communication to verify Díaz's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of Amésqueta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in Díaz's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.
[214]
Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjKʼixaw had betrayed them and that this was precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men.
[215]
As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby.
[216]
In the early hours of the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches.
[217]
They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies.
[218]
The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4 miles or 37.7 km) north of Mopan.
[219]
Fate of Díaz de Velasco's expedition
[
edit
]
Writing after the fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano described the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Chʼol witnesses, although there were no Chʼol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a
rosary
as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.
[220]
Once on the lake the Itza overturned some of the canoes and killed some of Díaz's men; others were wounded and dragged ashore to be killed. Díaz, the Dominicans and two other men were in a large canoe that was not overturned and were taken to Nojpetén where a fierce struggle ensued as Díaz attempted to defend himself with his sword, killing several Itzas. The two other men were immediately killed while the friars were beaten and tied to X-shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out. Across the lake, the Itza attacked the porters guarding the expedition supplies and killed all of them. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers. The remains of the small group that were killed on Nojpetén were later retrieved by the Spanish after the fall of the city and were taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala for burial.
[220]
Aftermath of Amésqueta's entry
[
edit
]
Over the following weeks scouts were sent out to try to make contact with local Mopan and Chʼol communities, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxBʼol and Manche without success - most of the natives had fled, leaving the forest deserted. At San Pedro Mártir he received news of AjChan's embassy to Mérida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority.
[219]
Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men at Lake Petén Itzá, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned the unfinished fort.
[221]
Friar Cano recommended to the new Guatemalan president that the Chʼol be moved to Verapaz where they could be properly administered. As a result of the failed expedition, Cano's recommendation was accepted, the fort was dismantled and any Maya that could be captured across a wide swathe of southern Petén was forcibly relocated to Belén near Rabinal in Verapaz. This way this relocation was conducted was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high-ranking colonial officials, including
oidor
José de Escals and even by Amésqueta.
[222]
Fall of Nojpetén
[
edit
]
Lake Petén Itza at the time of the conquest
The Itzas' continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were dispatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.
[184]
The final assault was made possible by the gradual opening of the road from Mérida to Petén;
[223]
by December 1696 this road had reached the lake shore although it was unfinished and still almost impassable in places.
[224]
By this time the deep divisions between the political leaders of the Itza were such that a unified defence of the Itza kingdom had become impossible.
[225]
Final preparations
[
edit
]
In late December 1696 the Chakʼan Itza attacked the large Kejache mission town of Pakʼekʼem; they abducted almost all the inhabitants and burned the church. The demoralised Spanish garrison at Chuntuki buried their weapons and ammunition and retreated five leagues (approximately 13 miles or 21 km) back towards Campeche.
[226]
From late December 1696 to the middle of January 1697 Ursúa sent parties of soldiers and workmen along the road towards the lake; the first group was commanded by Pedro de Zubiaur and had instructions to begin building a
galeota
, a large oar-powered warship.
[227]
This group was followed by reinforcements bringing supplies, including light and heavy weapons, gunpowder and food. On 23 January Ursúa left Campeche with more soldiers and muleteers, bringing the total number of soldiers arriving as reinforcements to 130.
[228]
The Spanish fortified their positions at Chʼichʼ and deployed heavy artillery for its defence.
[229]
Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of lake Petén Itzá with his soldiers on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily armed
galeota
attack boat, which was assembled at Chʼichʼ over a space of 12 days in early March.
[230]
The
galeota
had a
keel
of 30 cubits or 14.4 metres (47 ft); it had 12 oars on each side and a rudder with an iron screw. The
galeota
carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces, including a
pieza
(light cannon) and four
pedreros
(mortars).
[40]
The
piragua
longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake to be used in the attack on the Itza capital; this boat had 6 oars and a rudder.
[231]
From 28 February onwards the Spanish expedition was repeatedly approached by hostile Itzas, who sometimes shot arrows in the direction of the intruders but inflicted no casualties.
[232]
At the same time, small groups of curious Itzas mingled freely with the Spanish and received trinkets from them such as belts, necklaces and earrings.
[229]
Assault on Nojpetén
[
edit
]
On 10 March, Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Chʼichʼ to negotiate with Ursúa. First came AjChan who had already met him in Mérida; he was followed by Chamach Xulu, the ruler of the Yalain.
[233]
Kan Ekʼ then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ekʼ to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ekʼ failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors massed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.
[234]
Ursúa decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless, and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March.
[235]
The encampment at Chʼichʼ was left defended by 25 Spanish soldiers, three Maya musketeers and several artillery pieces.
[236]
Ursúa boarded the
galeota
with 108 soldiers, two secular priests, five personal servants, the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother-in-law and an Itza prisoner from Nojpetén. The attack boat was rowed east from Chʼichʼ towards the Itza capital; halfway across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to Nojpetén, covering about 600 metres (2,000 ft) from one shore to another - Ursúa simply gave the order to row through them. A large number of defenders had gathered along the shore of Nojpetén and on the roofs of the city. As the
galeota
approached, more canoes put out from the shore and the Spanish were surrounded.
[237]
Once they had surrounded the
galeota
, Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders. Ursúa gave orders to his men not to fire but arrows wounded several soldiers; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men. The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire.
[238]
The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island;
[239]
the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water.
[240]
After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town.
[184]
Martín de Ursúa planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpetén as
Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza
("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza").
[241]
The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Petén; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties.
[242]
Kan Ekʼ was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu;
[243]
The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families.
[239]
With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.
[86]
Aftermath
[
edit
]
Martín de Ursúa had little interest in administering the newly conquered territory and delegated its control to military officers who he did very little to support, either militarily or financially.
[244]
With Nojpetén safely in the hands of the Spanish, Ursúa returned to Mérida, leaving Kan Ekʼ and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, isolated among the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race
ladino
civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to Santiago; Ajaw Kan Ekʼ and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the colonial capital.
[239]
When the Spanish conquered the Petén lakes in 1697, the Yalain were initially cooperative and assisted in the capture of the king of the Itza. At this time Yalain was ruled by Chamach Xulu. The Yalain leadership encouraged Christian conversion as a means of maintaining peace with the occupying Spanish forces. As time went on, Yalain cooperation with the Spanish appears to have decreased.
[243]
Soon after the conquest, the Yalain fled their settlements to avoid foraging Spanish parties that were abducting Maya women for "service" at their barracks. At this time, such was the hostility that was felt towards the occupying forces that the inhabitants of the Yalain settlements preferred to burn their fields and break all their pottery rather than leave anything for the Spanish.
[245]
The Yalain capital is recorded as having been burned in 1698.
[246]
Final years of conquest
[
edit
]
Spanish colonial church in Dolores
Castillo de Arismendi, built in Nuestra Señora de los Remedios (modern Flores)
In the late 17th century, the small population of Chʼol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Qʼeqchiʼ population.
[84]
After the conquest, the colonial administration of Petén was divided between the ecclesiastical authorities in Yucatán and secular administration as part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. There was never a strong Spanish presence in the area, which remained remote, although the Spanish built a fortress-prison, the
Castillo de Arismendi
; it was finished in 1700.
[247]
The distance from Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo (formerly Nojpetén) to Mérida, combined with the difficult terrain and the hostility of the natives led to the road from Yucatán falling into a state of disrepair.
[223]
In 1701 Ursúa y Arezmendi realised that the road was in such a poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucatán. He wrote to the King of Spain, requesting that Petén be transferred from the jurisdiction of Yucatán to the
Audiencia Real
of Guatemala.
[248]
In 1703 Ursúa's petition was granted, with the condition that the ecclesiastical authority over Petén would pass to the Dominican Order.
[249]
Between 1703 and 1753,
reducciones
were established at San José and San Andrés on Lake Petén Itzá, Santa Ana just south of the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and
Dolores
in the south (not to be confused with Dolores del Lakandon).
[250]
Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the
vicario general
with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo.
[249]
In the first decades of the 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andrés, San José and Santo Toribio.
[251]
The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante.
[252]
In 1699 there were nine priests in Petén but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Petén. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Petén, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucatán, and it was the Franciscans who oversaw the spiritual welfare of Petén during the colonial period.
[253]
AjTut was one of the lords of the northern Chakʼan Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avendaño had met him during his expedition to Nojpetén. After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of
Tikal
. For some years after the conquest he established the Mompana region as a refuge from the Spanish and engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.
[254]
Reductions around Lake Petén Itzá
[
edit
]
At the time of the fall of Nojpetén, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.
[35]
Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.
[36]
Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702-1703.
[239]
The first towns to be concentrated into colonial
reducciones
were Ixtutz, which became the new town of
San José
, and neighbouring San Andrés, both on the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá.
[255]
They were first subjugated by one of Ursúa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants.
[249]
Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpetén,
[256]
but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén.
[239]
The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the
Itza language
.
[249]
Legacy of the conquest
[
edit
]
Martín de Ursúa used his conquest of the Itza as a stepping stone to achieving the coveted post of
Governor-General of the Philippines
, which he took up in 1709.
[257]
European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Petén, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Petén Itzá numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Petén, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called "wild" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Petén was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts.
[258]
During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into
debt peonage
. Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.
[259]
San José, on the northwest shore of lake Petén Itzá, is the home of the last surviving speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities. In modern times there is a history of conflict between San José (the former Itza town of Chakokʼot) and neighbouring San Andrés (the former Kowoj-allied town of Chakʼan), and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.
[260]

[261]
in which he details his crossing of what is now Guatemala's Petén Department.

Franciscan friar Andrés Avendaño y Loyola recorded his own account of his late 17th century journeys to Nojpetén, written in 1696 and entitled
Relación de las entradas que hize a la conversión de los gentiles Ytzaex
("Account of the expeditions that I made to convert the Itza heathens").
[266]
When the Spanish finally conquered Petén in 1697 they produced a vast quantity of documentation.
[87]
Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor was a Spanish colonial official who first held the post of relator of the
Royal Chancery of Valladolid
and later as that of the Council of the Indies. As such he had access to the large amount of colonial documents stored in the
General Archive of the Indies
. From these he produced his
Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon, y otras naciones de indios barbaros, de la mediacion de el Reyno de Guatimala, a las provincias del Yucatan en la América Septentrional
("History of the Conquest of the Province of the Itza, reduction, and advances in that of the Lakandon, and other nations of barbarous indians, and the intervention of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and the provinces of Yucatan in Northern America"). This was first published in Madrid in 1701 and detailed the history of Petén from 1525 through to 1699.
[267]
Archaeology
[
edit
]
Ursúa referred to the western port town of Chʼichʼ as
Nich
. The modern name for a point on the south side of the bay is Punta Nijtún, which is probably derived from the colonial Yucatec
nix tun
, meaning stone ramp.
[268]
Archaeologists carried out excavations at the lake shore at Punta Nijtún and discovered a stone ramp there, which was probably built by Ursúa's troops to launch his
galeota
.

The
National Museum of Saudi Arabia
(
Arabic
:
المتحف الوطني السعودي
) is a
national museum
located in the
al-Murabba
neighborhood of
Riyadh
,
Saudi Arabia
. Established in 1999,
[2]
[3]
[4]
it is part of the
King Abdulaziz Historical Centre
and is surrounded by al-Wadi Park to the north and al-Madi Park to the east, who altogether constitute eastern side of the
National Museum Park

The National Museum was part of the "Murabba' Development Plan" to refurbish the area of and around the old
Murabba' Palace
district for the Centennial Celebrations in Saudi Arabia. Thus the deadline was set to early 1999, leaving only 26 months
[5]
for the planning and building of the museum from scratch, although ideas for such a museum had been discussed since the eighties. For the design the lead architect
Raymond Moriyama
was inspired by the form and colors of the sand dunes of the "Red Sands" just outside Riyadh.
[6]
The west facade along Murabba' Square resembles the soft contour of a sandune with its layout forming a crescent pointing towards Mecca.
[5]
The west facade opens into an Islamic history of the Arabian Peninsula. For the final galleries the visitor enters the "Unification Drum" which has displays about the current Saudi State.  The last gallery illustrates the two holy mosques and the hajj. Additionally there are two further galleries for special exhibitions.
The concept for the didactic design of the exhibitions is somewhat different from the traditional approach of the classic museums. There is less emphasis on individual exhibits displayed out of their cultural context as objects of great value. There are a great many replicas and life size dioramic displays, illustrating and educating about certain points and issues. As such it is sometimes difficult to identify certain specific pieces and even tell replicas from originals. The idea behind this is not to focus on individual pieces in their own right but rather use them as examples to highlight the general ideas or concepts they represent.
[6]
Halls
[

There are eight halls in the museum:

Darth Vader
is a fictional character in the
Star Wars
franchise. The character is the central antagonist of the
original trilogy
and, as
Anakin Skywalker
, is one of the main
protagonists
in the
prequel trilogy
.
Star Wars
creator
George Lucas
has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".
[1]
Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever.
[2]
[3]
His masked face and helmet, in particular, is one of the most iconic character designs of all time.
Originally a slave on
Tatooine
, Anakin Skywalker is a
Jedi
prophesied to bring balance to
the Force
. He is lured to the
dark side of the Force
by Chancellor
Palpatine
and becomes a
Sith
Lord, assuming the name of Darth Vader and helping his new master all but destroy the Jedi Order. After a
lightsaber
battle with his former mentor
Obi-Wan Kenobi
on
Mustafar
, in which he is severely injured, Vader is transformed into a
cyborg
. Now Palpatine's right-hand, he serves the
Galactic Empire
for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi as well as the
Rebel Alliance
. Vader ultimately redeems himself by saving his son,
Luke Skywalker
, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process.
[4]
He is also the secret husband of
Padmé Amidala
, the biological father of
Princess Leia
, and the grandfather of
Kylo Ren
(Ben Solo). In the non-canonical
Star Wars Legends
continuity
, he is also the grandfather of Luke's son
Ben
, and Leia's sons
Anakin
and
Jacen
and daughter
Jaina
, and the great-grandfather of Jacen's daughter
Allana
.
The character has been portrayed by numerous actors:
David Prowse
physically portrayed Vader in the original trilogy, while
James Earl Jones
has voiced him in all of the films and some television shows.
Sebastian Shaw
portrayed the unmasked Anakin in
Return of the Jedi
, as well as the character's spirit in the original release of that film.
[e]
Jake Lloyd
played Anakin Skywalker as a child in
The Phantom Menace
, the first film of the prequel trilogy, while
Hayden Christensen
played him as a young adult in the following two films, post-2004 releases of
Return of the Jedi
,
[h]
and the television series
Obi-Wan Kenobi
and
Ahsoka
.
In addition to the first six
Star Wars
films, the character appears in the anthology film
Rogue One
. He also appears in television series (most substantially
The Clone Wars
) and numerous iterations of the
Star Wars
Expanded Universe, including video games, novels, and comic books. Due to Vader's popularity, various merchandise of the character, such as
action figures
and replicas of his lightsaber, has been produced.
Creation and development
Name
George Lucas
, who created Vader's character
According to
Star Wars
creator
George Lucas
, he experimented with various combinations of names for the character built upon the phrase "Dark Water". He then "added lots of last names, Vaders and Wilsons and Smiths, and ... just came up with the combination of Darth and Vader". After the release of
The Empire Strikes Back
(1980), Lucas stated that the name Vader was based upon the
German
/
Dutch
-language word
vater
or
vader
('father'), suggesting "Dark Father" and the character's relationship with
original-trilogy
protagonist
Luke Skywalker
.
[5]
Other words which may have inspired the name are "death" and "invader",
[6]
as well as the name of a high-school upperclassman of Lucas's, Gary Vader.
[7]
[8]
As no other character with the title "Darth" was introduced until the release of
The Phantom Menace
(1999),
[u]
some viewers interpreted it as the character's first name, in part because
Obi-Wan Kenobi
addresses him as "Darth" in
the original film
.
[9]
[v]
The moniker is bestowed upon Anakin in
Revenge of the Sith
(2005) upon his turn to the dark side of
the Force
.
Director
Ken Annakin
's films
Swiss Family Robinson
and
Battle of the Bulge
influenced the
original trilogy
,
[10]
leading some to believe that Anakin was named after him. Lucas' publicist denied this following Annakin's death in 2009.
[11]
Anakin and Luke's original surname "Starkiller" remained in the script until a few months into filming
Star Wars
, when it was dropped due to what Lucas called "unpleasant connotations" with
Charles Manson
and replaced with "Skywalker".
[12]
[w]
In other countries
In France, the character's name was changed to "
Dark Vador
" starting with the original film. The names of other characters were changed too, but his is the only name that has been maintained even in the most recent films. The title "Dark" was used in place of "Darth" for the other
Sith
lords as well.
[14]
In the
Italian-language
editions, Darth Vader is named "
Dart Fener
". In 2005, before the release of
Episode III
, an online survey asked Italian fans whether they would rather maintain the Italian name or switch it to the original: the first option won. In 2015, when
Episode VII
had to be released, the Italian localisation decided to change the name to the English "Darth Vader".
[15]
In
Iceland
his name is "
Svarthöfði
" (which means "blackhead").
Concept and writing
In the first draft of
The Star Wars
, tall, grim general "Darth Vader" was already close in line with his final depiction, and the protagonist Annikin Starkiller had a role similar to that of his son Luke's as the 16-year-old son of a respected warrior.
[16]
Originally, Lucas conceived of the
Sith
as a group that served the
Emperor
in the same way that the
Schutzstaffel
served
Adolf Hitler
. In developing the backstory for
The Empire Strikes Back
, Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Vader.
[17]
After the success of the original
Star Wars
film, Lucas hired science-fiction author
Leigh Brackett
to write the sequel with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten
treatment
. He wrote, "When we kill [Vader] off in the [third film], we'll reveal ... [h]e wants to be human—he's still fighting in his own way the dark side of the Force." Lucas considered introducing a new lair for Vader to replace the
Death Star
; these included an Imperial City, a cave, "a little castle on a rock in the middle of the ocean", and "a tall, dark tower, very narrow in a lava flow".
[18]
[x]
In Brackett's draft, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct him.
[19]
Lucas was disappointed with Brackett's script, but she died of cancer before he could discuss it with her.
[20]
Amongst other issues, Lucas found Vader's characterization unsatisfactory, e.g. expository dialogue near the beginning.
[18]
[y]
With no writer available, Lucas wrote the next draft himself. In this script, dated April 1, 1978, he utilized a new plot twist: Vader claims to be Luke's father.
[21]
According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles writing the first film.
[22]
Lucas has said that he knew Vader was Luke's father while writing the first film,
[23]
though the relationship is not explicitly evidenced before said draft of
The Empire Strikes Back
.
[21]
[24]
[25]
Although Lucas kept Vader's identity secret, even to the cast and crew of
The Empire Strikes Back
, Vader's physical portrayer,
David Prowse
, stated to the press in 1978 that in the sequel, "Luke learns that Darth is, in fact, his long-lost father."
[26]
The new plot element of Luke's parentage had drastic effects on the series. Author Michael Kaminski argues in
The Secret History of Star Wars
that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978, and that the first film was clearly operating under a storyline where Vader was a separate character from Luke's father.
[27]
After writing the second and third drafts in which the
plot point
was introduced, Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created: Anakin had been Obi-Wan Kenobi's brilliant student and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by
Palpatine
. Anakin battled Obi-Wan on a volcano and was badly wounded, but was then reborn as Vader. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan hid Luke on
Tatooine
while the
Galactic Republic
became the tyrannical
Galactic Empire
and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi.
[28]
An early draft of
Return of the Jedi
ended with Luke taking Vader's helmet and declaring, "Now I am Vader."
[29]
After deciding to create the
prequel trilogy
, Lucas indicated that the story arc would be a tragic one depicting Anakin's fall to the dark side. He also saw that the prequels could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death, in what he has termed "the tragedy of Darth Vader".
[1]
This was the final step towards turning the film series into a "saga".
[30]
For the first prequel,
Episode I: The Phantom Menace
(1999), Lucas made Anakin nine years old
[31]
[z]
to make the character's separation from his mother more poignant.
[33]
Movie trailers focused on Anakin and a one-sheet poster showing him casting Vader's shadow informed otherwise unknowing audiences of the character's eventual fate.
[34]
The movie ultimately achieved a primary goal of introducing audiences to Anakin,
[30]
as well as introducing the concept that he is the
Chosen One
of an ancient Jedi prophecy, destined to bring balance to the Force. Lucas states in an interview recorded around the time of the third prequel,
Revenge of the Sith
(2005), that "Anakin is
the Chosen One
. Even when Anakin turns into Darth Vader, he is still the Chosen One."
[35]
[36]
Hayden Christensen
spoke about Darth Vader's role in the six-film saga: "He believes that he's the Chosen One. He's not doing wrong things knowing that it's having a negative impact. So there's that sort of naivety to him now that wasn't there before, and it makes him more human in a lot of ways."
[36]
Michael Kaminski offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make fundamental story changes, first revising the opening sequence of
Revenge of the Sith
to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice,
Count Dooku
, killed by Anakin in cold blood as the first act in the latter's turn towards the dark side.
[37]
After
principal photography
was complete in 2003, Lucas re-wrote Anakin's turn to the dark side; Anakin's fall from grace would now be motivated by a desire to save his wife,
Padmé Amidala
, rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several, including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage, and new and revised scenes filmed during
pick-ups
in 2004.
[38]
During production of the animated
The Clone Wars
television series,
Ahsoka Tano
was developed to illustrate how Anakin develops from the brash, undisciplined Padawan apprentice in
Attack of the Clones
(2002) to the more reserved Jedi Knight in
Revenge of the Sith
.
[39]
Clone Wars
supervising director and
Star Wars Rebels
co-creator
Dave Filoni
said that giving Anakin responsibility for a Padawan was meant to place the character in a role that forced him to become more cautious and responsible. It would also give him insight into his relationship with Obi-Wan and depict how their relationship matured. Ahsoka and Anakin's relationship was seen as an essential story arc spanning both the animated film and
Clone Wars
television series.
[40]
Filoni began thinking about the final confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader ever since he created the former;
[41]
different iterations had different endings,
[42]
including one in which Vader kills Ahsoka just as she slashes open his helmet to reveal his scarred face.
[43]
A similar scene is included in an episode of
Rebels
, in which Ahsoka slashes Vader's helmet open, and the Sith Lord recognizes her.
[44]
According to Filoni, Ahsoka's presence in the series allows Vader to encounter the show's lead characters without the latter being "destroyed", as Ahsoka can "stand toe-to-toe" with her former master.
[45]
Design
Ralph McQuarrie incorporated
samurai armor
into his conceptual designs for Vader's costume in 1975.
Vader was not initially conceived of as wearing a helmet. The idea that he should wear a
breathing apparatus
was first proposed by
concept artist
Ralph McQuarrie
during preproduction discussions for
Star Wars
with Lucas in 1975. According to McQuarrie, Lucas directed him to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with
samurai armor
, stating, "George just said he would like to have a very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind."
[46]
Because the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to
survive in the vacuum of space
, McQuarrie proposed that Vader should wear a
space suit
. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie combined a full-face breathing mask with a
samurai helmet
, thus creating one of space-fantasy cinema's most iconic designs.
[47]
[46]
McQuarrie's
1975 production painting
of Vader engaged in a
lightsaber
duel with Deak Starkiller (a prototypical
Luke Skywalker
) depicts the former wearing black armor, a flowing cape and an elongated, skull-like mask and helmet. This initial design by McQuarrie was relatively close to Vader's final depiction.
[48]
Darth Vader designers
Ralph McQuarrie
Brian Muir
Working from McQuarrie's designs, costume designer
John Mollo
devised an outfit that could be worn by an actor onscreen using a combination of
clerical robes
, a
motorcycle suit
, a
German military helmet
and a
military gas mask
.
[49]
The prop sculptor
Brian Muir
created the helmet and armor used in the film.
[50]
Vader's chest plate includes
Hebrew
characters, some of which are upside down, and may constitute gibberish or jabber about redemption.
[51]
The sound of the
respirator
function of Vader's mask was created by
Ben Burtt
using modified recordings of
scuba breathing apparatus
used by divers.
[52]
The sound effect is trademarked in the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
under Trademark #77419252 and is officially described in the documentation as "The sound of rhythmic mechanical human breathing created by breathing through a scuba tank regulator."
[53]
Commentators have often pointed to the influence of
Akira Kurosawa
's films such as
The Hidden Fortress
(1958) on George Lucas, and Vader's samurai-inspired costume design is held up as a significant example of the Japanese influences on
Star Wars
.
[54]
It has long been rumored that the warrior on the front cover of
Wishbone Ash
's 1972 album
Argus
was the main inspiration behind Darth Vader. Vocalist and guitarist
Andy Powell
acknowledged this rumor although he himself cannot confirm if it is true as he had nothing to do with the conception of the cover art.
[55]
Portrayals
As Vader
David Prowse
physically portrayed Vader in the original film trilogy.
Darth Vader was portrayed by
bodybuilder
David Prowse
in the original film trilogy, with fencer
Bob Anderson
performing the character's
lightsaber
fight scenes.
[56]
[57]
George Lucas thought that the 6-foot-6-inch (1.98 m) Prowse "brought a physicality to Darth Vader that was essential for the character ... with an imposing stature and movement performance to match the intensity and undercurrent of Vader's presence."
[58]
Lucas chose to have a different actor be the voice of Vader, since Prowse had a strong
West Country English
accent that led the rest of the cast to nickname him "Darth Farmer". Lucas originally intended for
Orson Welles
to voice Vader, but after deciding that Welles's voice would be too recognizable, he cast the lesser-known
James Earl Jones
instead.
[59]
[60]
Jones initially felt his contributions to the films were too small to warrant recognition and his role was uncredited at his request until the release of
Return of the Jedi
(1983).
[56]
When Jones was specifically asked if he had supplied Vader's voice for
Revenge of the Sith
—either newly or from a previous recording—Jones answered, "You'd have to ask Lucas about that. I don't know."
[61]
Hayden Christensen
and Gene Bryant alternately portray Vader in
Revenge of the Sith
.
[62]
[63]
[64]
[aa]
During the production of
Revenge of the Sith
, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by Prowse.
[65]
Brock Peters
provided the voice of Darth Vader in the
NPR/USC radio series
. Both
Spencer Wilding
[66]
and Daniel Naprous portrayed Vader in
Rogue One
(2016), with Jones reprising his role as the character's voice.
[67]
[68]
James Earl Jones
voiced Darth Vader for the character's portrayals in film and television.
Vader's character has also been portrayed in several
video games
; in games such as
Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire
and
Dark Forces
, visual effects artist C. Andrew Nelson appears in short sequences in the Vader costume, voiced by
Scott Lawrence
.
Matt Sloan
, who appeared in the YouTube parody
Chad Vader
, provided the voice of Darth Vader in
The Force Unleashed
.
[69]
As a result of his video game appearances, Nelson was cast to appear as Vader in brief sequences inserted into the
Special Edition
of
The Empire Strikes Back
, in which Vader is seen boarding his shuttle.
[64]
In September 2022, it was confirmed that Jones would retire from voicing the character. His voice was digitally recreated by the company
Respeecher
for use in
Obi-Wan Kenobi
using
artificial intelligence
, and Jones later signed over the rights to his performance for future
Star Wars
productions.
[70]
[71]
As Anakin
Hayden Christensen
portrayed Anakin Skywalker in the latter two episodes of the prequel trilogy and other minor film appearances. He would later take over portraying Vader as well in 2022.
During production of
Return of the Jedi
, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role of Anakin Skywalker since his death was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, and
Sebastian Shaw
was selected for the role.
[72]
[ab]
When Shaw arrived at the set for filming, he ran into his friend
Ian McDiarmid
, the actor playing the Emperor. When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there, Shaw responded, "I don't know, dear boy, I think it's something to do with science-fiction."
[74]
His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by
Richard Marquand
, was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue.
[72]
Lucas personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film, in which he plays Anakin's
Force spirit
. Shaw's likeness in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 DVD release. This attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together was one of the most controversial
changes in a
Star Wars
re-release
.
[75]
[76]
[aa]
Shaw received more fan mail and autograph requests from
Return of the Jedi
than he had for any role in the rest of his career. He later reflected that he enjoyed his experience on the film and expressed particular surprise that an
action figure
was made of his portrayal.
[72]
When
The Phantom Menace
was being produced, hundreds of actors were tested for the role of young Anakin
[78]
before the producers settled on
Jake Lloyd
, who Lucas considered met his requirements of "a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic". Producer
Rick McCallum
said that Lloyd was "smart, mischievous and loves anything mechanical—just like Anakin."
[79]
[80]
During production of
Attack of the Clones
, casting director Robin Gurland reviewed about 1,500 other candidates for the role of the young Anakin before Lucas eventually selected Hayden Christensen for the role,
[81]
reportedly because he and
Natalie Portman
(the actress who plays Padmé Amidala) "looked good together".
[82]
When
Revenge of the Sith
was being produced, Christensen and
Ewan McGregor
began rehearsing their climactic
lightsaber
duel long before Lucas would shoot it. They trained extensively with stunt coordinator
Nick Gillard
to memorize and perform their duel together. As in the previous prequel film, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles.
[83]
Anakin has also been voiced by
Mat Lucas
for the 2003 micro-series
Clone Wars
, and by
Matt Lanter
in the
CGI
animated film
The Clone Wars
, the
television series of the same name
and for Anakin's small roles in the animated series
Rebels
and
Forces of Destiny
.
[84]
James Earl Jones reprised the voice role for Vader's appearances in
Rebels
.
[85]
[86]
Both Lanter and Jones contributed their voices for the second-season finale of
Rebels
, at times with identical dialogue spoken by both actors blended together in different ways.
[87]
Characteristics
In
Attack of the Clones
, Anakin Skywalker feels "smothered" by Obi-Wan Kenobi and is incapable of controlling his own life.
[88]
By
Revenge of the Sith
, however, his "father-son" friction with his master has matured into a more equal, brotherly relationship.
[89]
Once he becomes Darth Vader, each evil act he commits shatters any hope or connection towards his previous life, which makes it harder for him to return to the light,
[90]
but he ultimately escapes the dark side and redeems himself by sacrificing his life to save his son, Luke Skywalker, and kill the Emperor in
Return of the Jedi
.
[91]
Eric Bui, a
psychiatrist
at
University of Toulouse
Hospital, argued at the 2007
American Psychiatric Association
convention that Anakin Skywalker meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria for
borderline personality disorder
(BPD), one more than necessary for a diagnosis. He and a colleague, Rachel Rodgers, published their findings in a 2010 letter to the editor of the journal
Psychiatry Research
. Bui says he found Anakin Skywalker a useful example to explain BPD to medical students.
[92]
In particular, Bui points to Anakin's
abandonment issues
and uncertainty over his identity. Anakin's
mass murders
of the Tusken Raiders in
Attack of the Clones
and the young Jedi in
Revenge of the Sith
count as two
dissociative
episodes, fulfilling another criterion. Bui hoped his paper would help raise awareness of the disorder, especially among teens.
[92]
Appearances
Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker appears in seven of the live-action
Star Wars
films, the animated series
The Clone Wars
(including the film),
Rebels
, and the
micro-series
Clone Wars
and
Forces of Destiny
. He also has a main and recurring role in games, comics, books and the non-canon
Star Wars Legends
material.

X-wings
, but Solo intervenes and sends Vader's ship spiraling off course, allowing Luke to destroy the Death Star.
In
The Empire Strikes Back
, Vader becomes obsessed with finding the
Force
-sensitive Luke
[93]
and leads his
stormtroopers
to attack on the Rebel base on
Hoth
, but the Rebels escape. While conversing with
the Emperor
(
Ian McDiarmid
) via hologram, Vader convinces him that Luke would be a valuable ally if he could be turned to the
dark side of the Force
. Vader hires a group of
bounty hunters
to follow Luke's friends, and negotiates with
Bespin
administrator
Lando Calrissian
(
Billy Dee Williams
) to set a trap for them to bait Luke.
[93]
After Han, Leia,
Chewbacca
(

When Luke arrives, Vader overpowers him in a lightsaber duel, severing his hand. Vader tells Luke that he is his father, and tries to persuade him to join the dark side and help him overthrow the Emperor. Horrified, Luke escapes through an air shaft. Vader
telepathically
tells Luke that it is his destiny to join the dark side.
[93]
In
Return of the Jedi
, Vader and the Emperor supervise the final stages of the second Death Star's construction.
[93]
Thinking that there is still good in his father, Luke surrenders to Vader and tries to convince him to turn from the dark side. Vader takes Luke to the second Death Star to meet the Emperor. While there, the Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger, which leads to Vader dueling with Luke once again.
[93]
Realizing that Leia is Luke's twin sister, Vader threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Furious, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his father's cybernetic hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place. However, Luke refuses, and the Emperor tortures him with
Force lightning
. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader seizes the Emperor and throws him down a reactor shaft to his death, but is mortally wounded by his master's lightning in the process.
[93]
[94]
The redeemed Anakin Skywalker asks Luke to remove his mask, and admits that there was still good in him after all as he dies peacefully in his son's arms.
[94]
Luke escapes the second Death Star with his father's body and cremates it in a
pyre
on
Endor
. As the Rebels celebrate the second Death Star's destruction and the Empire's defeat, Luke sees the spirits of Anakin,
Yoda
(
Frank Oz

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
, which takes place 32 years before
A New Hope
, Anakin appears as a nine-year-old
slave
[33]
living on Tatooine with his mother
Shmi
(
Pernilla August
). In addition to being a gifted pilot and mechanic, Anakin has built his own protocol droid,
C-3PO
. Jedi Master
Qui-Gon Jinn
(
Liam Neeson
) meets Anakin after making an emergency landing on Tatooine with Queen of
Naboo
Padmé Amidala (
Natalie Portman
). Qui-Gon learns from Shmi that Anakin was
conceived without a father
and can
foresee the future
. Qui-Gon senses Anakin's strong connection to the Force and becomes convinced that he is the "Chosen One" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force. After winning his freedom in a
podrace
wager, Anakin leaves with Qui-Gon to be trained as a Jedi on
Coruscant
, but is forced to leave his mother behind. During the journey, Anakin forms a bond with Padmé. Qui-Gon asks the
Jedi Council
for permission to train Anakin, but they refuse, concerned that the fear he exhibits makes him vulnerable to the dark side. Eventually, Anakin helps end the corrupt
Trade Federation
's blockade of Naboo by destroying their control ship. After Qui-Gon is killed in a lightsaber duel with Sith Lord
Darth Maul
(portrayed by
Ray Park
, voiced by
Peter Serafinowicz
), he asks his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (
Ewan McGregor
) to train Anakin, which he does with the council's reluctant approval.
[94]
Palpatine, newly elected as the
Galactic Republic
's Chancellor, befriends Anakin and tells him he will "watch [his] career with great interest".
In
Episode II: Attack of the Clones
, which takes place 10 years after
The Phantom Menace
, 19-year-old Anakin is still Obi-Wan's Padawan apprentice. Over the years, he has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is holding him back. After rescuing Padmé, now a senator, from an assassination attempt, Anakin travels with her to Naboo as her bodyguard, and they fall in love, which is against the Jedi Code. Sensing that Shmi is in pain, Anakin travels with Padmé to Tatooine to rescue his mother. While there, Anakin learns that Shmi had been freed by and married farmer
Cliegg Lars
(
Jack Thompson
) a few years after he left. He then visits Cliegg and learns from him that she was kidnapped by
Tusken Raiders
. Anakin locates Shmi at a Tusken campsite, where she dies in his arms. Overcome with grief and rage, Anakin massacres the Tusken tribe and returns to the Lars homestead to bury Shmi.
[94]
Anakin then travels with Padmé to
Geonosis
to rescue Obi-Wan from Sith Lord
Count Dooku
(
Christopher Lee
). Dooku captures the trio and sentences them to death. However, a battalion of Jedi arrives with an army of
clone troopers
to halt the executions. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku, but the Sith Lord beats them both in a lightsaber duel and severs Anakin's arm. After being rescued by Yoda, Anakin is fitted with a robotic arm and marries Padmé in a secret ceremony.
In
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
, set three years after
Attack of the Clones
, Anakin is now a Jedi Knight and a hero of the
Clone Wars
. He and Obi-Wan lead a mission to rescue Palpatine from Separatist commander
General Grievous
(voiced by
Matthew Wood
). The two Jedi battle Count Dooku, whom Anakin overpowers and decapitates in cold blood at Palpatine's urging. They rescue Palpatine and return to Coruscant. Anakin reunites with Padmé, who tells him that she is pregnant. Although initially excited, Anakin soon begins to have nightmares about Padmé dying in childbirth.
[94]
Palpatine also appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his personal representative. Suspicious of Palpatine, the Council allows Anakin as a member, but declines to grant him the rank of Jedi Master and instead instructs him to spy on Palpatine, shaking  Anakin's faith in the Jedi. Later, Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war, and says that only he has the power to save Padmé from dying. Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to Jedi Master
Mace Windu
(
Samuel L. Jackson
), who confronts and subdues the Sith Lord. Desperate to save Padmé, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf and severs Windu's hand, allowing Palpatine to kill him.  Anakin then pledges himself to the Sith, and Palpatine dubs him Darth Vader.
[94]
On Palpatine's orders, Vader leads the
501st Legion
to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple, including the children, and then goes to the volcanic planet
Mustafar
to assassinate the Separatist Council. A distraught Padmé goes to Mustafar and pleads with Vader to abandon the dark side, but he refuses. Sensing Obi-Wan's presence, and thinking that they are conspiring to kill him, Vader angrily uses the Force to strangle Padmé to unconsciousness. Obi-Wan engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that ends with Obi-Wan severing Vader's limbs and leaving him for dead on the banks of a lava flow, where Vader sustains severe burns. Palpatine finds a barely alive Vader and takes him to Coruscant, where his mutilated body is treated and covered in the black suit first depicted in the original trilogy. When Vader asks if Padmé is safe, Palpatine says that he killed her out of anger, and Vader screams in agony. At the end of the film, Vader supervises the construction of the first Death Star alongside Palpatine and Tarkin (
Wayne Pygram
).
Jake Lloyd
played Anakin Skywalker as a child in
The Phantom Menace
, while
Hayden Christensen
played him as a young adult in the following two films. James Earl Jones reprised his role as the voice of Vader in
Revenge of the Sith
.
Sequel trilogy
Thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, Darth Vader's melted helmet appears in
The Force Awakens
(2015), in which Vader's grandson
Kylo Ren
(
Adam Driver
) - who has followed in his grandfather's footsteps by falling to the dark side and betraying the Jedi - is seen addressing him, though Vader does not appear in the film.
[ac]
At one point, his helmet was considered as the film's
MacGuffin
.
[95]
The helmet appears again in
The Rise of Skywalker
(2019), when Kylo briefly meditates with it, and during the film's first duel between Kylo and
Rey
(
Daisy Ridley
). The helmet is last seen on the planet
Kijimi
, which is later destroyed by a Sith
Star Destroyer
. The film also reveals that the voice which Ren perceived coming from Vader's helmet in
The Force Awakens
was generated by a resurrected Palpatine.
In
The Rise of Skywalker
, Anakin makes a vocal
cameo appearance
, along with other "voices of Jedi Past", where he encourages Rey to "bring back the balance... as [he] did" before she faces Palpatine and his Sith forces.
[96]
[97]
Palpatine uses the voice of Darth Vader to telepathically speak to Ren.
He is voiced by James Earl Jones as Vader and Hayden Christensen as Anakin.

(voiced by
Ashley Eckstein
) as Anakin's Padawan apprentice, a responsibility Anakin is at first reluctant to accept. Anakin calls her "Snips" for her "snippy" attitude, while Ahsoka calls him "Skyguy" as a pun on his surname.
[94]
After earning Anakin's respect during a dangerous mission, Ahsoka joins him on a quest to rescue
Jabba the Hutt
's infant son, Rotta. Her impetuousness both annoys and endears her to her master, and Anakin develops a friendly affection for his apprentice.
He is voiced by
Matt Lanter
.
Rogue One
In the anthology film
Rogue One
(2016), Darth Vader makes an appearance in which he summons
Orson Krennic
(
Ben Mendelsohn
), the Imperial Director of Advanced Weapons Research, to his castle on Mustafar. He confronts him about his handling of the Death Star project and the destruction of Jedha City, while Krennic asks Vader for an audience with the Emperor regarding the Death Star, which he lost command of to Tarkin. Vader refuses, ordering him to ensure that the Death Star project has not been compromised.
[98]
When Krennic asks him if he would still regain command of the Death Star, Vader uses the Force to choke him, telling him, "Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director."
[99]
At the end of the film, Vader boards the disabled Rebel flagship, the MC75 Star Cruiser
Profundity
, with a cadre of
501st Legion
troopers and kills several Rebel soldiers as he attempts to recover the plans. However, the docked blockade runner
Tantive IV
escapes with the plans, setting up the events of
A New Hope
.
Darth Vader had a much different role in early versions of the film's story. Screenwriter
Gary Whitta
stated that in his initial pitch, Vader would appear on
Scarif
and slaughter the Rebel blockade there.
[100]
In an earlier storyline, Vader would also have killed Krennic for his failure to prevent the Rebels from stealing the Death Star plans.
[101]
An image of a deleted scene featuring Vader was revealed in February 2021 by
Industrial Light & Magic
visual effects animator
Hal Hickel
, who added that Vader was supposed to have a conversation with Tarkin in that scene.
[102]
James Earl Jones also reprises his role from previous films as the voice of Darth Vader, who is physically portrayed by
Spencer Wilding
during the meeting with Krennic and aboard the Star Destroyer, and by Daniel Naprous for the end scene.
Television series
Clone Wars
(2003-2005)
Anakin is a lead character in all three seasons of the
Clone Wars
micro-series, which takes place shortly after the conclusion of
Attack of the Clones
. Anakin becomes a Jedi Knight and is quickly promoted to a General of the Republic's Clone Army, due in part to Palpatine's (voiced by
Nick Jameson
) influence. Among other missions, he fights a duel with Dooku's apprentice
Asajj Ventress
(voiced by
Grey DeLisle
), helps Obi-Wan (voiced by
James Arnold Taylor
) capture a Separatist-controlled fortress and rescues Jedi Master
Saesee Tiin
(voiced by
Dee Bradley Baker
) during a space battle. During the third season, Anakin frees a planet's indigenous species from Separatist control and sees a cryptic vision of his future as Darth Vader. In the series finale, Anakin and Obi-Wan go on a mission to rescue Palpatine from General Grievous, leading to the opening of
Revenge of the Sith
.
He is voiced by
Mat Lucas
as an adult and Frankie Ryan Mariquez as a child.
The Clone Wars
(2008-2014, 2020)
Anakin is a lead character in all seasons of
The Clone Wars
. As a Jedi Knight, he leads the
501st Legion
on missions with both his master Obi-Wan and apprentice Ahsoka Tano throughout the war. Some of Anakin's actions taken out of concern for Ahsoka violate the Jedi code, such as torturing prisoners who may know her location when she goes missing.
[103]
Throughout the series there are several references to Anakin's eventual fall to the dark side, including visions of his future as Darth Vader in the third season, and disillusion with the Jedi Council after they wrongly accuse Ahsoka of bombing the Jedi Temple in the fifth season. While she is later forgiven after the true culprit is found, she nonetheless chooses to leave the Jedi Order.
[104]
Anakin appears as Vader in the final scene of the series finale, set some time after
Revenge of the Sith
. He investigates the crash site of the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Tribunal
, which was destroyed during
Order 66
. Finding one of Ahsoka's lightsabers among the wreckage, Vader assumes that his former Padawan has perished and leaves in silence.
Matt Lanter reprised his role as Anakin from the movie.
Rebels
(2014-2018)
Darth Vader appears in
Star Wars Rebels
, which takes place 14 years after
The Clone Wars
concluded. He makes minor appearances throughout the first season, and serves as the main antagonist for most of the second season.
[105]
At the beginning of the series, Vader leads a squadron of Force-sensitive
Imperial Inquisitors
who actively search for and kill any remaining Jedi and Force-sensitive children. In the first season, he dispatches
the Grand Inquisitor
to hunt a Rebel cell causing trouble for the Empire on
Lothal
, and personally arrives on Lothal to deal with the Rebel threat after the Inquisitor is killed. In the second-season premiere, Vader orchestrates the murder of Imperial Minister Maketh Tua, who tried to defect to the Rebellion, and confronts the Jedi
Kanan Jarrus
and
Ezra Bridger
. When he later attacks the fleet of the Phoenix Squadron, Vader discovers that Ahsoka is still alive and has joined the Rebel Alliance,
[106]
while Ahsoka is overwhelmed when she recognizes Anakin under "a layer of hate" in Darth Vader. The Emperor orders Vader to dispatch another Inquisitor to capture her.
[42]
Later in the season, Ahsoka has a vision in which Anakin blames her for allowing him to fall to the dark side. In the season finale, Ahsoka duels with her former master inside a Sith Temple, allowing her friends to escape Vader and the temple's destruction. As the episode concludes, Vader escapes from the temple's ruins while Ahsoka's fate is left unknown. Vader makes a final voiceless cameo in the late fourth-season episode "A World Between Worlds", in which it is revealed that Ahsoka escaped from her previous duel with Vader by entering a Force-realm that exists outside of time and space. Shortly afterward, Vader's voice (archival audio from
Return of the Jedi
) is heard echoing in the void.
Matt Lanter reprised his role from
The Clone Wars
as Anakin and James Earl Jones as Vader. Both Lanter and Jones contributed their voices for the second-season finale, at times with identical dialogue spoken by both actors blended together in different ways.
Forces of Destiny
(2017-2018)
Anakin Skywalker appears in multiple episodes of the 2D animated online micro-series
Forces of Destiny
[84]
with Matt Lanter reprising his role.
Obi-Wan Kenobi
(2022)
Hayden Christensen returned as Darth Vader, both in and out of armor, in the
Disney+
streaming series
Obi-Wan Kenobi
[107]
with Dimitrious Bistrevesky serving as performance artist for the character, while
James Earl Jones
returns to voice the character. The series reveals that for a decade after their duel on Mustafar, Obi-Wan believed his fallen apprentice to be dead, only for the Imperial Inquisitor Reva to reveal to him that Anakin Skywalker is alive.
[108]
After Reva draws out Kenobi, Vader begins hunting his former master, seeking to exact revenge on Kenobi for the injuries he inflicted upon him back on Mustafar. Christensen also returns in flashback sequences, both as a newly minted Darth Vader carrying out the massacre at the Jedi Temple, and as Padawan Anakin Skywalker, training with Kenobi in the years preceding the Clone Wars.
Ahsoka
(2023)
In October 2021,
The Hollywood Reporter
reported that, according to undisclosed sources, Christensen would reprise his role as Anakin in the
Ahsoka
series, which is set after the original trilogy and scheduled for 2023.
[109]

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II
(2010), as the final boss.
Darth Vader makes a minor appearance at the end of
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
(2019), after the main antagonist, the Second Sister, is defeated. Vader kills the Second Sister for her failure to secure a Jedi Holocron that could lead the Empire to a number of Force-sensitive children, and then attempts to take the Holocron himself from the protagonist,
Cal Kestis
, who barely manages to escape from him. Vader returns as a boss in the sequel,
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
(2023), where he leads an Imperial assault on a Jedi hideout on the planet
Jedha
and duels Cere Junda, whom he manages to slay after a prolonged battle.
Both Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker have appeared as playable characters in every

In 2015, Marvel released a 25-issue series called
Darth Vader
(2015-16),
[121]
written by
Kieron Gillen
. It focuses on the Sith lord in the aftermath of the Death Star's destruction, as well as his life after learning about his son's existence,
[122]
and introduces franchise fan favorite character
Doctor Aphra
.
[123]
This series takes place parallel to the comic book series
Star Wars
, in which Vader and Luke meet;
[124]
the two series have a
crossover
titled
Vader Down
.
[125]
A continuation set between
The Empire Strikes Back
and
Return of the Jedi
debuted in 2020, written by
Greg Pak
.
[126]
The first few issues deal with Vader carrying out his revenge on those who concealed Luke; he also visits Padmé's tomb on Naboo and encounters her handmaidens.
[127]
A subsequent story arc depicts Vader being tested by the Emperor and incorporates elements created for
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[128]
[129]
The five-issue limited series
Obi-Wan & Anakin
(2016), written by
Charles Soule
, depicts the lives of the titular Jedi between
The Phantom Menace
and
Attack of the Clones
. At
New York Comic Con
2015, Soule described the story as "pretty unexplored territory".
[130]
Between 2017 and 2018, Soule wrote a prequel-era series, also called
Darth Vader
(sometimes subtitled
Dark Lord of the Sith
). It begins immediately after Vader wakes up in his armor at the end of
Revenge of the Sith
and explores his emotional transformation upon learning of Padmé's death, his adjustment to his mechanical suit, how he creates his red-bladed lightsaber, and his hunting of Jedi in the Inquisitor program (introduced in
Rebels
).
[131]
Its final arc, which deals with the construction of Vader's fortress on Mustafar, implies that Palpatine used the Force to conceive Anakin
in utero
,
[132]
as some had theorized that
Revenge of the Sith
indicates.
[133]
[ad]
A Lucasfilm story group member later clarified that "This is all in Anakin's head".
[135]

A five-issue limited series written by
Dennis Hopeless
,

, behind
Hannibal Lecter
and
Norman Bates
.
[150]
His role as a
tragic hero
in the saga has also met with positive reviews.
[151]
[152]
Contrarily, in 1977, a
New Journal and Guide
writer criticized the lack of racial diversity in the original
Star Wars
film, pointing out that "the force of evil ... is dressed in all black and has the voice of a black man."
[153]
George Lucas felt hurt at such accusations.
[154]
Psychiatrists have considered Vader to be a useful example for explaining
borderline personality disorder

Darth Vader grotesque
on the northwest tower of the
Washington National Cathedral
(
Episcopal Church
) in
Washington, D.C.
Many films and television series have paid homage to Darth Vader. The 1982 movie
Cosmic Princess
, compiled from parts of
Space: 1999
episodes, contains several
Star Wars
references including a character named "Vader".
[158]
Marty McFly
in
Back to the Future
(1985), dressed in a
radiation suit
, calls himself "Darth Vader from the planet
Vulcan
" in one scene. Vader is parodied as "Dark Helmet" (
Rick Moranis
) in the
Star Wars
parody
Spaceballs
(1987). A primary antagonist in
Final Fantasy IV
(1991) was stated by game creator
Takashi Tokita
to be based on Vader.
[159]
In
Chasing Amy
(1997), Hooper X (
Dwight Ewell
) speaks at a comic book convention about Darth Vader being a metaphor for how poorly the science fiction genre treats Black people; he is especially offended that Vader, the "Blackest brother in the galaxy", reveals himself to be a "feeble, crusty old white man" at the end of
Return of the Jedi
. Vader, especially his role as a father, is parodied as
Emperor Zurg
in
Toy Story 2
.
[160]
The character of Dark Mayhem in
The Thundermans
is also a parody of Vader, especially in his original depiction. The
Warner Bros.
animated show
Loonatics Unleashed
has a
Sylvester the Cat
-type character named Sylth Vester, a play on Vader and his name.
Chewing lice; the one on the right, with a Vader-esque head, is

Ottawa Senators
goaltender
Martin Gerber
performed so well in an all-black mask that fans endearingly termed him "Darth Gerber".
[169]
Many commentators and comedians have also evoked Vader's visage to
satirize
politicians and other public figures, and several American political figures have been unflatteringly compared to the character. In response to
Ronald Reagan
's proposed
Strategic Defense Initiative
(dubbed "Star Wars" by his political opponents), German news magazine
Der Spiegel
portrayed the president wearing Vader's helmet on its cover in 1984.
[170]
In 2005,
Al Gore
referred to
Tele-Communications Inc.
's
John C. Malone
as the "Darth Vader of cable",
[171]
and political strategist
Lee Atwater
was known by his political enemies as "the Darth Vader of the
Republican Party

In 2006, while discussing the
war on terror
, US Vice President
Dick Cheney
stated, "I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of
the administration
.'"
[175]
In January 2007,
Jon Stewart
put on a Vader helmet to address Cheney as a "kindred spirit" on
The Daily Show
.
[176]
Cheney's wife,
Lynne
, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader
action figure
on her October 2007 appearance on the show. Both Stewart and
Stephen Colbert
have occasionally referred to Cheney as "Darth Cheney". In the
satirical
cartoon show
Lil' Bush
, Cheney's father is portrayed as Vader. At a presidential campaign event in September 2007,
Hillary Clinton
also referred to Cheney as Vader. At the 2008 Washington
Radio and Television Correspondents' Association
Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife told him that the Vader comparison "humanizes" him. In 2009, George Lucas stated that Cheney is more akin to Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be
George W. Bush
.
[177]
An issue of
Newsweek
referenced this quote, and compared Bush and Cheney to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various
Star Wars
and
Star Trek
characters.

An Iraqi
Fedayeen Saddam
helmet in the
Army Flying Museum

[189]
On December 2, 2020, a figurine of Vader appeared on the plinth where the
statue of Edward Colston

full of water. The crew had left the yacht and was taken safely on board the
light ship
. She took the crew off the light ship and towed the yacht safely into

[6]
On Oct 14, 1886, the pilot boat
Gracie
was cruising off the

bar off the coast of
North Carolina
when she sighted a steamer signaling for a pilot. In rough weather, three men left the
Gracie
in a
yawl
that capsized before reaching the vessel. The men were rescued by the pilot boat but Charlie St. George almost sank before being able to catch a rope and be pulled on board.

]
Angell studied sculpture at the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago
and while in Chicago did some designing, and likely modeling, for the American Terra Cotta Company and the Ceramic Company. In 1922, he and his wife Gladys moved to Ann Arbor when he was hired by the
University of Michigan
to teach freehand drawing. In 1926 he became the Museums Artist where he created, among things, plaster models of various animals, many of them prehistoric, that were used in the museum's displays. In the course of his 30 years at the University of Michigan he also created numerous portraits and busts and plaques of U of M notables, and these can be found spread all over the university campus.

1893 royal wedding
Wedding of Prince George and Princess Victoria Mary
Prince George and Princess Mary on their wedding day
Date
6 July 1893
; 130 years ago
(
6 July 1893
)
Venue
Chapel Royal
,
St. James's Palace
Location
London
, England
Participants
Prince George, Duke of York
(later King George V)
Princess Victoria Mary of Teck
(later Queen Mary)
On 6 July 1893, Prince George, Duke of York (later
King George V
), and Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (later
Queen Mary
) were married at the
Chapel Royal
,
St. James's Palace
, in
London
, England.
Engagement
[
edit
]
Princess Victoria Mary of Teck's engagement to
Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale
, eldest son of the
Prince of Wales
, ended with the duke's death on 14 January 1892.
[1]
Even before the duke's death, his grandmother
Queen Victoria
had wanted to ensure the succession, and consequently desired that his younger brother and (now second-in-line to the throne)
Prince George
marry either
Princess Marie
or
Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh
. For his part, George was fond of his cousins, but did not want to marry early; "I still think marrying too young is a bad thing," he wrote to the Queen, and cited the circumstances surrounding the death of
Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria
, as an example. Furthermore, the prince made it known, "The one thing I never could do is to marry a person that didn't care for me. I should be miserable for the rest of my life".
[2]
In 1892 however, a tentative proposal of marriage was put forward to Marie's parents, but as she was influenced by her Anglophobe mother and governess, Marie rejected him.
[3]
His grandmother
Queen Victoria
was fond of the Duke of Clarence's fiancée, and made known her wish for Mary to wed his brother George (now the
Duke of York
). The situation was embarrassing for the couple, as the country expected their engagement and contemporary newspapers speculated wildly on the affair. Mary was still mourning the duke's death, but faced the intense pressure of her parents, among others.
[4]
George on the other hand was faced with the reality of his new position as second-in-line to the throne, and had lost self-confidence after Marie's refusal.
[5]
He had no idea what Mary's real opinion was towards him, and consequently had some misgivings; George was urged to propose to Mary after spending time with his beloved aunt
Queen Olga of the Hellenes
.
[6]
Despite this background, the couple came to care deeply for each other, and their marriage would be a success.
Several awkward encounters with Prince George went by, always in the company of others, with both individuals remaining embarrassed and shy. On 3 May 1893, Mary arranged to have tea with George's sister
Princess Louise, Duchess of Fife
, and
her husband
, but when she arrived, she found George there as well. The awkward moment was saved after Louise interceded, "Now Georgie, don't you think you ought to take May into the garden to look at the frogs in the pond?" George proposed beside the pond, and their engagement was officially announced the following day.
[7]
Protests
[
edit
]
The
Socialist League
, an anarchist group, campaigned against the cost of the wedding, putting up posters which stated: "The London Anarchists will hold an indignation meeting Sunday, July 2nd, in Hyde Park, at half-past-three, to protest against the waste of wealth upon these Royal Vermin, while the workers are dying of hunger and overwork.  Fellow workers, prepare for the Revolution.  Remember - He who would be free himself must strike the blow.  Down with Flunkyism."
Thomas Cantwell
and Ernest Young, members of the group, were caught
flyposting
and were arrested and held in prison.  Their offices were searched, but the case was ultimately dismissed.
[8]
Wedding
[
edit
]
Combined coat of arms of George and Mary, the Duke and Duchess of York
Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Victoria Mary of Teck were married at 12:30 on 6 July 1893 at the
Chapel Royal
at
St James's Palace
.
[9]
[10]
Their wedding was the first royal wedding to take place in St James's Chapel since the death of
Prince Albert
in 1861, which plunged Queen Victoria into deep mourning. Most of Albert and Victoria's own children were married in
St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle
, in relative seclusion.
[11]
On the morning of their wedding, George accidentally caught sight of his fiancée down a long corridor of
Buckingham Palace
; he proceeded to make a "low and courtly bow," a gesture Mary never forgot.
[12]
The royal parties were brought from Buckingham Palace to St James's in four large carriage processions, consisting of open
landaus
. The first procession included members of the household; this was followed by the Duke of York and his supporters in the second and Princess Mary, the Duke of Teck and Prince Adolphus of Teck in the third. The final procession included Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Teck and Princes Frederick and Alexander of Teck.
[9]
[13]
The first public royal wedding in 32 years drew large numbers of spectators, many of whom gathered in the route from
Buckingham Palace
to St James's Palace to give the couple an "enthusiastic reception".
[11]
Mary greeted the crowds' applause with her "side-ways smile," and with "a little nervous gesture of her white-gloved right hand".
[14]
[9]
[15]
[16]
Princess Victoria Mary was attended by five bridesmaids and five junior bridesmaids:
[11]
George's sisters Princesses
Victoria
and
Maud of Wales
; and his first cousins Princesses
Victoria Melita
,
Alexandra
, and
Beatrice of Edinburgh
; Princesses
Margaret
and
Patricia of Connaught
; Princesses
Alice
and
Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg
; and
Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein
.
[12]
The Duke of York's two supporters were the
Prince of Wales
and the
Duke of Edinburgh
.
[9]
The
Archbishop of Canterbury
performed the ceremony, and was assisted by the
Bishop of London
, the
Bishop of Rochester
, and five other
prelates
. George and Mary then proceeded to
Buckingham Palace
, where Queen Victoria made a rare public appearance on the balcony along with the Duke and Duchess.
[11]
The marriage register was signed by the Queen, the prime minister, and all other royal personages present.
[16]
Upon their marriage, Mary became styled as
Her Royal Highness
The Duchess of York. They spent their honeymoon at
Sandringham
, the Prince of Wales' estate in
Norfolk
,
[16]
before going to
Osborne House
to stay with the Queen.

Wedding dress
[

Main article:
Wedding dress of Princess Victoria Mary of Teck
Painting of the wedding by Danish artist
Laurits Tuxen
.
Upon the announcement of the engagement,
Arthur Silver
of the
Silver Studio
, was approached to design the wedding dress. Silver had designed the dress for Princess Mary's intended wedding to the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1892. This 'Lily of the Valley' creation had been made public just days before the Duke of Clarence's untimely death in January 1892 but had to be completely abandoned.
[17]
The design chosen for the York-Teck wedding was 'The May Silks'; the dress would feature embroidery of the emblems of a
rose
,
shamrock
and
thistle
, and be trimmed with the traditional orange blossom and true lovers knots.
[18]
The dress itself was put together by Linton and Curtis of
Albemarle Street
, London.
[19]
The front of the dress was made of white satin, featuring three small flounces old
Honiton lace
which had been used on the wedding dress of her mother.
[

]
The bodice, cut at the throat, was long and pointed and was made of white and silver brocade, also featuring a small amount of her mother's Honiton lace near the top and on the upper part of the sleeve.
[20]
[21]
The veil, previously used by her mother was fastened with diamond pins gifted by Queen Victoria.
[

]
Matching the orange blossom elements to the dress, small wreaths were placed all the way around the bust and on the hair. Princess Mary completed the wedding outfit with a diamond
tiara
from Queen Victoria; diamond rivière necklace from the Prince and Princess of Wales; and diamond earrings and anchor brooch, a wedding gift from Prince George.

Traditional song
"
The Butcher and the Tailor's Wife
" also known as "
Benjamin Bowmaneer
" (
Roud
#1528) is a
traditional English folk song
.
It dates from the mid-17th century and exists in several versions, for example "The Tailor's Breeches", "The Tailor and the Louse", "The Bold Trooper",
[1]
and "The Trooper and the Tailor".
[2]
In all versions the
tailor
suffers a variety of humiliating indignities.
Synopsis
[
edit
]
In a version sung by
Nic Jones
, the tailor is a cowardly man dominated by his wife. She goes to the butcher for a joint of meat and hatches a plan whereby her husband is to hide under the bed with a sword while she lies with the butcher, explaining that, by doing this, her husband might become a rich butcher himself. When the time arrives the butcher sees the tailor's leg and, thinking it belongs to a dog, announces that he will fire a gunshot to scare it away. On hearing this the tailor leaps up and says that, if the butcher spares his life, he can have his wife.
In other versions, the wife is replaced by a louse and with whom the tailor goes to battle. Eventually, and despite many humiliating reverses witnessed by tinker, broom-makers and beggars, the tailor emerges victorious, but it is a pyrrhic victory.

Galt
is a community in
Cambridge, Ontario
, Canada, in the
Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario
on the
Grand River
. Prior to 1973, it was an independent city, incorporated in 1915, but amalgamation with the village of
Hespeler
, the town of
Preston
and the village of Blair formed the new municipality of Cambridge. Being the largest constituent community in the city, it is also seen as the downtown core of Cambridge.
[1]
The first mayor of Cambridge was
Claudette Millar
.
There was considerable resistance among the local population to this "shotgun marriage" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Even today, many residents identify Galt, Preston, and Hespeler as still being cities or towns in their own right. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives.
[2]
No current population data is available for the former Galt since the Census reports cover only the full area of Cambridge.
The former Galt covers the largest portion of the amalgamated municipality, making up the southern half of the city. It is located on the
Grand River
and has a very long history as an industrialized area. The former Preston and Blair are located on the western side of the city, while the former Hespeler is in the most northeasterly section of Cambridge.
History
[
edit

32 Cedar Street West Galt, Cambridge
Old Post Office in Galt (Cambridge) built in 1886, renovated in 2016. (2010 photo)
In the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the Six Nations Indians who were led by Joseph Brant. One speculator,
William Dickson
, a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, bought 90,000 acres (360 km
2
) of land along the
Grand River
in 1816; this was later to become Galt and the Dumfries Townships. Dickson divided the land and advertised in Scotland for immigrants; many were attracted and arrived in what is now Galt, primarily from
Roxburghshire
and
Selkirkshire
. Dickson sold lots to these new settlers. The centre of the planned community was at the junction of Mill Creek and the Grand River, then called Shade's Mills.
[3]
Absalom Shade
, a carpenter from Pennsylvania, was hired in 1816 by William Dickson to manage his lands in Dumfries Township. He later operated a general store, a mill and a distillery in Shade's Mills, which later became Galt. In 1819, he built a small bridge over the Grand River to serve customers on the other side; it lasted until 1832.
[4]
Shade also supplied food and built roads for the Canada Company. He helped establish the
Grand River Navigation Company
to help transport goods along the river, as well as the
Gore Bank
in Hamilton. Shade also helped develop railways in the area and was among those who built Galt's Trinity Anglican Church in 1844.

Dickson decided to name the Post Office Galt, in honour of
John Galt
of the
Canada Company
which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s. Galt was incorporated as a village in 1850, as a town in 1857 and as a city in 1915.
[7]
Throughout that entire period, it continued to grow based on a large industrial base.
[8]
The Canadian Gazetteer of 1846 discussed the community's water power which was essential to power the local industries which were making the area prosperous. At the time the population was about 1000, most originally from Scotland. There were five churches, a weekly newspaper, a fire department, a public library, a bank and a curling club. The post office received mail every day. Industries already in operation included "two grist mills (each containing four run of stones), two saw mills, two foundries, two carding machines and cloth factories, one brewery, two distilleries, one tannery..."
[9]
A foundry had also opened on Grand Avenue, initially as Dumfries Foundry which would later become
Goldie & McCulloch
, a major manufacturer of safes, wood working machinery and engines powered by steam or by gasoline. It would continue as a major operation under several other owners until 2000.
[10]
[11]
The largest of the early schools in the community, the Galt Grammar School, opened in 1852 with William Tassie as headmaster starting in 1853 at the site of what later became the Galt Collegiate. The school gained widespread recognition and attracted students from across North America. By 1872, it had been recognized as a Collegiate Institute.
[12]
Galt incorporated as a town on January 1, 1857, with Morris C. Lutz elected as the first mayor. By 1858, a "Town Hall and Market House" had been built with an "Italianate", particularly Tuscan, influence. In later years, the Town Hall became the City Hall and was extensively modified.
[12]
Galt was incorporated as a city in 1915.
The population in 1869 was 4000 and the community was said to be one of the principal manufacturing locations in Ontario.
[13]
The railway reached Galt in 1879, increasing the opportunities of exporting local goods and importing others.
[14]
In 1889, the former Dickson Mill on the Grand River was converted to a hydro electric plant which operated until July 1911 when a power grid from Niagara Falls reached the community.
[15]
An interurban streetcar connected Galt to Hespeler and nearby Preston.
In the early 1870s, the
Credit Valley Railway
planned to implement several lines running west and north from Toronto and in 1873, built freight and passenger buildings in Galt. By 1879, the company had installed a bridge crossing the river and in December completed a preliminary test run with a train; it was successful. The CVR venture was not long-lived however, and in 1883, the line was taken over by the
Canadian Pacific Railway
which built a brick passenger building that still stands.
[16]
A new streetcar system, the
Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway
, (later called the Grand River Railway Company) would begin operation in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.
[17]
[18]
The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955.
Not long after Galt had become part of Cambridge, in May 1974, flooding on the
Grand River
filled city streets with water to a depth of about four feet. In some areas of the downtown core, the depth was 17.4 feet, smashing windows and carrying goods along the streets. Approximately 75 businesses were affected, with virtually none covered by relevant insurance. The flood caused an estimated $5 million in damage.
[19]
[20]
The Dickson Hill Heritage Conservation District,
[21]
also known as Old West Galt, is an affluent neighbourhood full of stately homes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, found on the western side of the Grand River in West Galt.
[22]
Government
[
edit
]
The local government is the
Cambridge City Council
consisting of a mayor and eight councillors, each representing a
ward
.
Region of Waterloo Headquarters in Kitchener
Cambridge is also represented on the higher-tier Waterloo Regional Council which consists of the Regional Chair, the Mayors of the seven cities and townships, and eight additional Councilors - four from Kitchener and two each from Cambridge and Waterloo. Ken Seiling has held the position of Regional Chair since 1985.
[23]
[24]
Cambridge is represented in Ottawa by
Bryan May
(Liberal), the federal member of Parliament who defeated the previous incumbent
MP
(
Gary Goodyear
, Conservative - 2004 to 2015) in the October 2015 election.
The
MPP
for Cambridge is
Brian Riddell
of the
Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario
, who was first elected to this position in 2022.
Municipal services
[
edit
]
Galt was an independent city in
Waterloo County, Ontario
until 1973 when amalgamation created the
Regional Municipality of Waterloo
. At that time, Galt was amalgamated into the new city of Cambridge. The Region handles many services, including Police, waste management, community health, transit, recreation, planning, roads and social services.
[25]
The Region consists of the cities of Cambridge,
Kitchener
, and
Waterloo
, and the townships of
Woolwich
,
Wilmot
,
Wellesley
, and
North Dumfries
.
Public transportation
[
edit
]
Since 2000, local and regional transit throughout the
Region of Waterloo
has been provided by
Grand River Transit
(GRT), which was created by a merger of the former
Cambridge Transit
and
Kitchener Transit
.
The
Grand River Transit
200 iXpress bus in downtown Galt in 2015. Within Cambridge, the route has since been replaced by the 302 ION Bus.
GRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge, four of which travel outside of the city: presently the 52, 61, and 72 buses run to southern
Kitchener
.
The
Ainslie St. Transit Terminal
in Galt was the southern terminus of GRT's original iXpress route (later rebranded as the 200 iXpress after the addition of more routes), which ran through all three cities in the Region of Waterloo before terminating in the north at the Conestoga Mall terminal (later renamed
Conestoga station
) in Waterloo. The route was launched in 2005 as a part of the Regional Growth Management Strategy, which called for greater densification of urban cores, and was considered an intermediary step while more long-term rapid transit plans were still maturing.
[26]
In June 2009 Regional Council voted to approve a plan to construct a
light rail
line, which has been named
the
Ion rapid transit
.
[27]
The first phase would run from
Conestoga Mall
in the north of
Waterloo
, to
Fairview Park Mall
in the south of
Kitchener
, while the second phase of the line would run from Fairview Mall to the Galt area of Cambridge. Mayor Doug Craig was a determined opponent of the plan, arguing that an expanded express bus system would be just as effective but much less expensive.
[28]
[29]
By late February 2017, the Kitchener-Waterloo portion was well into the final phase of construction, but plans for the Cambridge section of the LRT were still in the very early stage. Public consultations were just getting started at the time. Three routes had been agreed on in 2011, with eight "endorsed" stops: at Fairway, Sportsworld, Preston, Pinebush, Cambridge Centre Mall, Can-Amera, Delta and Ainslie Street Terminal. Three others were still being considered.
[30]
As the launch of light rail service approached, Grand River Transit began to lay the groundwork for the transition from iXpress to Ion service by renaming the 200 iXpress to the 200 iXpress/ION Bus Rapid Transit.
[31]
On Monday, 24 June 2019, three days after the launch of Ion light rail between
Conestoga station
in Waterloo and
Fairway station
in Kitchener, the 200 iXpress route was discontinued. Its southern section running through Cambridge was replaced with the 302 ION Bus route, terminating in the north at Fairway station, with riders able to continue on the light rail system as a
linear transfer
.
[32]
As of June 2019, the Region of Waterloo planned for the 302 ION Bus to ultimately be replaced by an extension of the light rail line to Galt.
[33]
Education
[
edit
]
Galt Collegiate Institute, one of the oldest public high schools in Ontario.
Public English-language schooling is provided by the
Waterloo Region District School Board
, which operates 26 elementary and five secondary schools in Cambridge. The most notable high school is the
Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School
, which is over 150 years old.
Publicly funded Catholic education is available through schools operated by the
Waterloo Catholic District School Board
.
The
University of Waterloo School of Architecture
campus is located in Cambridge in the Riverside Silk Mill, also known as the Tiger Brand Building. Inside there is a theatre, a fitness room, and the gallery "Design at Riverside", which is one of two publicly funded galleries dedicated to architecture in Canada. The School of Architecture is home to 380 students who live, study, and learn within the Cambridge community.

Ellensburg
is a city in and the
county seat
of
Kittitas County
,
Washington
, United States. It is located just east of the
Cascade Range
near the junction of
Interstate 90
and
Interstate 82
. The population was 18,666 at the
2020 census
.
[3]
and was estimated to be 19,596 in 2021.
[4]
The city is located along the
Yakima River
in the
Kittitas Valley
, an agricultural region that extends east towards the
Columbia River
. The valley is a major producer of
timothy hay
, which is processed and shipped internationally. Ellensburg is also the home of
Central Washington University
(CWU).
Ellensburg, originally named Ellensburgh for the wife of town founder
John Alden Shoudy
, was founded in 1871 and grew rapidly in the 1880s following the arrival of the
Northern Pacific Railway
. The city was once a leading candidate to become the state capital of Washington, but its campaign was scuppered by a major fire in 1889.
History
[
edit
]
Barge Hall at Central Washington University
John Alden Shoudy
arrived in the
Kittitas Valley
in 1871 and purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson "A.J." Splawn, called "Robber's Roost". Robber's Roost was the first business in the valley, aside from the early trading that occurred among Native Americans, cattle drivers, trappers, and miners. A small stone monument to Robber's Roost with a placard can be found at its original location, present-day 3rd Avenue, just west of Main Street near the alley.
[6]
Shoudy named the new town after his wife, Mary Ellen, thus officially starting the city of Ellensburgh around 1872. Shoudy had not been the first settler nor the first business person in the
Kittitas Valley
, but he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh in the 1870s and also named the streets in the downtown district. Ellensburgh was officially incorporated on November 26, 1883. In 1894, the final -
h
was dropped under standardization pressure from the
United States Postal Service
and
Board of Geography Names
.
[7]
Ellensburg was an early center of commerce in Washington and was among the first cities in the state to have
electrical service
.
The city launched a bid to become Washington state's capital in 1889, preparing a site in the Capital Hill neighborhood for government offices. On July 4 that year, however, a major fire destroyed much of the downtown area and stalled the campaign, which resumed with a series of referendums, in which Washington voters chose
Olympia
.
[8]
The state legislature selected Ellensburg as the location for the State Normal School (now
Central Washington University
).
[9]
There were several early newspapers in Ellensburg.
The Daily Record
, which started in 1909, is the publication which serves the city and county today.
[10]
Concerns over the state of Ellensburg's historic downtown led to the formation of the Ellensburg Downtown Association to work on revitalizing the area.
[11]
Arts and culture
[

The City of Ellensburg has several local art museums and galleries:
Kittitas County Historical Museum
[12]
The Goodey Gallery
[13]
Clymer Museum and Gallery
[14]
Gallery One Visual Arts Center
[15]
420 Loft Art Gallery

[18]
Events
[
edit
]
The Ellensburg Farmers Market is held every Saturday from May to October in downtown Ellensburg.
[19]
Ellensburg hosts the annual Winterhop Brewfest in January. Over 21 micro breweries from around the
Pacific Northwest
serve their product at various venues in the downtown buildings.
[20]
[21]
Every June, Ellensburg hosts
Dachshunds
on Parade. Events include a parade, Dachshund races, pet tricks, and a dog costume contest.
[22]
Ellensburg hosts the annual Jazz in the Valley music festival on the last weekend in July.
[23]
Ellensburg is a stop on the
PRCA
professional
rodeo
circuit, occurring each year on Labor Day weekend. The
Ellensburg Rodeo
has been a town tradition since 1923, and is the largest rodeo in Washington state.
[10]
The rodeo arena is encompassed by the Kittitas County Fair, also held during Labor Day weekend. The Kittitas County Fair officially began in 1885, and has been held at its current location since 1923.
[24]
Downtown Ellensburg hosts Buskers in the Burg the last Saturday in September. It included street performers (buskers), giant puppet art parade, tasting halls, children's activities, and an outdoor evening concert.
[25]
Geography
[
edit
]
According to the
United States Census Bureau
, the city has a total area of 6.97 square miles (18.05 km
2
), of which 6.92 square miles (17.92 km
2
) is land and 0.05 square miles (0.13 km
2
) is water.
[26]
Climate
[
edit
]
Owing to the strong Cascade rain shadow, Ellensburg experiences a typical Intermountain
cool semi-arid climate
(
Köppen
BSk

Bottlegate incident
[

Main article:
Bottlegate
The most notable game from the 2001
Cleveland Browns
season came on a December 16 game against the
Jacksonville Jaguars
in what became known as "Bottlegate". The Browns were driving toward the east end zone for what would have been the winning score. A controversial call on fourth down gave the Jaguars the ball. Browns' receiver
Quincy Morgan
had caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 2. After
Tim Couch
spiked the ball on the next play, referee
Terry McAulay
reviewed Morgan's catch, claiming that the replay officials had buzzed him before Couch spiked the ball. (NFL Rules state that once the next play is started, the officials cannot under any circumstances review any previous plays.) Upon reviewing the play, McAulay determined that Morgan never had control of the ball, thus the pass was incomplete, and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. Fans in the
Dawg Pound
began throwing plastic beer bottles and other objects on the field.
[2]
McAulay declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms.
NFL Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue
then called to override the referee's decision, sending the players back onto the field, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.
[3]
After the game, McAulay clarified that they first reviewed whether or not the electronic pager had buzzed before Couch had spiked the ball. In a discussion with the Replay Official,
Bill Reynolds
, it was determined that Reynolds buzzed down before the spike. After the game was called, Tagliabue called NFL Supervisor
Dick McKenzie
and informed him that the game had to be finished to completion. Neither McAulay nor Reynolds suggested to Tagliabue that the game should be called, which was within the power of the Commissioner's Office. Davis would later comment that he was told that the buzzer went off at the same time as the snap. Couch had initially believed that the officials were going to penalize the Browns for
intentional grounding
for Couch faking a spike before spiking it, but was then told that the spike was legal. The referees then began discussing the play prior to the spike. President and Chief Executive Officer
Carmen Policy
refused to criticize the actions of the fans and the decisions of the officiating crew.

faculty
of
Moscow State University
.
History
[
edit
]
Although lectures in mathematics had been delivered since
Moscow State University
was founded in 1755, the mathematical and physical department was founded only in 1804.  The Mathematics and Mechanics Department was founded on 1 May 1933 and comprised mathematics,
mechanics
and astronomy departments (the latter passed to the Physics Department in 1956). In 1953 the department moved to a new building on the
Sparrow Hills
and the current division in mathematics and mechanics branches was settled. In 1970, the
Department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics
broke off the department due to the research in
computer science
.

[4]
Current state
[
edit
]
Today the Department comprises 26 chairs (17 in the mathematical and 9 in the mechanics branch) and 14 research laboratories. Around 350 professors, assistant professors and researchers work at the department. Around 2000 students and 450 postgraduates study at the department. The education lasts 5 years (6 years from 2011).

The Ancient Art of War in the Skies
is a
video game
developed by Evryware in 1992 for
MS-DOS
as a sequel to
The Ancient Art of War
and
The Ancient Art of War at Sea
. In 1993 conversions were published for
Amiga
and
Atari ST
.
Gameplay
[
edit
]
In
The Ancient Art of War in the Skies
, the player plays either the British or German forces in World War I. In this air combat simulation, the player makes aerial assaults against opponents such as
Lord Kitchener
,
Ferdinand Foch
,
Kaiser Wilhelm II
, fictional enemy Helmut von Spike, or even
Sun Tzu
.
[1]
The game acts in two dimensions. In the first one the player spends most of its time on the overhead map. They can plan the strategy and set the goals and routes for aircraft. In the second one, when the aircraft reaches its destination, the game switches to an arcade section. There are also two: a side-scrolling dog fights where the goal is to destroy the enemy aircraft shooting at them and overhead bombings where the player has to release bombs at the marked targets. Arcade sequences can be skipped and dealt by computer's calculations based on different variables.
Reception
[
edit
]
The game was reviewed in 1993 in
Dragon
#190 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.
[1]
Computer Gaming World
called it "a cute combination of strategy and action gaming" that would not likely appeal to fans of flight simulators or wargames.
[2]
A 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave the game three-plus stars out of five.

Type of firewall in computing
A
circuit-level gateway
is a type of
firewall
.
Circuit-level gateways work at the
session layer
of the
OSI model
, or as a "shim-layer" between the
application layer
and the
transport layer
of the
TCP/IP
stack. They monitor TCP handshaking between packets to determine whether a requested session is legitimate. Information passed to a remote computer through a circuit-level gateway appears to have originated from the gateway. Firewall traffic is cleaned based on particular session rules and may be controlled to acknowledged computers only. Circuit-level firewalls conceal the details of the protected network from the external traffic, which is helpful for interdicting access to impostors. Circuit-level gateways are relatively inexpensive and have the advantage of hiding information about the private network they protect. However, they do not filter individual packets.

Gameplay
[
edit
]
The game plays similarly to the board game
Monopoly
[4]
and
party game
Mario Party
.
[5]
Mini games
occur in the game, although they are not the main focus, and many are either based on
luck
or very simple interactions.
[6]
In the game, the player selects a character, of which originates from a
Final Fantasy
or
Dragon Quest
video game, and directs them through a game board by taking turns in rolling
dice
.
[7]
When a character lands on an open space, they may purchase it to be their own, and when another player stops on it, they must pay a fee to the character who owns it.
[7]
Other spaces allow various other actions for the player to choose to participate in with their money as well, including the option to
invest
them in a
stock market
, keep money safe in
banks
, or
gamble
money in a
casino
.
[8]
The end goal is to either bankrupt all other players, or earn a preset amount of money.
[7]
Winning games leads to earning "coins", which in turn, can be used to unlock extra characters or boards.
[8]
Characters
[
edit
]
The game contains 16 different playable characters at the game's start; eight from
Final Fantasy
, and eight from
Dragon Quest
.
[8]
An additional eight, four from each franchise, can be unlocked upon accomplishing various feats in the game.

Development
[
edit
]
The game was first announced in a February 2006 issue of
Shonen Jump
magazine,
[9]
for a release in "Spring 2006".
[10]
While the game was designed to look and play similarly to
Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Special
, it is not a port, but rather a new game with more boards and characters.
[9]
The game was released in Japan on May 25, 2006, but not in any other regions.
[1]
The game was released as Square Enix's
Ultimate Hits
with
Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth
on March 6, 2008 in Japan.
[11]
Reception
[
edit
]
The game received mixed reviews.
IGN
felt it was a solid game that didn't use its licenses well, stating that it "stands on its own without the
Dragon Quest
and
Final Fantasy
connection...Square Enix's two biggest franchises don't really add much to the experience. While it's nice seeing your favorite
Final Fantasy
and
Dragon Quest
characters...the licenses aren't put to use as well as one would expect of a true crossover game (see
Smash Bros
for an example)".
[7]
Conversely, Siliconera recommended it more for fans of the respective series,
Final Fantasy
and
Dragon Quest
, than for fans of party games, opining that "...when the game was conceived it was designed with fans of Square Enix titles in mind. Instead of improving on the
Itadaki
formula, the game makes its mark mainly because of the mascot characters. As a party game...you're more likely to turn it off after a few turns in favor of a faster party game."
[6]
In a later playtest by Siliconera comparing the two
handheld video game console
versions of the game at the time,
Itadaki Street Portable
and
Nintendo DS iteration
of the series, and came to the conclusion that "
Itadaki Street Portable
is really best for mature gamers with a lot of friends who live nearby and are willing to also invest in a copy to play.
Itadaki Street DS
is more of a general audiences title, where anyone could pick it up, play and enjoy".
[12]
In Japanese, magazine
Famitsu
give game a 32/40.
The game sold relatively well, being the fourth best-selling game in Japan in its release week,
[13]
and staying in the top ten the following week as well.
[1]
However, sales stalled around 110,000 copies sold, far less than the iteration
Itadaki Street
for PlayStation 2, which sold over 380,000 copies, or the Nintendo DS iteration, which sold over 413,000 copies.
[14]
The Ultimate Hits version has sold about 40,000 copies.

; born October 28, 1957)
[1]
is an American
pediatrician
who has served as the United States
assistant secretary for health
since March 26, 2021.
[2]
She is also an
admiral
in the
United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps
.
Levine is a professor of
pediatrics
and
psychiatry
at the
Penn State College of Medicine
, and previously served as the Pennsylvania physician general from 2015 to 2017 and as secretary of the
Pennsylvania Department of Health
from 2017 to 2021.
[3]
Levine is one of only a few
openly
transgender
government officials in the United States,
[4]
and is the first to hold an office that requires Senate confirmation.
[5]
[6]
On October 19, 2021, Levine became the first openly transgender
four-star officer
in the nation's
eight uniformed services
.
[7]
Levine was named as one of
USA Today
'
s women of the year in 2022, which recognizes women who have made a significant impact on society.
[8]
Early life and education
Born on October 28, 1957, Levine is originally from
Wakefield, Massachusetts
.
[1]
[9]
Her parents, Melvin and Lillian Levine, were both lawyers.
[10]
Her sister, Bonnie Levine, is four years older.
[10]
Levine is Jewish and grew up attending
Hebrew school
.
[11]
Levine earned a high school diploma from
Belmont Hill School
in
Belmont, Massachusetts
.
[12]
Levine graduated from
Harvard College
and the
Tulane University School of Medicine
, completing a residency in pediatrics and a postdoctoral fellowship in adolescent medicine at the
Mount Sinai Medical Center
in
Manhattan
,
New York
.
[13]
Career
After completing her training in pediatrics and psychiatry at New York City's
Mount Sinai Hospital
, Levine moved from Manhattan to central Pennsylvania in 1993 where she joined the faculty of the
Penn State College of Medicine
and the staff at
Penn State Hershey Medical Center
.
[14]
During her tenure, she created Penn State Hershey Medical Center's Division of Adolescent Medicine and the Penn State Hershey Eating Disorders Program. She was in charge of the latter when she was nominated for the position of Pennsylvania physician general in 2015.
[14]
Pennsylvania Department of Health
In 2015, Levine was nominated by Pennsylvania Governor-elect
Tom Wolf
to serve as Pennsylvania's physician general. In one of her most lauded actions as physician general, Levine signed an order allowing law enforcement officers to carry
naloxone
.
[15]
In July 2017, Governor Wolf appointed Levine as Secretary of Health, and she was unanimously confirmed by the
Pennsylvania State Senate
.
COVID-19 response

COVID-19 measures
with Gov.
Tom Wolf
at the
Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center
in June 2020
During 2020 and until January 23, 2021, Levine led the public health response on
COVID-19 in Pennsylvania
as the state secretary of health. She worked closely on a daily basis with the
FEMA director
and led a daily press briefing. Along with Gov. Tom Wolf, Levine faced criticism from a few Republican leaders over her handling of the pandemic, particularly with regard to
nursing home
patients.
[16]
On March 18, 2020, Levine directed Pennsylvania nursing homes to admit new patients, including stable patients recovering from the COVID-19 virus who were released from the hospital.
[17]
Despite warnings from nursing home trade groups that such policies could unnecessarily cost more lives, there is no evidence that Levine placed COVID-positive patients in nursing home facilities or that her decision resulted in excess death among the elderly.
[16]
Levine was also criticized for mishandling COVID data reporting
[18]
and insufficiently addressing the long-standing oversight problems in Pennsylvania nursing homes that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
[19]
Levine faced further scrutiny in May 2020, when she moved her own mother out of a nursing home. In defending the move, Levine said, "My mother requested, and my sister and I, as her children, complied," describing her mother as "more than competent to make her own decisions."
[20]
These issues were momentarily highlighted by Republican lawmakers after President Biden nominated Levine for
Assistant Secretary for Health
. However, Levine's leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely praised as calm and steadfast by many Pennsylvanians and local media outlets.
[21]

On February 13, 2021, President
Joe Biden
formally
nominated
Levine to serve as
Assistant Secretary for Health
.
[22]
Her confirmation hearing with the
Senate HELP Committee
took place on February 25. On March 17, the committee voted 13-9 to advance her nomination for a full Senate vote.
[23]
On March 24, the Senate voted 52-48, with all Democrats and two Republicans —
Susan Collins
from
Maine
and
Lisa Murkowski
from
Alaska
— joining all members of the
Senate Democratic Caucus
to confirm her nomination.
[24]
Levine is the first openly transgender person to hold an office that requires Senate confirmation.
[25]
On October 19, 2021, Levine was
commissioned
as a four-star admiral in the
U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps
, becoming the first openly transgender four-star officer in any of the
United States uniformed services
as well as the first female four-star admiral in the Commissioned Corps.
[26]
LGBTQ health disparities
Shortly after her confirmation, Levine told
NBC News
that
LGBTQ youth
are topmost in her mind when it comes to addressing health disparities in the United States.
[27]
She cited bullying, suicide, discriminatory policies, and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic as pressing issues among LGBTQ youth. Levine has also expressed concerns about vaccine hesitancy among LGBTQ youth who are more likely to experience medical distrust and less likely to seek medical care.
[28]
During an April 2022 speech at
Texas Christian University
, Levine criticized "disturbing - and frankly discriminatory - laws and actions" that many states have implemented that affect the lives of LGBTQ youth.
[29]
In an interview with
NPR
, she cited a range of policies, including Florida's "
Don't Say Gay
" bill and Texas' push to investigate parents who provide
gender-affirming care
to their transgender children.
[30]
Arguing that such policies are based on politics rather than public health, Levine encouraged people to contact the
Office for Civil Rights
when they feel discriminated against and vowed to provide support to those who contact her office.

English embroiderer and textile artist
Christopher Shawe
or
Shaw
(died 1618) was an English embroiderer and textile artist who worked on
masque
costume for
Anne of Denmark
. He was a member of the
Worshipful Company of Broderers
.
Christopher Shawe realised the costume designs of
Inigo Jones
Career
[
edit
]
In September 1589, Shawe married Isobel Buttes, originally from
Streatham
, at
St Benet's, Paul's Wharf
, the church used by the
College of Arms
.
[1]
Shawe worked on masque costume in December 1603 for the female dancers in
The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses
, and presumably other masques of the season. Some of the costume was recycled from the wardrobe of
Elizabeth I
. He also worked on other "parcels" (orders) of embroidery for Anne of Denmark supplied to
Audrey Walsingham
.
[2]
"Master Shawe" was paid £106-7s for work on costumes for
The Masque of Beauty
in January 1608.
[3]
He worked on costumes for the masque
Tethys' Festival
in 1610 and his bill detailing his work survives.
[4]
He embroidered cobweb silver lawn with veins of silver and sea green silk, sewed motifs with silver and gold
oes
, and embroidered a pair of sea green satin dancing shoes.
[5]
At least one of the costumes he worked on features in an inventory of Anne of Denmark's wardrobe.
[6]
His bill of 5 June 1610 included:
Item, for inbrathring vij [7] yards of Copwede lane [cobweb lane] withe vaines of scilver and segrene and scilver oose and Carn[a]tion scilke, for working scilver and scilke vij. li [£7]
Item, for inbrawthering xxviij yards of
tiffenne
vere riche with oose goold, for working, scilke and goold oose xviij. li. [£18]
Item, for inbrawthering a peare of shues of segrene satten [sea green satin] vere riche, for workeng, goold and scilke iij. li. [£3]
[7]
The costume and shoes were for Anne of Denmark herself, who played the
Titan
sea goddess
Tethys
with her ladies as rivers personified.
[8]
A drawing by
Inigo Jones
of a costume for Tethys or a nymph with "shoes of satin, richly imbrodered" survives.
[9]
The seven yards of embroidered cobweb lawn were probably for the queen's veil. Cobweb lawn and net lawn were fine
linens
suitable for
veils
.
[10]
Male performers in
Jonson's
Masque of Hymen
wore crowns with veils of carnation and silver net lawn.
[11]
Anne of Denmark owned a number of
mantles
, made of the lightweight fabrics tiffany,
tinsel
, and cobweb lawn.
[12]
During the masque Tethys gave
Prince Henry
an embroidered scarf, figuratively or literally representing Britain, a "zone of love and amity". It is not clear if Shawe embroidered this prop, and some 19th-century writers including
Agnes Strickland
,
Charlotte Mary Yonge
, and Robert Folkestone Williams assumed that Anne of Denmark had made it herself.
[13]
Shawe was not paid in full and petitioned for payment for work on the masque and other embroidery for the queen.
[14]
Shawe died on 31 July 1618 and was buried at St Margaret's
Chipstead
, where an inscription records him as a Citizen of London and "Imbrodorer".
[15]
Charitable bequests
[
edit
]
By his will of 5 October 1617 he bequeathed an annuity of 20 shillings from his Chipstead property, Sturrock Crofts, and his tenement in London, the Barge in St Benets, administered by the London Embroiderer's Company, to be given in bread to the poor of the parish of Chipstead, and £3 to the schoolmaster at
Market Harborough
. He left 20 shillings yearly for the churchwardens of St Benets to give to the poor on 5 November in memory of the discovery of the
Gunpowder Plot
.
[16]
Family and Christopher Shawe junior
[
edit
]
He had two daughters and three sons, including Christopher Shawe, younger, who worked with him as an embroiderer for Anne of Denmark and had a house in St Benets at "Audlyn Hill", now Addle Hill.
[17]
The king's embroiderer William Brotherick lived next door, conveniently sited for the
royal Great Wardrobe
. The younger Shawe's widow and executrix, Margaret Shawe, petitioned
William Juxon
and other officials for payment of £439-12s after his death. She mentioned that she had three young children at the time of Christopher Shawe's death. The petitions refer to him as Christopher Shawe, younger, servant of Anne of Denmark.
[18]
While adjudicating a similar petition, Juxon consulted
Zachary Bethell
's account book of "Queen Anne's Robes".

[

Though recovering from injury,
Wayne Gardner
refuses to stay off the bike, and breaks his foot badly in practice. In qualifying,
Wayne Rainey
falls off and breaks a finger, but makes the start.
Through the first turn it’s
Kevin Schwantz
,
Mick Doohan
and
Pierfrancesco Chili
. Rainey is down at 6th.
After a few laps it’s Schwantz, Doohan and Chili, then a small gap to
Christian Sarron
,
Sito Pons
and Rainey. In a bizarre accident, Doohan and Chili, without touching, have simultaneous highsides. Doohan’s crash is messy, his bike riding
him
off the track.
Schwantz is safely away, and Rainey takes the lead in the new fight for second. Rainey leaves the group, and the fight for third is split three-ways between Mackenzie, Sarron and Pons.

History
[
edit
]
From 1997 to 2000, Shreveport, Louisiana was home to a professional hockey team in the
Western Professional Hockey League
(WPHL) named the
Shreveport Mudbugs
. In 2000, the Mudbugs relocated to nearby
Bossier City
to play out of
CenturyTel Center
and changed their name to the
Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs
. The Mudbugs then joined the
Central Hockey League
in 2001 when the WPHL merged with the CHL. The professional Mudbugs would eventually fold in 2011 citing low attendance and financial issues even though the team had just won the league championship.
[1]
[2]
In October 2015, it was announced that a new Mudbugs team would return for the 2016-17 season after signing a 12-year lease agreement with the Louisiana State Fairgrounds and returning to Hirsch Coliseum but as a member of the
Tier II junior
North American Hockey League
.
[3]
On April 8, 2016, the
Shreveport Mudbugs
were officially announced as an expansion team in the NAHL.
[4]
Former
Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs
player,
Karlis Zirnis
, was named the team's first head coach.
[5]
In their second season, the Mudbugs finished first in the South Division at the end of the regular season and played their way through the
Robertson Cup
playoffs to take the NAHL championship in 2018. Following the season, head coach Zirnis left the team to take an assistant coaching position with the
University of Alaska-Fairbanks hockey team
.

The school was founded at its current site in 1874, with the present building being built in 1918. In 1939, the Music and Industrial Arts wing was added, and the Fred J. Miller gymnasium was built in 1957. The "new wing" which includes a swimming pool and classrooms was built in 1962. In 1981 East High transformed from a three-year to a four year high school. In April 2002, a new administrative and counseling center and an addition that features a new cafeteria/commons, practice gymnasium, wrestling room and locker rooms were opened. The old cafeteria area on the 4th floor was converted into eight new classrooms. The newly renovated Elizabeth A.H. Green Auditorium reopened in October 2007. The Reggie Roby Fitness Center was opened in 2008. Additional renovations will take place in the years to come, funded by a local 1 cent local option sales tax.

Reggie Roby
, NFL wide receiver/returner

East High's men's basketball team is the marquee program at the school and has a long tradition of success, consistently reaching the state tournament and cracking national rankings at times. The Trojans have won state tournaments in 1974 (Class 2A), 1990 (3A) and 2003 (4A), and were runners-up in 1960 (A), 1991 (3A), 2002 (4A), and 2004 (4A).

textbook in 2004.
East High has the distinction, as of 2005, of holding both the record for longest football winning streak (55 wins from 1965 to 1971) and longest football losing streak in the state of Iowa (62 games from 1999 to 2006).

However, a youth program has generated a newfound interest in and focus on developing football talent in the area. Also, the NFL recently made Waterloo the only metro with a population under 300,000 to be named a site of one of their fully funded youth football camps.

]
The results of the emphasis on youth football in the area showed when the record losing streak was broken on October 13, 2006, and the 2010 football team made the playoffs for the first time since 1991. They continued to struggle, not winning a game from 2012 to 2016. This 37-game losing streak was broken with a win on August 25, 2017.
[8]
In the spring of 2021, East began exploring its athletic conference future after - especially in recent seasons - the Trojans consistently ranked near or at the bottom of the Mississippi Valley Conference all-sports rankings as the school's enrollment declined. Participation numbers in sports also have decreased, according to district officials. In June 2021, the district's school board approved East High's request to move to a new, as-of-yet-unnamed athletic conference, also including 10 current
Central Iowa Metro League
members, which earlier in 2021 broke off from that league's suburban schools for the same reasons. Despite the move, plans would be in place for East to continue its local rivalries with cross-town schools West and Columbus Catholic, and Cedar Falls.

The current
Constitution of Malta
(
Maltese
:
Konstituzzjoni ta' Malta
) was adopted as a legal order on 21 September 1964, and is the self-declared supreme law of the land. Therefore, any law or action in violation of the Constitution is null and void. Being a rigid constitution, it has a three-tier entrenchment basis in order for any amendments to take place.
Constitutional development since independence
[
edit
]
The Constitution has been amended twenty-four times, most recently in 2020 with the entrenchment that firstly, the chief justice from now on shall be appointed by a resolution of Parliament - the legislature is appointing the member of the Judiciary - the Chief Justice. This resolution has to be supported by the votes of at least two thirds of all those members who are eligible to vote. The constitution is typically called the
Constitution
of
Malta
and replaced the 1961 Constitution, dating from 24 October 1961.
George Borg Olivier
was its main instigator and negotiator.
George Borg Olivier
was the main instigator and negotiator of the Constitution
Under its 1964 constitution, Malta became a parliamentary democracy within the
Commonwealth
.
Queen Elizabeth II
was
sovereign
of Malta, and a
Governor-General
exercised executive authority on her behalf, while the actual direction and control of the
government
and the nation's affairs were in the hands of the
cabinet
under the leadership of a Maltese
Prime Minister
, the leader of the
party
that wins a majority of parliamentary seats in a
general election
for the
unicameral
House of Representatives
.
On 13 December 1974, under the Labour government Dom Mintoff, the constitution was revised, and Malta became a
republic
within the Commonwealth, with
executive authority
vested in a
Maltese President
, who is appointed by Parliament and who in turn, appoints as Prime Minister.
The President also nominally appoints, upon recommendation of the Prime Minister, the individual
ministers
to head each of the
government departments
. The cabinet is selected from among the members of the House of Representatives. The Constitution provides for general elections to be held at least every five years. Candidates are elected by the
Single Transferable Vote
system. The entire territory is divided into thirteen electoral districts each returning five MPs to a total of 65. Since 1987, in case a Party obtains an absolute majority of votes without achieving a Parliamentary majority a mechanism in the Constitution provides for additional seats to that Party to achieve a Parliamentary majority (Act IV of 1987). To date this mechanism, intended to counteract
gerrymandering
, came into effect twice: for the Sixth and the Eighth Parliaments. A similar mechanism was introduced in 1996 so that additional seats would be given to that Party obtaining a relative majority of votes but not a parliamentary majority with only two parties achieving Parliamentary representation. This mechanism was first applied in the
2008 general election
.
The nature of the constitution
[
edit
]
The
Independence Constitution
of Malta of 1964 established Malta as a
liberal
parliamentary democracy
.
[1]
It safeguarded the
fundamental
human rights
of
citizens
, and forced a separation between the
executive
,
judicial
and
legislative
powers, with regular elections based on
universal suffrage
. It defines
Roman Catholic church
as
state religion
[2]
and provision of
religious education
in
compulsory education
.
[3]
This constitution was developed through constitutional history and its evolution is partly modelled on the Italian Constitution. The constitutions of Malta fell under three main categories. These were:
Those over which the British possessed total power;
The intermediate genres of constitutions (1921-1947), where Malta had
self government
(the 1961 constitution was very similar to these constitutions);
the Independence Constitution of 1964.
On 27 July 1960, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies
declared to the
British House of Commons
the wish of
Her Majesty's Government
to reinstate
representative government
in Malta and declare that it was now time to work out a new constitution where elections could be held as soon as it was established. The Secretary,
Iain Macleod
, also notified the House of the appointment of a
Constitutional Commission
, under the chairmanship of
Sir Hilary Blood
, to devise thorough constitutional schemes after consultation with representatives of the
Maltese people
and local interests.
The Commissioners presented their report on 5 December 1960. The report was published on 8 March 1961. That same day, the Secretary of State declared to the House of Commons that Her Majesty's Government had taken a decision. The Commissioner's constitutional recommendations to be the basis for the subsequent Malta constitution were to be granted. The
1961 Constitution
was also known as the
Blood Constitution
. It was enclosed in the
Malta Constitution Order in Council 1961
and it was completed on 24 October of that same year.
[4]
The statement that the Order makes provision for a new constitution where Malta is given self-government is found on the final page of the Order in Council.
The
1961 Constitution
provided the backbone for the Independence Constitution. A date was provided to guarantee this legal continuity. An indispensable characteristic of this constitution is the substitution of the
diarchic
system, which was no longer practicable, by system of only one Government, the
Government of Malta
, with full legislative and executive powers. At that time Malta was still a
colony
and responsibility for defence and
external affairs
were referred to Her Majesty's Government. There was a clear indication that the road towards independence continued and now was at a highly developed stage. It is imperative to recognise that the 1961 Constitution established most of the features of the 1964 Constitution. The British recognised Malta as a State.
[5]
Another important characteristic of this constitution was an innovative introduction of a chapter covering the safeguarding of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual.
[6]
This is fairly significant because Fundamental Human Rights are a protection for the individual by the State. In the 1961 Constitution, Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms are found in Chapter IV. The protection of
freedom of movement
was introduced only in the 1964 Constitution.
The declaration of rights of the inhabitants of the islands of Malta and Gozo dated 15 June 1802, gives a collective declaration of rights. The 1961 Constitution gave birth to what was recognised as a Parliament in the 1964 Independence Constitution. The Cabinet had the general direction and management of the Government of Malta. It consisted of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister alone might summon it and it was this office which presided over it. Not more than seven other ministers were members of the Legislative Assembly, and they were collectively responsible to it. This was one of the first attempts to restate some of the more important British Constitutional Conventions in the constitution. In the exercise of his powers, the Governor was to act on the advice of the Cabinet, except where he was directed to act in his discretion or on the recommendation or advice of a person other than the Cabinet.
Three elections of the promulgation of the 1961 Constitution existed.
[7]
This constitution included the presence of a Cabinet for the first time in Malta. The legislature was
unicameral
. The Legislative Assembly's normal life span was of four years. It consisted of fifty
members
and they were elected by universal suffrage from ten electoral divisions on the system of
proportional representation
by the single transferable vote. The 1961 Constitution constructed a firm foundation for a future achievement of Independence. When in 1964 Malta did in fact become independent, because the Government chose to avoid breaking all ties with the
United Kingdom
, there was legal continuity of the legislation, as a result of which Parliament remained functional. To a certain extent the same situation existed as regards to the legislation by the British Parliament for Malta. The Malta Independence Order itself developed into the subject of an entrenchment, since here it is declared that this evolved into an extension to the 1961 Constitution even in the sense of an amendment.
[8]
Even though Malta acquired independence, there was an ongoing presence of continuity. One of them is the monarchy pre-1964 and prior 1964. The Malta Independence Order 1964 was subject to the Malta Independence Act of that same year and it is a document that holds the chief regulations that govern the constitution of a state. This document is supreme over each and every other document and all legislation is subject to it. Throughout Malta's constitutional history, the nation acquired its own constitution, and to a certain extent, the Independence Constitution is made up of certain principles that arose for the first time in previous constitutions. It can be said that the Independence Constitution has evolved from the constitution which preceded it. But one must not ignore the fact that changes have taken place in this process of evolution. The statement that the 1964 constitution is in fact a replica of the 1961 constitution with
sovereignty
added might be criticised by saying that some factors differ between the two constitutions. The 1964 constitution is not merely what can be defined as an improvement. It is more like another stepping-stone in constitutional history being the final step in a long series of constitutions. In fact, even though it may seem that some provisions were altered from the 1961 constitution to the 1964 constitution, some of those provisions remained unchanged until the
amendments
of the 1964 constitution were made.
[9]
On 14 April 2014, the anti-discrimination provision of constitution is amended to include
sexual orientation
and
gender identity
.
[10]
In 2020, following a review by the Council of Europe's
Venice Commission
, the constitution was amended to reduce the powers of the
Prime Minister
.

Montcalm
was a
F70 type
anti-submarine
frigate
of the French
Marine Nationale
. The French Navy does not use the term "
destroyer
" for any of its ships; hence some of the larger ships, referred to as "frigates", are registered as destroyers. She was the fourth French vessel named after the 18th century general
marquess
Louis de Montcalm de Saint Véran
.
Operational history
[
edit
]
Montcalm
was involved in operations off
Libya
during the
2011 Libyan Civil War
. The vessel was used to evacuate French and British citizens from the nation after fighting closed the airports.
[1]
From 13 to 26 October 2014, the frigate took part in the large international operational exercise Catamaran 2014 that practiced an amphibious assault.
[2]
Montcalm
was decommissioned on 3 July 2017.
[3]
The hull was then stripped and brought to
Brégaillon
to await final disposal.

Browning
is a former
town
in
Glacier County
,
Montana
, United States. It is the headquarters for the
Blackfeet Indian Reservation
and was the only incorporated town on the Reservation. The population was 1,018 at the
2020 census
.
[2]
The town was named in 1885 for
Commissioner of Indian Affairs
Daniel M. Browning.
[3]
[4]
The post office was established in 1895.
[5]
The town was disincorporated on September 26, 2018, after the town's government collapsed financially.

Climate
[
edit
]
Browning has a warm-summer
humid continental climate
(
Dfb
), bordering on a
subarctic climate
. From January 23 to January 24, 1916, the temperature fell 100 °F (56 °C), from 44 °F (7 °C) to −56 °F (−49 °C), the world record for greatest temperature drop in 24 hours.
[9]
Browning's climate is
semi-arid
and
continental
. Temperatures above 90 °F (32 °C) occur an average of twice annually, temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C) occur an average of 196 days annually, and those below 0 °F (−18 °C) occur an average of 32 days annually. There is a large degree of
diurnal temperature variation
that occurs in the summer, but not as much in the winter. Large temperature swings are possible, especially in fall, winter, and spring. Arctic-air intrusions from western Canada can bring sudden, severe temperature drops, while
chinook
events, with Pacific-originating warmer air descending from mountain ranges to the west, can result in dramatic temperature rises. Precipitation averages just over 14 inches per year, rendering the climate semi-arid. From November to March or April, the precipitation is primarily snow. Average monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and highest in the warm season. On average, June is the wettest month, with showers and thunderstorms most likely among all months.
