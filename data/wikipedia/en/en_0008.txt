The history of what is now
Wales
(
Welsh
:
Cymru
) begins with evidence of a
Neanderthal
presence from at least 230,000 years ago, while
Homo sapiens
arrived by about 31,000 BC. However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the
last ice age
around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the
Mesolithic
,
Neolithic
, and
Bronze Age
. During the
Iron Age
the region, like all of Britain south of the
Firth of Forth
, the culture had become Celtic, with a common
Brittonic language
. The
Romans
, who began their
conquest of Britain
in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the
Deceangli
, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the
Ordovices
in 79. The Romans
departed from Britain
in the 5th century, opening the door for the
Anglo-Saxon settlement
. Thereafter, the culture began to splinter into a number of kingdoms. The
Welsh people
formed with English encroachment that effectively separated them from the other surviving
Brittonic
-speaking peoples in the early middle ages.
In the
post-Roman
period, a number of Welsh kingdoms formed in present-day Wales, including
Gwynedd
,
Powys
,
Deheubarth
,
Brycheiniog
,
Ergyng
and
Gwent
. While some rulers extended their control over other Welsh territories and into western England, none were able to unite Wales for long.  Internecine struggles and external pressure from the English and later, the
Norman
conquerors of England, led to the Welsh kingdoms coming gradually under the sway of the English crown. In 1282, the death of
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
led to the
conquest
of the
Principality of Wales
by King
Edward I of England
; since then, the
heir apparent
to the English monarch has borne the title "
Prince of Wales
". The Welsh launched several revolts against English rule, the last significant one being that led by
Owain Glyndŵr
in the early 15th century. In the 16th century
Henry VIII
, himself of Welsh extraction as a great-grandson of
Owen Tudor
, passed the
Laws in Wales Acts
aiming to fully incorporate Wales into the
Kingdom of England
.
Wales became part of the
Kingdom of Great Britain
in 1707 and then the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
in 1801. Yet, the Welsh retained their language and culture despite heavy English dominance. The publication of the extremely significant first complete
Welsh translation of the Bible
by
William Morgan
in 1588 greatly advanced the position of Welsh as a
literary language
. The 18th century saw the beginnings of two changes that would greatly affect Wales, the
Welsh Methodist revival
, which led the country to turn increasingly
nonconformist
in religion, and the
Industrial Revolution
. During the rise of the
British Empire
, 19th century Southeast Wales in particular experienced rapid industrialisation and a dramatic rise in population as a result of the explosion of the
coal
and
iron industries
. Wales played a full and willing role in World War One. The industries of the Empire in Wales declined in the 20th century with the end of the British Empire following the Second World War, while
nationalist
sentiment and interest in self-determination rose. The
Labour Party
replaced the
Liberal Party
as the dominant political force in the 1920s. Wales played a considerable role during World War Two along with the rest of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Allies, and its cities were bombed extensively during
the Blitz
. The nationalist party
Plaid Cymru
gained momentum from the 1960s. In a 1997
referendum
, Welsh voters approved the
devolution
of governmental responsibility to a
National Assembly for Wales
which first met in 1999, renamed
Senedd Cymru
or the Welsh Parliament in May 2020.
Prehistoric era

Prehistoric Wales
Bryn Celli Ddu, a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey
The earliest known human remains discovered in modern-day Wales is a
Neanderthal
jawbone, found at the
Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site
in the valley of the
River Elwy
in
North Wales
, whose owner lived about 230,000 years ago in the
Lower Palaeolithic
period.
[1]
The
Red Lady of Paviland
, a human skeleton dyed in
red ochre
, was discovered in 1823 in one of the Paviland
limestone
caves of the
Gower Peninsula
in
Swansea
, South Wales. Despite the name, the skeleton is that of a young man who lived about 33,000 years ago at the end of the Upper
Paleolithic
Period (old
Stone Age
).
[2]
It is considered to be the oldest known ceremonial burial in Western Europe. The skeleton was found along with jewellery made from
ivory
and
seashells
and a
mammoth
's skull.
Following the last ice age, Wales became roughly the shape it is today by about 8000 BC and was inhabited by
Mesolithic
hunter-gatherers
. The earliest farming communities are now believed to date from about 4000 BC, marking the beginning of the
Neolithic
period. This period saw the construction of many
chambered tombs
, particularly
dolmens
or
cromlechs
. The most notable examples of megalithic tombs include
Bryn Celli Ddu
and
Barclodiad y Gawres
on Anglesey,
[3]
Pentre Ifan
in Pembrokeshire, and
Tinkinswood Burial Chamber
in the
Vale of Glamorgan
.
[4]
Metal tools first appeared in Wales about 2500 BC, initially copper followed by
bronze
. The climate during the
Early Bronze Age
(c. 5000-1400 BC) is thought to have been warmer than at present, as there are many remains from this period in what are now bleak uplands. The Late Bronze Age (c. 1400-750 BC) saw the development of more advanced bronze implements. Much of the copper for the production of bronze probably came from the copper mine on the
Great Orme
, where prehistoric mining on a very large scale dates largely from the middle Bronze Age.
[5]
Radiocarbon dating
has shown the earliest hillforts in what would become Wales, to have been constructed during this period. Historian
John Davies
, theorises that a worsening climate after around 1250 BC (lower temperatures and heavier rainfall) required more productive land to be defended.
[6]
The earliest iron implement found in Wales is a sword from
Llyn Fawr
which overlooks the head of the
Vale of Neath
, which is thought to date to about 600 BC.
[7]
Hillforts continued to be built during the
British Iron Age
. Nearly 600 hillforts are in Wales, over 20% of those found in Britain, examples being
Pen Dinas
near
Aberystwyth
and
Tre'r Ceiri
on the
Llŷn peninsula
.
[6]
A particularly significant find from this period was made in 1943 at
Llyn Cerrig Bach
on Anglesey when the ground was being prepared for the construction of a
Royal Air Force
base. The cache included weapons, shields,
chariots
along with their fittings and harnesses, and slave chains and tools. Many had been deliberately broken and seem to have been
votive offerings
.
[8]
A tendency to see the creation of hillforts as evidence of a Celtic invasion that also brought a Celtic language to the Britain has been dealt a blow by recognition that the earliest forts predate the arrival of Iron Age Celtic culture by hundreds of years. The present tendency is to reject the hypothesis of mass invasion in favour of more sporadic migration and a cultural spread of language and ideas, a "culminative Celticity".

Roman era

King of the Britons
Caradog by Thomas Prydderch. Caradog led multiple celtic tribes against the Romans.
The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years.
[9]
The most famous of resistance was led by
Caradog
of the Celtic Catuvellauni tribe (modern day Essex), which were defeated by the Romans. Now leading the Celtic tribes of the
Ordovices
and
Silures
(of present day Monmouthshire), Caradog led a successful guerilla war against the Romans. His armies were eventually defeated at the Battle of
Caer Caradog
on the Anglo-Welsh border in AD 50. Caradog was later taken to Rome and gave a speech, impressing the Roman emperor to the extent that he was pardoned and allowed to live peacefully in Rome.
[10]
The Roman conquest was completed in 78, with Roman rule lasting until 383. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of
South Wales
east of the
Gower Peninsula
, where there is a legacy of Romanisation.
[9]
The only town in Wales founded by the Romans,
Caerwent
, is located in South Wales. Both Caerwent and
Carmarthen
, also in southern Wales, would become Roman
civitates
.
[11]
Roman invasion of Wales.
By AD 47, Rome had invaded and conquered all of southernmost and southeastern Britain under the first
Roman governor
of Britain. As part of the
Roman conquest of Britain
, a series of campaigns to conquer Wales was launched by his successor in 48 and would continue intermittently under successive
governors
until the conquest was completed in 78. It is these campaigns of conquest that are the most widely known feature of Wales during the
Roman era
due to the spirited but unsuccessful defence of their homelands by two native tribes, the
Silures
and the
Ordovices
.
The
Demetae
of southwestern Wales seem to have quickly made their peace with the Romans, as there is no indication of war with Rome, and their homeland was not heavily planted with forts nor overlaid with roads. The Demetae would be the only Welsh tribe to emerge from Roman rule with their homeland and tribal name intact.
[a]
Wales was a rich source of mineral wealth and the Romans used their
engineering
technology
to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as
zinc
and silver.
[13]
When the mines were no longer practical or profitable, they were abandoned. Roman economic development was concentrated in southeastern Britain, with no significant industries located in Wales.
[13]
This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the needed materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to development.
Subsequent medieval Welsh lore developed a series of legends around Macsen Wledig, a literary and mythical figure derived from
Magnus Maximus
, a historical Roman general who revolted and became Emperor in the west from 383 to 388. Magnus Maximus was based in Britain in the early 380s, immediately prior to his usurpation of the throne. Several medieval Welsh dynasties claimed that they were descended from Macsen, thereby linking their origins to the legitimacy and prestige of a Roman past.
[14]
[15]
Later Welsh genealogies, medieval poetry, for example the
Mabinogion
, and chronicles such as the
Historia Brittonum
and
Annales Cambriae
, used myths and legends to give roles in Welsh history to historical and quasi-historical figures from the Roman and
Sub-Roman
periods. Aside from Macsen Wledig, other examples include
St Helena
, the Emperor
Constantine
and
Coel Hen
.

When the Roman garrison of Britain was withdrawn in 410, the various British states were left self-governing. Evidence for a continuing Roman influence after the departure of the
Roman legions
is provided by an inscribed stone from
Gwynedd
dated between the late 5th and mid-6th centuries commemorating a certain
Cantiorix
who was described as a citizen (
cives
) of Gwynedd and a cousin of Maglos the
magistrate
(
magistratus
).
[17]
There was considerable Irish colonisation in
Dyfed
, where there are many stones with
ogham
inscriptions.
[18]
Wales had become Christian under the Romans, and the 'age of the saints' (approximately 500-700) was marked by the establishment of monastic settlements throughout the country, by religious leaders such as
Saint David
,
Illtud
and
Saint Teilo
.
[19]

Island of Britain in AD 500.
One of the reasons for the Roman withdrawal was the pressure put upon the empire's military resources by the incursion of barbarian tribes from the east. These tribes, including the
Angles
and
Saxons
, gradually took control of eastern and southern Britain. At the
Battle of Chester
in 616, the forces of
Powys
and other British kingdoms were defeated by the
Northumbrians
under
Æthelfrith
, with king
Selyf ap Cynan
among the dead.
[20]
It has been suggested that this battle finally severed the land connection between Wales and the kingdoms of the
Hen Ogledd
("Old North"), the
Brittonic-speaking
regions of what is now southern
Scotland
and
northern England
, including
Rheged
,
Strathclyde
,
Elmet
and
Gododdin
, where
Old Welsh
was also spoken.

From the 8th century on, Wales was by far the largest of the three remnant
Brittonic
areas in Britain, the other two being the Hen Ogledd and
Cornwall
.
Wales was divided into a number of separate kingdoms, the largest of these being
Gwynedd
in northwest Wales and
Powys
in the east. Gwynedd was the most powerful of these kingdoms in the 6th and 7th centuries, under rulers such as
Maelgwn Gwynedd
(died 547)
[21]
and
Cadwallon ap Cadfan
(died 634/5)
[22]
who in alliance with
Penda of Mercia
was able to lead his armies as far as the
Kingdom of Northumbria
and control it for a period. Following Cadwallon's death in battle the following year, his successor
Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw
also allied himself with Penda against Northumbria but thereafter Gwynedd, like the other Welsh kingdoms, was mainly engaged in defensive warfare against the growing power of
Mercia
.

as the easternmost of the major kingdoms of Wales came under the most pressure from the English in
Cheshire
, Shropshire and
Herefordshire
. This kingdom originally extended east into areas now in England, and its ancient capital,
Pengwern
, has been variously identified as modern
Shrewsbury
or a site north of
Baschurch
.
[23]
These areas were lost to the kingdom of
Mercia
. The construction of the earthwork known as
Offa's Dyke
(usually attributed to
Offa of Mercia
in the
8th century
) may have marked an agreed border.
[24]
For a single man to rule the whole country during this period was rare. This is often ascribed to the inheritance system practised in Wales. All sons received an equal share of their father's property (including illegitimate sons), resulting in the division of territories. However, the
Welsh laws
prescribe this system of division for land in general, not for kingdoms, where there is provision for an
edling
(or heir) to the kingdom to be chosen, usually by the king. Any son, legitimate or illegitimate, could be chosen as edling and there were frequently disappointed candidates prepared to challenge the chosen heir.
[b]
.
The first to rule a considerable part of Wales was
Rhodri the Great
, originally king of
Gwynedd
during the
9th century
, who was able to extend his rule to
Powys
and
Ceredigion
.
[26]
On his death his realms were divided between his sons. Rhodri's grandson,
Hywel Dda
(Hywel the Good), formed the kingdom of
Deheubarth
by joining smaller kingdoms in the southwest and had extended his rule to most of Wales by 942.
[27]
He is traditionally associated with the codification of
Welsh law
at a council which he called at
Whitland
, the laws from then on usually being called the "Laws of Hywel". Hywel followed a policy of peace with the English. On his death in 949 his sons were able to keep control of
Deheubarth
but lost
Gwynedd
to the traditional dynasty of this kingdom.
[28]
Wales was now coming under increasing attack by
Vikings
, particularly Danish raids in the period between 950 and 1000. According to the chronicle
Brut y Tywysogion
,
Godfrey Haroldson
carried off two thousand captives from
Anglesey
in 987, and the king of Gwynedd,
Maredudd ab Owain
is reported to have redeemed many of his subjects from slavery by paying the Danes a large ransom.
[29]
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
was the only ruler to be able to unite the Welsh kingdoms under his rule. Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1055 he was ruler of almost all of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. However, he was defeated by
Harold Godwinson
in 1063 and killed by his own men. His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms.

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
was the only ruler to be able to unite Wales under his rule. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth.
[32]
Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was the ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms.
[30]
Historian
John Davies
stated that Gruffydd was, "the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor."
[33]
During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace.
[34]
Norman invasion
[

See also:
Norman invasion of Wales
Standard of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, King of Powys 1063-1075.
At the time of the
Norman conquest of England
in 1066, the dominant ruler in Wales was
Bleddyn ap Cynfyn
, who was king of
Gwynedd
and
Powys
. The initial Norman successes were in the south, where
William Fitz Osbern
overran
Gwent
before 1070. By 1074, the forces of the
Earl of Shrewsbury
were ravaging
Deheubarth
.
[35]
The killing of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn in 1075 led to civil war and gave the
Normans
an opportunity to seize lands in
North Wales
. In 1081
Gruffudd ap Cynan
, who had just won the throne of Gwynedd from
Trahaearn ap Caradog
at the
Battle of Mynydd Carn
was enticed to a meeting with the
Earl of Chester
and
Earl of Shrewsbury
and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans.
[36]
In the south
William the Conqueror
advanced into
Dyfed
founding castles and mints at
St David's
and
Cardiff
.
[37]
Rhys ap Tewdwr
of Deheubarth was killed in 1093 in
Brycheiniog
, and his kingdom was seized and divided between various Norman lordships.
[38]
The Norman conquest of Wales appeared virtually complete.
Caerphilly Castle
. The construction of this castle between 1268 and 1271 by
Gilbert de Clare
led to a dispute between
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
and the English crown, one of the issues which led to the wars of 1277 and 1282 and the end of Welsh independence
In 1094, however, there was a general Welsh revolt against Norman rule, and gradually territories were won back.
Gruffudd ap Cynan
was eventually able to build a strong kingdom in
Gwynedd
. His son,
Owain Gwynedd
, allied with
Gruffydd ap Rhys
of Deheubarth won a crushing victory over the Normans at the
Battle of Crug Mawr
in 1136 and annexed
Ceredigion
. Owain followed his father on the throne of Gwynedd the following year and ruled until his death in 1170.
[39]
He was able to profit from disunity in England, where King
Stephen
and
Empress Matilda
were engaged in a struggle for the throne, to extend the borders of Gwynedd further east than ever before.
Powys
also had a strong ruler at this time in
Madog ap Maredudd
, but when his death in 1160 was quickly followed by the death of his heir,
Llywelyn ap Madog
, Powys was split into two parts and never subsequently reunited.
[40]
In the south,
Gruffydd ap Rhys
was killed in 1137, but his four sons, who all ruled Deheubarth in turn, were eventually able to win back most of their grandfather's kingdom from the Normans. The youngest of the four,
Rhys ap Gruffydd
(Lord Rhys) ruled from 1155 to 1197. In 1171 Rhys met
King Henry II
and came to an agreement with him whereby Rhys had to pay a tribute but was confirmed in all his conquests and was later named
Justiciar of South Wales
. Rhys held a
festival of poetry and song at his court
at
Cardigan
over Christmas 1176 which is generally regarded as the first recorded
Eisteddfod
. Owain Gwynedd's death led to the splitting of Gwynedd between his sons, while Rhys made Deheubarth dominant in Wales for a time.

Conquest of Wales by Edward I
The Llywelyn Monument at Cilmeri
Out of the power struggle in Gwynedd eventually arose one of the greatest of Welsh leaders,
Llywelyn ab Iorwerth
, also known as Llywelyn Fawr (the Great), who was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200
[42]
and by his death in 1240 was effectively ruler of much of Wales.
[43]
Llywelyn made his 'capital' and headquarters at
Abergwyngregyn
on the north coast, overlooking the
Menai Strait
. In 1200 he became King of Gwynedd and agreed to a treaty of peace with King John of England, marrying his illegitimate daughter Joan. In 1208, Llywelyn claimed the Kingdom of Powys after the arrest of Gwenwynwyn ap Owain by King John, who disapproved of his attacks on Marcher Lords of the South. Friendship broke down and John invaded parts of Gwynedd in 1211, taking Llywelyn's eldest son as hostage, and also forcing the surrender of territory in north-east Wales. Llywelyn's son,
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn
, and other hostages were used as security by the king. However the Welsh and Scots joined English rebel Barons in forcing John to sign the Magna Carta of 1215. The document therefore holds specific Welsh provisions. These included the return of lands and liberties to Welshmen if those lands and liberties had been taken by English (and vice versa) without a law abiding judgement of their peers. Also the immediate return of Gruffydd and the other Welsh hostages.
[44]
Llywelyn went on to gain dominance over all Wales the following year.
[45]
After the death of John in 1216, Llywelyn and the new King Henry III agreed to the
treaty of Worcester
in 1218, which confirmed Llywelyn's right to Wales until his death, recognising him as Prince of Wales.
[45]
His son
Dafydd ap Llywelyn
followed him as ruler of Gwynedd, but King
Henry III of England
would not allow him to inherit his father's position elsewhere in Wales.
[46]
War broke out in 1241 and then again in 1245, and the issue was still in the balance when Dafydd died suddenly at Abergwyngregyn, without leaving an heir in early 1246. Llywelyn the Great's other son,
Gruffudd
had been killed trying to escape from the
Tower of London
in 1244. Gruffudd had left four sons, and a period of internal conflict between three of these ended in the rise to power of
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd
(also known as
Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf
;
Llywelyn, Our Last Leader
).
[

The
Treaty of Montgomery
in 1267, signed with King Henry III of England, confirmed Llywelyn in control, directly or indirectly, over a large part of Wales. In November 1276,
Edward I King of England
declared war on Llywelyn II over a series of disputes.
[47]
Realising his position was hopeless, Llywelyn II surrendered without battle. Edward negotiated a settlement, the
Treaty of Aberconwy
, which greatly restricted Llywelyn's authority.
[48]
War broke out again when Llywelyn's brother
Dafydd ap Gruffudd
attacked
Hawarden Castle
on
Palm Sunday
1282. On 11 December 1282, Llywelyn was lured into a meeting in Cilmeri in
Builth Wells
castle
with unknown Marchers, where he was killed and his army subsequently destroyed.
[49]
His brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd continued an increasingly forlorn resistance. He was captured in June 1283 and was
hanged, drawn and quartered
at
Shrewsbury
.

Following the deaths of Llywelyn and Dafydd, Edward ended
Welsh independence
, introducing the royal ordinance of the
Statute of Rhuddlan
in 1284. The statute was a constitutional change annexing the
Principality of Wales
to the Realm of England.

Wales in the Late Middle Ages
Harlech Castle
was one of a series built by
Edward I
to consolidate his conquest.
After passing the
Statute of Rhuddlan
, which restricted
Welsh law
, King Edward's ring of impressive stone
castles
assisted the domination of Wales, and he crowned his conquest by giving the title
Prince of Wales
to his son and heir in 1301.
[52]
Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had a different culture. English kings appointed a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by the heir to the throne. This Council normally sat in
Ludlow
, now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area in the
Welsh Marches
. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets.
Dafydd ap Gwilym
, who flourished in the middle of the
14th century
, is considered by many to be the greatest of the Welsh poets.
There were a number of rebellions including ones led by
Madog ap Llywelyn
in 1294-1295
[53]
and by
Llywelyn Bren
, Lord of Senghenydd, in 1316-1318. In the 1370s the last representative in the male line of the ruling house of
Gwynedd
,
Owain Lawgoch
, twice planned an invasion of Wales with French support. The English government responded to the threat by sending an agent to assassinate Owain in
Poitou
in 1378.
[54]
Owain Glyndŵr
In 1400, a Welsh nobleman,
Owain Glyndŵr
, revolted against
Henry IV of England
. Owain inflicted a number of defeats on the English forces and for a few years controlled most of Wales. Some of his achievements included holding the first Welsh Parliament at
Machynlleth
and plans for two universities. Eventually the king's forces were able to regain control of Wales and the rebellion died out, but Owain himself was never captured. His rebellion caused a great upsurge in Welsh identity and he was widely supported by Welsh people throughout the country.
[55]
As a response to Glyndŵr's rebellion, the English parliament passed the
Penal Laws against the Welsh people
in 1402. These prohibited the Welsh from carrying arms, from holding office and from dwelling in fortified towns. These prohibitions also applied to Englishmen who married Welsh women. These laws remained in force after the rebellion, although in practice they were gradually relaxed.
[56]
In the
Wars of the Roses
, which began in 1455, both sides made considerable use of Welsh troops. The main figures in Wales were the two
Earls of Pembroke
, the Yorkist
William Herbert
and the Lancastrian
Jasper Tudor
. A
Council of Wales and the Marches
was created to rule Wales, by the Lancastrian
Henry VI
for his son
Edward of Westminster
in 1457. The
Council
was created again in 1471 by
Edward IV
for his son
Edward V
.

Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII
In 1485 Jasper's nephew,
Henry Tudor
, landed in Wales with a small force to launch his bid for the throne of England. Henry was of Welsh descent, counting princes such as
Rhys ap Gruffydd
among his ancestors, and his cause gained much support in Wales. Henry defeated King
Richard III of England
at the
Battle of Bosworth Field
with an army containing many Welsh soldiers and gained the throne as
Henry VII of England
. Henry VII again created a
Council of Wales and the Marches
for his son
Prince Arthur
.
[57]
Under his son,
Henry VIII of England
, the
Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542
were passed, integrating Wales with England in legal terms, abolishing the Welsh legal system, and banning the
Welsh language
from any official role or status, but it did for the first time define the Wales-England border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament.
[58]
They also abolished any legal distinction between the Welsh and the English, thereby effectively ending the Penal Code although this was not formally repealed.

Early modern period in Wales
Portrait of William Morgan.
Following
Henry VIII
's break with Rome and the Pope, Wales for the most part followed England in accepting
Anglicanism
, although a number of
Catholics
were active in attempting to counteract this and produced some of the earliest books printed in Welsh. In 1588,
William Morgan
produced the first complete translation of the
Welsh Bible
.
[60]
[c]
Morgan's Bible is one of the most significant books in the Welsh language, and its publication greatly increased the stature and scope of the Welsh language and
literature
.
[60]
Bishop
Richard Davies
and dissident Protestant cleric
John Penry
introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales' Methodist movement. However, few copies of Calvin's works were available before the mid-19th century.
[62]
In 1567, Davies,
William Salesbury
, and
Thomas Huet
completed the first modern translation of the New Testament and the first translation of the
Book of Common Prayer
(
Welsh
:
Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin
). In 1588,
William Morgan
completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were as important to the survival of the Welsh language and had the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a
liturgical language
and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English.
Wales was overwhelmingly
Royalist
in the
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
in the early 17th century, though there were some notable exceptions such as
John Jones Maesygarnedd
and the
Puritan
writer
Morgan Llwyd
.
[63]
Wales was an important source of men for the armies of King
Charles I of England
,
[64]
though no major battles took place in Wales. The
Second English Civil War
began when unpaid Parliamentarian troops in
Pembrokeshire
changed sides in early 1648.
[65]
Colonel
Thomas Horton
defeated the Royalist rebels at the
battle of St. Fagans
in May and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after the protracted two-month
siege of Pembroke
.
Education in Wales was at a very low ebb in this period, with the only education available being in English while the majority of the population spoke only Welsh. In 1731,
Griffith Jones
started circulating schools in
Carmarthenshire
, held in one location for about three months before moving (or "circulating") to another location. The language of instruction in these schools was Welsh. By Griffith Jones' death, in 1761, it is estimated that up to 250,000 people had learnt to read in schools throughout Wales.
[66]
Two of the furnaces of the
Blaenavon Ironworks
The 18th century also saw the
Welsh Methodist revival
, led by
Daniel Rowland
,
Howell Harris
and
William Williams Pantycelyn
.
[67]
Nonconformity was a significant influence in Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The
Welsh Methodist revival
of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the
Church of England
in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was
Calvinist
rather than
Arminian
. In the early 19th century the Welsh
Methodists
broke away from the
Anglican
church and established their own denomination, now the
Presbyterian Church of Wales
. This also led to the strengthening of other nonconformist denominations, and by the middle of the 19th century, Wales was largely
Nonconformist
in religion. This had considerable implications for the Welsh language as it was the main language of the nonconformist churches in Wales. The
Sunday schools
which became an important feature of Welsh life made a large part of the population literate in Welsh, which was important for the survival of the language as it was not taught in the schools. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist
Presbyterian Church of Wales
in 1823.
[68]
The Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older
nonconformist
churches, or
dissenters
the
Baptists
and the
Congregationalists
who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a
nonconformist
country.
The end of the 18th century saw the beginnings of the
Industrial Revolution
, and the presence of iron ore,
limestone
and large coal deposits in south-east Wales meant that this area soon saw the establishment of
ironworks
and coal mines, notably the
Cyfarthfa Ironworks
and the
Dowlais Ironworks
at
Merthyr Tydfil
.
Modern history

Main article:
Modern history of Wales
1800-1914
[

Further information:
Industrial revolution in Wales
The modern history of Wales starts in the 19th century when South Wales became heavily industrialised with ironworks; this, along with the spread of coal mining to the
Cynon
and
Rhondda
valleys from the 1840s, led to an increase in population.
[69]
The social effects of industrialisation resulted in armed uprisings against the mainly English owners.
[70]
Socialism developed in South Wales in the latter part of the century, accompanied by the increasing politicisation of religious
Nonconformism
. The first
Labour
MP,
Keir Hardie
, was elected as a junior member for the Welsh constituency of
Merthyr Tydfil
and
Aberdare
in 1900.
[71]
Big Pit, National Coal Museum.
The population of Wales doubled to over one million between 1801 and 1851 and doubled again, reaching 2,421,000 by 1911.  Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts especially
Glamorganshire
.
[72]
Part of this increase can be attributed to the
demographic transition
seen in most industrialising countries during the
Industrial Revolution
, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also a large-scale migration of people into Wales during the industrial revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of
Italians
, migrating to South Wales, as well as Russian and Polish Jews.
[73]
The first decade of the 20th century was the period of the coal boom in South Wales when population growth exceeded 20 per cent.
[74]
[
]
Demographic changes affected the language frontier; the proportion of Welsh speakers in the Rhondda valley fell from 64 per cent in 1901 to 55 per cent ten years later, and similar trends were evident elsewhere in South Wales.
[75]
[
]
The
1904-1905 Welsh Revival
was the largest full-scale
Christian revival
of Wales of the 20th century. It is believed that at least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904-1905 revival, but despite this it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly.
[76]
Kenneth O. Morgan
argues that the 1850-1914 era:
was a story of growing political democracy with the hegemony of the Liberals in national and local government, of an increasingly thriving economy in the valleys of South Wales, the world's dominant coal-exporting area with massive ports at Cardiff and Barry, increasingly buoyant literature and a revival in the eisteddfod, and of much vitality in the nonconformist chapels especially after the short-lived impetus from the ‘great revival’, Y Diwygiad Mawr, of 1904-5. Overall, there was a pervasive sense of strong national identity, with a national museum, a national library and a national university as its vanguard.
[77]
'The Welsh at Mametz Wood' painted by Christopher Williams, commissioned by Secretary of State for War at the time, David Lloyd George.
1914-1945
[
edit
]
The world wars and interwar period were hard times for Wales, in terms of the faltering economy of antiwar losses. Men eagerly volunteered for war service.
[78]
The
First World War
and its aftermath had severe impact on Wales in terms of economic impact as well as war-time casualties. The result was significant social deprivation.
[77]
The
Labour Party
replaced the Liberals as the dominant party in Wales, particularly in the industrial valleys of
South Wales
.  Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, but initially, its growth was slow and it gained few votes at parliamentary elections.
[79]
Post war to present
[
edit
]
In the immediate period after the
Second World War
there was a strong revival in economic growth, accompanied by greater personal material well-being for the poorer elements of society as a result of the new systems of social welfare. Support for political nationalism strengthened with some success for Plaid Cymru and increasing pressure for Welsh devolution.
[77]
Nevertheless, the coal industry steadily declined after 1945.
[80]
By the early 1990s, there was only one deep pit still working in Wales. There was a similar catastrophic decline in the steel industry (the
steel crisis
), and the Welsh economy, like that of other developed societies, tilted increasingly towards the expanding service sector.
Senedd-Welsh Parliament, Cardiff Bay.
Meanwhile growing calls to recognise the Welsh language at an institutional level led to the passing of the
Welsh Language Act 1967
. The Welsh language was thus formally recognised as a legitimate language in legal and administrative contexts for the first time in English law.
[81]
The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the
Welsh language
was declining, falling from just under 50% in 1901 to 43.5% in 1911 and reaching a low of 18.9% in 1981. It has risen slightly since.
[82]
In a
referendum
in 1979, Wales voted against
devolution for Wales
by an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a
second referendum
on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent).
[83]
The
National Assembly for Wales
(
Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru
) was set up in 1999 (under the
Government of Wales Act 1998
) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers.
[84]
The Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) of the UK Parliament reformed the
National Assembly for Wales
and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act created a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature.
[85]
Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law-making powers of the National Assembly, it was then able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement
[86]
and in May 2020, it was renamed "Senedd Cymru" or "the Welsh Parliament", commonly known as the "
Senedd
" in both English and Welsh.
[87]
Historiography
[
edit
]
Until recently, says Martin Johnes:
the historiography of modern Wales was rather narrow. Its domain was the fortunes of the Liberals and Labour, the impact of trade unions and protest, and the cultural realms of nonconformity and the Welsh language. This was not surprising—all emergent fields start with the big topics and the big questions—but it did give much of Welsh academic history a rather particular flavour. It was institutional and male, and yet still concerned with fields of enquiry that lay outside the confines of the British establishment.

Pete Pistone
is an American motorsports journalist and commentator who works for the
Motor Racing Network
. He is the lead writer for MRN.com and has worked for the radio network since 2009 after they purchased RacingOne.com. Since 2009, Pistone has been a co-host of the nationally syndicated
Sirius XM
show
The Morning Drive
on
Sirius XM NASCAR Radio
.
Early years
[
edit
]
Born in
Chicago
, Pistone became "exposed to racing from day one because my family was in the sport (being his uncle
Tom Pistone
was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver and winner in the 1950s). I spent one summer with Tiger when he was running the old late model sportsman division and I remember riding in the race car with my cousins on a hauler going to track after track after track on a nightly basis. When I got old enough to get my license the Chicago and Midwest short track world was my oyster and places like Grundy County Speedway, Illiana Speedway, Slinger Speedway were regular trips as well as following the old ARTGO Series and ASA. I landed the track announcer job at Rockford Speedway thanks to the Deery family and would drive there twice a week from our northwest suburban Chicago home to announce as well as at special races."
[1]
Journalistic career
[
edit
]
After graduating from
Northern Illinois University
, Pistone spent 10 years hosting a weekly motorsports show called "Victory Lane" on
Chicagoland Television
.
[1]
In 1997, he was hired by the
Chicago Sun-Times
and spent six years as the motorsports reporter/columnist for the paper where he covered
NASCAR
and other forms of racing.
[1]
In 2003, he was hired at the same position by
CBSSports.com
where he spent the next six years.
[1]
In 2001, he along with fellow Chicago native Jeff Wackerlin worked at RacingOne.com which he described as "one of the first of its kind during the blossoming era of the Internet. It was a new experience writing and reporting in the online world and not in the more traditional manner of print or broadcast and to say there were some growing pains is an understatement. We had to prove to sanctioning bodies like NASCAR and
IndyCar
that we were legitimate media in order receive access and there were a number of tracks that wouldn't grant us credentials because they didn't recognize the scope or depth of digital reporting back then. In fact (David) Poole was a help in getting some tracks to allow us access. Long story short the original group sold the company, which wasn't unique in the relatively early Internet days, and we went through a number of different ownership groups to keep going. Finally
International Speedway Corporation
(ISC) bought us and in time the site changed over to be aligned with MRN and amplify the radio network as a digital property. Since I had broadcasting experience as well as my writing and reporting background, our network president David Hyatt gave me a shot at working on air as a pit reporter in addition to creating content for the site. So over my years I've become a hybrid reporter for the network and company and get to work in the best of both worlds for me in both on-air and digital roles."
[1]
Motor Racing Network
[
edit
]
After MRN took over RacingOne.com in 2009, Pistone joined the network as a writer and pit reporter.
[1]
His first race for the radio network was a Camping World Truck Series race at
Martinsville Speedway
.
[1]
He says of the event that he "didn't sleep the night before and had memorized every driver, team, sponsor and piece of data I could get my hands on, even though I was working P3 and in reality had about 11 trucks to cover. I had Rick Crawford as my pre-race interview target because he was making an historic start in his career and let me tell you when Barney Hall gave the wind-up and said 'Rick's standing by with our Pete Pistone of Chicago, Illinois' I nearly lost it. Thankfully the words formed for my question and Rick, the nicest guy in the world, started his answer by welcoming me to the MRN family. The rest of the broadcast went well and I will always remember being on pit road with Alex Hayden and Steve Post plus working with Barney, Joe Moore and Dave Moody that day as a highlight in my life."
[1]
Sirius XM
[
edit
]
Since July 6, 2009, Pistone has been the co-host of
The Morning Drive
on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio with
Mike Bagley
.
[1]
He took over as co-host following the death of David Poole.
[1]
Even before joining the Sirius XM lineup, he had been a weekly guest on
Sirius XM Speedway
with
Dave Moody
since 2004. On Saturday mornings during the season, he co-hosts a show that helps callers set a lineup for fantasy NASCAR events. In addition to Sirius XM NASCAR, Pistone is a regular guest/host on Sirius XM Bleacher Report Radio where he discusses NASCAR and stick and ball sports.
Unlike his co-host Bagley, Pistone is known for being snarky and having a low tolerance for nonsense like his other MRN colleague Moody.
Personal life
[
edit
]
Pistone resides in a suburb near the city of Chicago with his wife Michelle and daughter Mia. Being a lifelong fan of the
Chicago Cubs
, he also works as a Cubs beat reporter for
MLB.com
.

Drakensang: The River of Time
is a role-playing video game developed by Radon Labs. Drakensang TROT is the second video game in
The Dark Eye
-universe since
Attic's
Northlands Trilogy from the 1990s (
Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny
,
Realms of Arkania: Star Trail
and
Realms of Arkania: Shadows over Riva
).
Story
[
edit
]
Though released after
Drakensang: The Dark Eye
, and playable as stand-alone game, in-story it serves as a prequel. The game takes place around the city of Nadoret. Nadoret lies south of the city of Ferdok, the main hub of the first installment. From Nadoret the player travels the Great River to reveal a series of pirate attacks. Over the course of the game he teams up with Ardo of Boarstock, the thief Cuano and the dwarf Forgrimm, who also appeared in
Drakensang: The Dark Eye
.
Gameplay
[
edit
]
Just like the original Drakensang, it has a traditional RPG party-based style, with a 'real-time with pause' round-based playmode as seen in games like
Baldur's Gate
or
Neverwinter Nights
.
[2]
[3]
Using a largely faithful version of the pen and paper rules, statistics, skills and talents are leveled up through universal experience points which can be applied to anything from skills which increase the amount of information found on the minimap to skills useful for combat or negotiation.  The River of Time also addressed minor criticisms of the first game, such as the player's inability to return to most areas once completed.
It was released in Germany in February 2010, followed by an expansion pack called
Phileasson's Secret
in August 2010. It was released in English in January 2011,

Phileasson's Secret in May 2011.

[6]
It won the "Best RPG 2010" at the

.
[7]
However, this second game of the franchise did not fare well financially, and subsequently Radon Labs were declared bankrupt
[8]
and acquired by
Bigpoint Games
.
[9]
The Drakensang brand was then turned into an online browser game franchise, that no longer connects to The Dark Eye franchise.

Wolverhampton Wanderers
[
edit

Hinton started his career in the youth ranks at
Wolverhampton Wanderers
in October 1959, before making his senior debut on 7 January 1961 in a 1-1 draw with
Huddersfield Town
in the
FA Cup
.
[

He came into the Wolves team during the
1961-62 season
when he managed 16 appearances, scoring 5 times. The following season, he was a first choice in the wide left position, from where he netted 19 times, making him their leading goalscorer. He also won a call-up to the
England team
during this season when he played against
France
on 3 October 1962 in a
European Championship qualifier
at
Hillsborough
.
[3]
Nottingham Forest
[
edit
]
Johnny Carey
became Forest manager in 1963 signing Hinton in January 1964. Carey assembled a team including Hinton,
Ian Storey-Moore
, and
Joe Baker
that for a long spell went largely unchanged in challenging for the
1966-67 Football League
title. They beat title rivals
Manchester United
4-1 at the
City Ground
on 1 October 1966. The 3-0 win against Aston Villa on 15 April had Forest second in the table a point behind United. Injuries eventually took effect meaning Forest had to settle for being League Runners-up and losing in the
1966-67 FA Cup
semi-final to
Dave Mackay
's
Tottenham Hotspur
. After missing out on both trophies, Hinton left in September of the following season. Hinton appeared 112 times for Forest scoring 24 goals.
His time with Forest also saw him earn two further
England
caps, in a 2-2 draw with
Belgium
- in which he scored - and a 2-1 win over
Wales
, both in 1964.
Derby County
[
edit
]
He was then signed by
Brian Clough
for
Derby County
(local rivals of Forest) in September 1967 for
£
30,000. He spent eight seasons with the
Rams
, which coincided with the golden period in the club's history, winning promotion to the top flight as
Second Division
champions in
1968-69
and then winning the league championship in both
1971-72
and
1974-75
. He departed in 1975 after 253 appearances and 63 goals for Derby. Whilst at Derby he was universally and affectionately known, amongst the fans by his nickname `Gladys` which stemmed from his aforementioned white boots and curly blonde perm, along with his elegant and non-aggressive playing style.

Personal life
[
edit
]
After retiring from coaching, Hinton turned to a career in real estate, while remaining involved in youth soccer. He served as a local broadcast analyst for
Seattle Sounders
. His nephew,
Craig
, is also a professional footballer.
On 18 November 2014 Hinton tweeted that his bladder cancer had returned and that he would have major surgery on 7 January 2015. A few weeks later he tweeted that the pathology results showed him to be "clear".
[4]
On 1 June 2020, Hinton tweeted controversial remarks about black soccer players that led to Sounders FC officially ending a 40-year relationship with him.

King of Space
is a work of
electronic literature
by author
Sarah Smith
and Mark Bernstein, originally published in 1991. This interactive narrative is set in a collapsing solar system aboard an abandoned starship, where an escaped terrorist encounters the last star-captain and his ship's Priestess. The story weaves elements of gaming into a dark science-fictional ritual of fertility and regeneration.
Origins
[
edit
]
King of Space
[
edit
]
King of Space
was influenced by the literary and digital landscape of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Sarah Smith initiated the work in 1988 (text) and collaborated with Mark Bernstein (programming). Published in 1991 by Eastgate Systems, Inc., this collaborative effort between writer and programmer contributed to the unique interactive nature of the narrative.  During production, the creators saw
King of Space
as a test piece for technology and what could be possible when technology influences the narrative.
[1]
King of Space: Reconstruction of a Narrative Game
[
edit
]
In 2022, students from the
WSU Vancouver
Creative Media & Digital Culture (CMDC) program undertook a comprehensive reconstruction of the original 1991 game
King of Space
, this was called
King of Space: Reconstruction of a Narrative Game
.
[2]
This reconstruction involved a ground-up overhaul, incorporating new art and illustrations, multiple mini-games, interactive environments, and complex gameplay, breathing new life into this interactive narrative experience.
Plot
[
edit
]
Set within the confines of the abandoned starship, known as the Greatship, amidst a plague-ridden and divided solar system. Tam Rosse, an escaped terrorist, repeatedly meets the last star captain and the enigmatic Priestess, with their relationships oscillating between adversaries, comrades, and lovers.
Characters
[
edit
]
● Tam Rosse, twenty-three, the POV character for three out of the five stories
● Lady Nii, the intelligence of the Greatship
● King Brady, the last survivor of the Greatship
● Aster, eighteen, a Priestess now on her first assignment
Story structure and navigation
[
edit
]
The story initially follows a linear path but continually presents readers with crossroads that lead to multiple branching paths, all determined by the reader's choices. As the narrative progresses, readers encounter pivotal decision points where their choices influence the direction of the story.
In the 2022 version of the game, a range of enhancements has been introduced to heighten reader immersion. These include the integration of new art and illustrations, the inclusion of multiple mini-games, and the creation of interactive environments. These additions offer readers a more immersive and engaging narrative experience, allowing them to delve deeper into the story and explore its diverse possibilities.
Publication History
[
edit
]
King of Space
was originally published by
Eastgate Systems, Inc.
during a period when color and robust media in electronic literature were still emerging technologies. Despite the limitations of the time, the work offered a media-rich environment, featuring bitmapped images by artist Matthew Mattingly, 8-bit music by Michael Derzhinsky, and 2D animations by Mattingly, Bernstein, and others. This early form of interactive media comprised 317 screens of text and presented readers with 25 different possible endings.
Literary significance and critical reception
[
edit
]
Sarah Smith's
King of Space
has been stated as a notable example of early electronic literature and science fiction in the digital medium.
[3]
With it also being regarded for its innovation in blending text with animation, mazes, puzzles, and games, showcasing the possibilities of hypertext.
[4]
Others have also gone on to say that the work defies conventional categorization, reflecting the distinct nature of digital storytelling, where the roles of author and reader are clearly differentiated.

Ernest François Eugène Douwes Dekker
also known as
Setyabudi
or
Setiabudi
(8 October 1879 - 28 August 1950) was an
Indonesian
-
Dutch
nationalist
and politician of
Indo
descent. He was related to the famous Dutch anti-colonialism writer
Multatuli
, whose real name was Eduard Douwes Dekker ("Douwes Dekker" being their surname). In his youth, he fought in the
Second Boer War
in South Africa on the
Boer
side. His thoughts were highly influential in the early years of the Indonesian freedom movement.
After Indonesian independence, he adopted the
Sundanese
name
Danoedirdja Setiaboedi
.
Early years
[
edit
]
Douwes Dekker was born in
Pasuruan
, in the north east of
Java
, 80 km south of
Surabaya
. His father was Auguste Henri Edouard Douwes Dekker, a broker and bank agent,
[1]
of a Dutch family living in the then-
Dutch East Indies
.  His
Indo (Eurasian)
mother was Louisa Margaretha Neumann, of half-
German
and half-
Javanese
descent. Douwes Dekker's great-uncle was the famous writer
Eduard Douwes Dekker
, author of
Max Havelaar
.
[2]
After studying in Lower School in Pasuruan, he moved to Surabaya, and later to
Batavia
. In 1897, he gained his diploma and worked on a coffee
plantation
in
Malang
,
East Java
. Later he moved to a sugar
plantation
in
Kraksaan
,
East Java
. During his years in these plantations, he came in contact with ordinary
Javanese
and saw the realities of their hard work.
[1]
Second Boer War
[
edit
]
In 1900, along with his brothers Julius and Guido, he decided to
volunteer
for service in the
Second Boer War
.
[2]
They arrived in
Transvaal
, and became citizens of that state.
[1]
He based his actions on the belief that the
Boers
were victims of
British
expansionism, and as a fellow descendant of the Dutch, he was obliged to help. In the course of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in an internment camp on
Ceylon
.
Dekker was later released and returned to the Dutch East Indies via
Paris
in 1903.
Indonesian struggle
[
edit
]
Plaque made by JC Wienecke in Bandung with an image of Ernest François Eugène Douwes Dekker, cousin of Multatuli, pseudonym of Eduard Douwes Dekker.
In the Dutch East Indies, Dekker, then still in his twenties, started a career as a journalist, first in
Semarang
and later in
Batavia
. There he worked with
Indo
activist
Karel Zaalberg
, the chief editor of the newspaper
Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad
, whom he befriended. On 5 May 1903, he married Clara Charlotte Deije, who would bear him three children. Unlike other people of European descent, he did not favour
colonialism
, strongly advocating self-management, and finally the independence, of the Dutch East Indies. This was prompted partly by his experience in watching the lives of plantation workers and partly by the discrimination he had suffered, through being only considered half-Dutch and a second-class citizen.
During these times, he published many articles advocating independence, and "Indies nationalism."
[3]
In 1913, close associates of Douwes Dekker, including physicians
Tjipto Mangunkusumo
and
Suwardi Surjaningrat
, established the Native Committee in
Bandung
, which later became the
Indische Partij
.
[1]
[4]
This was considered a breakthrough because most organisations had never so openly advocated independence. In March 1913, the party claimed approximately 7000 members, approximately 5500 of whom were
Indos
(people of mixed Dutch-Indonesian ancestry) along with 1500 native Indonesians. The Colonial government quickly became worried, and the party was forbidden. This led to the
exile
to the
Netherlands
of Douwes Dekker and his two Javanese associates.
In exile, they worked with liberal Dutchmen and compatriot students. It is believed that the term
Indonesia
was first used in the name of an organization, the Indonesian Alliance of Students, with which they were associated during the early 1920s.
[3]
After his party was forbidden it directly inspired the foundation of the
Insulinde
and an
Indo
-European party named '
Indo Europeesch Verbond
' chaired by his friend
Karel Zaalberg
and also advocated independence. Many of the former 'Indische Partij' members joined the new party that grew to 10.000 members.
[5]
In 1918 he was allowed to return to the East Indies and was responsible for reforming the 'Insulinde' into the new 'National Indische Party' (NIP). Together with his new associate
P.F. Dahler
and old companion
Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo
, he became a prominent leader of the NIP.  After the NIP was involved in the
Surakarta
farmers' strike, he was imprisoned again by the colonial authorities in 1921.
[6]
After his release from prison in 1922, he taught in Bandung in a lower school. Two years later, as head of the school, he renamed it the "Ksatrian Institute." The government officially recognised this institute in 1926. In the same year, he married Johanna Mussel, one of its teachers, six years after divorcing his first wife.
Sukarno
was a teacher at one of his schools.
[7]
Later, however, his activities were branded illegal, and in 1936 he was condemned to three months in prison.
[1]
He was still actively advocating independence and sharing his thoughts with other intellectuals, among them
Sukarno
, who considered Douwes Dekker as his teacher.
[2]
Later, however, his influence was overshadowed by the politics of his student Sukarno's
Indonesian National Party
(PNI), Islamist
Sarekat Islam
, and
Communist Party of Indonesia
.
During
World War II
, Dutch authorities, who considered him a dangerous activist, exiled him, along with many Indo-European of
German
descent, to
Suriname
.
[2]
He would spend years in a forest prison camp called
Jodensavanne internment camp
.
Dekker returned to Indonesia on 2 January 1947.
Later years
[
edit
]
After he returned to Indonesia, he was appointed a member of the provisional parliament, or
Komite Nasional Indonesia Pusat
(
Indonesian National Central Committee
). In February 1947, he changed his name to Danudirja Setiabudi which means 'powerful substance, faithful spirit.' In 1947 he divorced his second wife and married the
Indo European
author Nelly Alberta Kruymel, who had changed her name to Harumi Wanasita, in an Islamic ceremony.
[8]
In December 1948 he was lifted from his sickbed and arrested by Dutch troops, but released due to his poor health.
[6]
He spent his last years in Bandung, writing his autobiography,
70 Jaar Konsekwent
.
On his seventieth birthday to his delight, he witnessed the formal Dutch transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia in 1949. He died eight months later in 1950.
[8]
Legacy
[
edit
]
1962 Indonesian stamp in the series "National Heroes" featuring Dekker
In Dutch literature, he is portrayed as a tragic and misunderstood historical figure.
[8]
However, his legacy as a national hero is still appreciated in Indonesia. A district and a main street in
Jakarta
are named
Setiabudi
in his honour, as well as Setiabudi Utara station of
Transjakarta
Corridor 6
,
Setiabudi Astra station
of
Jakarta MRT
, and upcoming
Setiabudi station
of
Jabodebek LRT
serving the district. In Bandung, there is also a main street called
Setiabudi
, and another is named
Ksatrian
after his school.
He was recognized as
National Heroes of Indonesia
by President Sukarno.
His life is recorded in a biography, '
Het Leven van EFE Douwes Dekker
, by Frans Glissenaar in 1999.

Carli Lloyd has nine international hat-tricks, including one in the 2015 World Cup final.
The
United States women's national soccer team
played their first international
soccer
match on August 18, 1985, losing to
Italy
1-0 at the 1985
Mundialito
.
[1]
Since that first match, 28 U.S. international players have scored a
hat-trick
(three goals or more in a game).
[2]
[3]
The first player to accomplish the feat was
Carin Jennings
, who had three goals against
Japan
on June 1, 1988.
[4]
Nine players have scored five goals in a game:
Michelle Akers
,
Brandi Chastain
,
Crystal Dunn
,
Sydney Leroux

Carli Lloyd
,
Tiffany Milbrett
,
Alex Morgan
,
Amy Rodriguez

[6]
[7]
Four-goal performances have been achieved by seven players; Wambach and
Mia Hamm
each did so twice.
[2]
Multiple American players scored three goals or more in the same match on June 2, 2000, against
Canada
(Milbrett and
Cindy Parlow
);
[8]
September 8, 2002, against
Scotland
(Hamm and Wambach);

January 20, 2012, against the
Dominican Republic
(Rodriguez and
Heather O'Reilly
;
[10]
and December 18, 2014, against
Argentina
(Lloyd and
Christen Press
).
[11]
The record for the most international hat-tricks by a U.S. women's national team player is 10, by Hamm; she scored three goals in a match eight times, along with her two four-goal games.
[2]
Lloyd has nine hat-tricks; her ninth came in a 9-0 win against
Paraguay
on September 17, 2021, which was her five-goal performance.
[7]

Kirov
(
Russian
:
Ки́ров
,
IPA:
[ˈkʲirəf]
ⓘ
) is the largest
city
and
administrative center
of
Kirov Oblast
,
Russia
. It is located on the
Vyatka River
in
European Russia
, 896 kilometres (557 mi) northeast of
Moscow
. Its population was 518,348 in 2020, up to roughly 750 thousand residents in the urban agglomeration.
[14]
The city was previously known as
Vyatka
(Russian:
Вя́тка
,
IPA:
[[ˈvʲatka]]
), after the
Vyatka River
, until 1934,
[3]
[2]
and as
Khlynov
(
Хлы́нов
) from 1457 to 1780.
[2]
It was renamed
Kirov
after Bolshevik
Sergei Kirov
in 1934, even though he never visited the city.
Kirov was the center of
Vyatka Land
which was settled by Russians during the
Middle Ages
.
It is an important economic, transportation, industrial, educational and cultural center in
Volga-Vyatka region
. It is also home to the many Russian folk crafts, such as
Dymkovo toys
, vyatka lace and carving on a capa-root. In the historic part of the city there are many universities, theaters, museums and churches.
[15]
[16]
[17]
[18]
The city was founded in 1374 (according to other sources in 1181), which makes it one of the oldest cities in Russia.
[19]
[20]
History
[
edit
]
Principality and republic
[
edit
]
Main article:
Vyatka Land
The native Slavic tribe in
Central Russia
and the
Volga region
, the
Vyatichi
(also called Viatichi), mixed here with the
Novgorodian Slovenes
and
Finno-Ugric
peoples.
[21]
According to the "Tale of the Vyatka Country", the city was founded on the Balaskov Field either in 1181 or in 1199. Based on archaeological data, the emergence of the city should be attributed to the middle-end of the 13 century.
[19]
[20]
Kirov itself was first mentioned (as Vyatka) for the first time in 1374,
[3]
when Novgorodian
ushkuyniks
plundered it on their way to
Bolghar
.
[22]
Vyatka was governed by a public assembly (
veche
) like the other northern Russian republics of
Pskov
and
Novgorod
.
At different times in the late 14th and 15th centuries, Vyatka militias raided
Ustyug
,
Novgorod
and Tatar lands in the
Kama
and
Volga
regions.
In 1412, a battle took place near the city between the Vyatchans and Ustyuzhans. The battle took place at night in a ravine, later named Razderikhinsky. According to one version, the Ustyuzhans came to the aid of the Vyatchans for defense against the Tatars, according to another, they, in alliance with the Moscow princes, wanted to capture the city. In memory of those events, the Vyatka folk festival "Svistoplyaska" appeared, and a chapel in the name of Archangel Michael was built on the bank of the ravine.
[15]
Vyatka supported
Yury of Zvenigorod
during the
Muscovite Civil War
, and after his party lost to the victorious
Vasily II
, the Muscovite armies were sent twice to subjugate Vyatka until it was eventually forced to accept the suzerainty of Moscow, while retaining a significant amount of autonomy.
[23]
In 1469, Vyatka allied with
Khan Ibrahim
of the
Khanate of Kazan
and did not take part in the campaign of
Ivan III
against the khanate.
[24]
[23]
Until the end of the 15 century, Vyatka land was a self-governing territory. The People's Assembly acted as the main governing body. The most influential group of the feudal class were the boyars, followed by merchants and clergy. The rest of the Vyatchans represented the free communal population and consisted of peasants and artisans.
[15]
[25]
After several unsuccessful campaigns by Moscow against Vyatka in the 1480s, the latter was finally annexed in 1489.
[23]
Tsarist Russia
[
edit
]
In the 17 century, the military significance of Khlynov was replaced by trade: merchants from Siberia, the Urals, Pomerania and other regions came here for the Semenovskaya Fair.
[26]
In 1657, the Vyatka Diocese was established. It was here that the Vyatka chronicles were created. The Kremlin was completely rebuilt during the reign of
Alexis of Russia
. Under his son

On the eve of the
February Revolution
, there was no particular aggravation of the social and political struggle in Vyatka province and Vyatka. The
October revolution
of the Bolsheviks in
Petrograd
was declared illegal, the provincial governorate remained loyal to the Provisional Government.
[25]
The Bolsheviks, until the end of the autumn of 1917, had neither wide fame nor great influence in the city. The arriving detachments of soldiers and sailors, together with local Red Army, played a decisive role in the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, which did not happen immediately.

The destruction of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral
In the 1930s, the destruction of the temple city architecture began. The ensemble of the city Kremlin has been almost completely lost. In 1931 the Holy Trinity Cathedral was destroyed, in 1937 the Alexander Nevsky was blown up. Many temples managed to survive, but they were rebuilt for other, non-religious needs. Thus, the Spassky Cathedral and the Trifonov Monastery lost their towers. The Cathedral mosque, underwent the same process. In the future, the appearance of these buildings will be restored.
[25]
On 1934, regular public transport appeared in the city for the first time.
[28]
In December 1934, it was renamed after the Soviet communist party functionary
Sergey Kirov
, who was assassinated on December 1, who was born in nearby
Urzhum
, despite him never visiting the city himself.
[25]
During the
Second World War
, due to the evacuation of machine-building plants from Moscow and Leningrad, the Kirov industry was mainly formed.

Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates: And a Thousand Cocktails
.
[4]
[5]

Plot
[
edit
]
Brothers Mike and Dave Stangle are liquor salesmen whose antics ruin their family's gatherings. With their younger sister Jeanie's wedding in
Hawaii
approaching, their parents tell them they must bring dates to the wedding to keep them out of trouble. Mike and Dave put out an ad for dates on Craigslist. The ad goes viral and the brothers go on
The Wendy Williams Show
to advertise themselves.
Meanwhile, Tatiana and Alice are slacker party girls who have just been fired from their waitressing jobs. After seeing the brothers' appearance on television, Tatiana decides that this free trip is just the vacation they need, and they clean themselves up. While the brothers are at a bar, Tatiana—to get their attention—throws herself in front of a moving car outside the bar. After the girls let the brothers think Mike saved Tatiana's life, they all go on a date. Tatiana, posing as a school teacher, flirts with Mike but has no intention of having sex with him. Alice, who is pretending to be a
hedge fund
manager, thinks sleeping with Dave is just what she needs to get over her ex-fiancé, who left her at the altar. Thinking their family will like the girls, the brothers invite them to Hawaii.
In Hawaii, Tatiana and Alice charm the Stangle family. Dave finds himself falling for Alice, while Mike and his
bisexual
female cousin, Terry, begin competing for Tatiana's attention. The girls convince Jeanie and her fiancé, Eric, to take an ATV tour through the mountains. Alice and Tatiana show off and perform tricks on their ATVs; Mike attempts the same trick but ends up crashing into Jeanie, which severely bruises her face. Feeling bad for Jeanie, Alice bribes a masseur to give Jeanie a massage with a tantric style "happy ending" to help her relax.
Tatiana goes into a sauna and runs into Terry, who offers her backstage passes to
Rihanna
if Tatiana fingers her. Meanwhile, Mike walks in on Jeanie having an orgasm during the massage. Upon finding Tatiana and Terry together, Mike and Terry fight, and Tatiana accidentally admits the girls are only interested in the free vacation. Dave and Alice connect on a walk, where she tells him she was left at the altar. When Mike tells Dave the truth about the girls, they disagree over how to handle the situation.
At the rehearsal dinner, Jeanie opens up to Alice over her fears about getting married and Eric being boring. To help calm her nerves, Alice gives her
ecstasy
. Mike drags Dave backstage and demands he practice their speech instead of spending more time with Alice. They get into an argument, and Mike reveals what happened in the massage parlor—unaware that they are being broadcast over the speaker system. The argument gets physical in front of the entire wedding party, ruining the rehearsal dinner.
High on ecstasy, Jeanie and Alice get naked and release a stable of horses, while Tatiana apologizes to Mike; they relate over how similar they are. After yelling at Alice, Dave gets them both back to the resort, where Eric, mad about the massage, calls off the wedding. The next day, the brothers make up and agree to work together to get the wedding back on track. At the same time, Tatiana and Alice feel guilty and also agree to fix the wedding. All four of them go to Jeanie and Eric's room to apologize, which ends in an argument over who is more at fault. Eric silences and berates all of them, and gives Jeanie an early honeymoon present: tickets for a hot air balloon ride, which Jeanie wanted for their honeymoon even though Eric is afraid of heights. With the wedding back on, the four scramble to get a venue and food for the reception.
Jeanie and Eric end up getting married outside the stables. After the wedding, Tatiana and Mike decide to get into business together. Alice deletes her wedding video before making out with Dave. The brothers perform a heartfelt duet to celebrate Jeanie's marriage; Alice and Tatiana then join them for a raunchy dance number. The fireworks display the brothers set off catches fire, scattering the wedding party. Tatiana and Mike later have sex in the stables.

Critical response
[

On
Rotten Tomatoes
, the film has an approval rating of 38% based on 170 reviews, with an average rating of 4.77/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
benefits from the screwball premise and the efforts of a game cast, even if the sporadically hilarious results don't quite live up to either."
[16]
On
Metacritic
, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
[17]
Audiences polled by
CinemaScore
gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.
[18]
Aubrey Plaza
's performance was particularly praised, and is often noted as a highlight of the film.
The Guardian
wrote, "
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
is very much an ensemble comedy, but much like
A Fish Called Wanda
earned
Kevin Kline
the Oscar, Plaza’s ineffable style of comedy (which weirdly teeters between broad farce and muted disinterest) suits the material so perfectly she leaves the others in the dust."
[19]
Variety
stated "where the comedy really takes off, Aubrey Plaza, who was so sharp playing a good girl pretending to be bad in
The To Do List
, is even sharper playing a bad girl pretending to be good. She’s got a face made for deception — she’s like a devil doll, eyebrows lowering with cunning — and her line readings are killer."

) land.
[2]
It is famous for housing the
Grolar Bear
.

This brought about many scientific inquiries into the zoo.
[4]
865,000 visitors visited the zoo in 2010.
History
[
edit
]
The Osnabrück Zoo was founded as a home zoo in July 1935 and opened on July 26, 1936.
Zoo friends had come together in the "Community of Friends of the Home Zoo". The plan to found a zoo in Osnabrück was put into practice with the help of donations. The first animals were a
badger
, a
fox
and a
bear
. An aviary, an
owl
tower, a
deer
and
roe deer
gate and an aquarium followed a little later. In 1938 the first bears arrived in the still small zoological garden.
In April 1945, as a result of the
Second World War
, the number of animals in the home zoo was very low, the zoo was badly damaged and in debt. The ambitions were still great after the war, so the “Heimattiergarten” was renamed “Tiergarten” in 1947 and the first monkeys moved in. In 1959 and 1960 a warm house, a
penguin
enclosure and the first elephant house were built. On April 17, 1961, the first
Indian elephant
cow
Toni
, bought by the William Althoff circus, moved in. A week later the cow
Targa
joined them. In 1968 the antelope enclosure was opened. In 1970 the
Tiergarten Osnabrück
was renamed
Zoo Osnabrück
. The sea lion enclosure was built in 1973 and the South America area was opened in 1975, funded by the Wilhelm Karmann Foundation. A multi-purpose warm house, which opened in May 1975, burned down on the night of January 3 to 4, 1978 due to chewed electrical lines, killing dozen animals and causing property damage of around two million
Deutsche Marks
.
From 1980 onwards, there were a number of new buildings, renovations and extensions with the focus on animal welfare and the aim of developing the zoo into a nature adventure park with individual themed landscapes. In 1986 the new entrance area with the administration and the attached natural history
Museum am Schölerberg
was opened. In 1988 and 1989 a tropical hall, the aquarium, a new penguin enclosure and an expanded outdoor enclosure for the great apes were built. The new elephant park was completed in 1998.
From March 22 to April 4, 2001, the Osnabrück Zoo, like the neighboring zoos in
Münster
and
Rheine
, closed due to the
foot-and-mouth disease
that broke out in the neighboring
Netherlands
. The measure was intended to protect the animal population from the epidemic and prevent further spread.
In 2004, the opening of the
Samburu
landscape took place. Giraffes live here with zebras, ostriches and other African animals. In September 2006, Suma, a female
orangutan
, who over time had become a favorite of the zoo's public, died. In 2007, the elephant and rhinoceros enclosure were combined into one landscape, the
Valley of the Grey Giants
. In March 2009, the Osnabrück Zoo was expanded to include a unique underground zoo. In June 2010, the 5.5 hectare
Takamanda
African area opened, for which the zoo grounds were expanded to the south (
Autobahn 30
). The cost of this project was ten million euros. In July 2011, the new taiga landscape
Kajanaland
was opened. The investment costs amounted to 2.9 million euros.
For the 75th anniversary of the zoo, the Prime Minister of
Lower Saxony
,
David McAllister
, opened the exhibition of the
United Buddy Bears - The Minis
, together with Mayor
Boris Pistorius
and Zoo President Reinhard Coppenrath; an "Campaign for Peace and Tolerance" that generated donations of 120,000 euros that will benefit the zoo and children's facilities. In May 2012, a new facility for
Southern pig-tailed macaques
was opened. A temple based on the model of
Angkor Wat
was built in the center of the zoo. The opening of the interactive climate exhibition
Klimatopia
with the climate ambassadors and mascots
Tips
and
Taps
, two
hybrid bears
born in the Osnabrück Zoo, took place on April 11, 2013. The new tiger enclosure was opened in April 2014. Like the pig monkey enclosure that opened in 2012, it is designed in the style of an Asian temple complex. In September 2017, the inauguration of the third section of the
Angkor Wat
area took place with the renovation and expansion of the ape house and the enclosure of the popular orangutan "Buschi". The “Wir für Buschi” fundraising campaign alone contributed a third of the costs, amounting to 1.5 million euros.
In the Northeast of the zoo, the North American landscape of
Manitoba
was opened in October 2018. In September 2017, the first
wood bison
moved into their 3800 square meter outdoor area. The rhinoceros and lion enclosures will probably be rebuilt by the end of 2020 and combined to form a common themed area,
Mapungubwe
. Following this, the new
Water Worlds
theme area for sea lions, seals and penguins is to be built by 2022. After that, the elephant enclosure will be renewed, which would have renewed all of the zoo's large enclosures since 2004. The groundbreaking ceremony for the
Water Worlds
took place in May 2021, and completion is scheduled for mid-2022. The construction of the facility was secured by additional funding from the State of Lower Saxony in the amount of around 800,000 euros after the zoo had to struggle with financial losses due to the
COVID-19 pandemic
.
Incident in March 2017
[
edit
]
Hybrid bear "Tips" in 2006
On March 11, 2017, around 2:15 p.m., the hybrid bear
Tips
broke out of the enclosure in the Kajanaland area, opened in 2011, where she had lived with her brother
Taps
. Visitors made the zoo staff aware of the runaway she-bear, who was moving towards the entrance to the park. The approx. 4000 zoo visitors were warned by announcements and brought to safety in animal houses. On her foray, the she-bear knocked over an employee who was hardly injured. Zoo workers tried unsuccessfully to calm the animal. When the bear went on to attack the employees, she was shot. The zoo then explained that an anesthetic would only take effect after 10 to 20 minutes.
The other bear stayed in the enclosure and was locked in its stall until further notice. On the same day, the zoo was reopened to visitors, with the exception of the area around the bear enclosure.
The investigation of the outbreak traces revealed that the she-bear, which had recently ended its hibernation, first overcame an electric fence when it broke out. Then she squeezed through an opening that was only about 40 cm in size, which connects the bear enclosure with the adjoining silver fox enclosure. Then she bent an element of the enclosure fence with her body weight, which she finally escaped. In response to the incident, the zoo subjected its enclosures and visitor facilities to a security review.
In November 2017, the zoo decided to make the previously frozen animal body of the female bear available to the
State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart
for further research into the hybrid formation between polar and brown bears.

A replica of a megalithic grave has been located on the western edge of the zoo since the 1980s. For the replica, stones from one of the large stone graves near Nahne were moved to the zoo. However, since 2011, when the area was redesigned to today's Kajanaland and the route was changed, the grave has no longer been directly accessible to visitors.
Reception
[
edit
]
In the rankings of European zoos by British zoo expert Anthony Sheridan, Osnabrück Zoo reached the top places in the group several times with 500,000 to 1 million visitors annually. The zoo was in second place in the 2011 and 2013 rankings and in 2015 was tied with the
Münster Allwetterzoo
in third place.
In a customer survey conducted by Service Value GmbH in 2012, in which visitors from 20 German zoos were asked about the service they experienced, Osnabrück Zoo took first place.

The School of the Art Institute of Chicago
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Gregg Bordowitz was born August 14, 1964, in
Brooklyn
, New York. In 1982, Bordowitz began his academic career at the
School of Visual Arts
, then studied at the
Whitney Museum
Independent Study Program from 1985 to 1986, and at
New York University
from 1986 to 1987. In 1987, Bordowitz dropped out of school to become a full-time video artist, guerilla TV director, and activist with the direct action advocacy group
ACT UP
.
[1]
During this time, Bordowitz was central to the formation of the notable video activist collective, Testing the Limits, who produced work documenting AIDS activism that were distributed through television, museums, schools, and community centers. He also wrote prolifically on the topic of AIDS activism, contributing heavily to the 1987 "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism" of the well-respected academic journal
October
. In 1988, Gregg Bordowitz tested positive for
HIV
and, as a result, came out as a
homosexual
man to his mother and stepfather. He left Testing the Limits (now a self-sufficient non-profit entity) to focus on a more 'guerilla' approach to documenting AIDS activism. In 1988, he met video artist
Jean Carlomusto
at a demonstration partnered with her to produce the
Gay Men's Health Crisis
(GMHC) cable TV show
Living With AIDS
, which ran regularly until 1994.
[2]
In 1989, he, along with numerous other video activists, formed
DIVA
(Damned Interfering Video Activists), a partner organization to ACT UP, dedicated to accurately documenting the protests organized by ACT UP and providing an alternative representation of the AIDS activist movement than the one presented by the
mainstream media
.
In 1993, filled with despair at the decline of AIDS activism as well as his own diminishing chances of survival, Bordowitz produced one of his most famous pieces, the documentary/montage
Fast Trip, Long Drop
. In this video, Bordowitz addresses the public's reaction to and representation of the
AIDS epidemic
as well as his own fears, insecurities, and struggles related to the disease.
Fast Trip, Long Drop
provides a pessimistic counterpoint to the flood of representations of people "Surviving and Thriving" with AIDS through a collage of documentary footage, staged parody, and vintage film clips. For the first time in an AIDS-related documentary, people with AIDS were shown addressing and coming to terms with the ever-present fact of their own mortality. As Bordowitz explains in his 1999 interview with the AIDS art forum Artery, "When I made "Fast Trip, Long Drop" I was tired of pretending for the sake of others that I would survive. I became preoccupied with the burdens that sick people bear on behalf of those around them who are well. I wanted to get a handle on despair and put it out there as a political problem. To be recognized and discussed. If we couldn't do this, then it all seemed like bullshit. I wanted an honest media produced in the interests of people living with AIDS."
[3]
The film, along with many of his other works, has been shown in film festivals, museums, and on television ever since with extremely positive response.
From there, Bordowitz continued to address AIDS in his artwork, video work, and writing. He taught video art at the
Academy of Fine Arts Vienna
,
Brown University
, and
School of the Art Institute of Chicago
from 1995 to 2010, before being hired as a permanent professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His works have been shown at
the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
,
the Whitney Museum of American Art
, and
the Museum of Modern Art
, as well as numerous film festivals.
[4]
Bordowitz lives in Brooklyn with his long-term partner, the artist Kristine Woods.

Saint Varnava the New Confessor
(
Serbian
:
Свети Варнава Нови Исповедник
; 31 January 1914 - 12 November 1964) was the
titular bishop
of
Hvosno
and a saint of the
Serbian Orthodox Church
. His feast is October 30 on Julian Calendar. He is one of the
American Saints
along with
Alexis Toth
,
Alexander Hotovitzky
,
Herman of Alaska
,
Peter the Aleut
, and others.
He is also referred to as
Saint Varnava of Hvosno
(Свети Варнава Хвостански).
Life
[
edit
]
He was born
Vojislav Nastić
in
Gary
,
Indiana
, on January 31, 1914 into a family of Serbian immigrants. His parents were Atanasije and Zorka Nastić and the family attended the
St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church
of Gary, Indiana which is now located in
Merrillville
. Nastić was baptized there, later served as an
altar boy
, and was first recognized as a youthful prodigy in reciting Serbian traditional epic poetry.
[1]
[2]
While Nastić was still a child, the family returned to their homeland. He attended high school in
Sarajevo
, and graduating in 1933. He continued his education at the
University of Belgrade
's Faculty of Orthodox Theology, graduating in 1937. After graduating, he taught as a catechist in two high schools in Sarajevo.
In 1940, Nastić took
monastic vows
in
Mileševa Monastery
, receiving the
monastic name
Varnava (Barnabas). Varnava was
ordained
hierodeacon
by Metropolitan Bishop
Petar of Dabar-Bosna
. Varnava remained in Sarajevo during the
World War II
.
Croatian fascists
, however, tried to force him to join the
Croatian Orthodox Church
, which they had organized to subvert the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Varnava categorically refused this. Soon he had to leave Sarajevo in order to save his life.
[

]
After the war, he was ordained
hieromonk
and raised to the rank of
protosyncellus
by Bishop
Nektarije
of
Zvornik and Tuzla
. In its first regular session, the Holy Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church elected Varnava the
auxiliary bishop
to the
Serbian Patriarch
with the title Bishop of Hvosno, with the responsibility of administering the
Diocese of Dabar-Bosnia
. On 28 August 1947, he received the episcopal consecration by
Patriarch Gavrilo
,
[3]
bishop Nektarije, and bishop Vikentije of
Zletovo and Strumica
.
In his new position, bishop Varnava began openly criticizing the new communist regime for mistreating the church. He was soon arrested and sentenced to twenty years in prison. To support the accusation that he was an American spy, it was presented as evidence that he was teaching his sister English so she could be used as a spy for the Americans.
[
citation needed
]
Bishop  Varnava was subjected to torture, deprived of food, and was kept in the most isolated wing of the prison. But, he remained calm. Every day he sang the
troparia
and other hymns. The communist regime even arranged an accident in order to get rid of him in which he broke his leg.
[
citation needed
]
Although the communist secret police,
OZNA
, did not allow doctors to provide him any medical help, he recovered. He was released after this accident to house arrest in the
Gomionica Monastery
in the
Diocese of Banja Luka
until his release in 1960.
[
citation needed
]
He died on 12 November 1964, under suspicious circumstances, leading some historians to believe that he was poisoned by OZNA. In 2005, during the regular session of the Holy Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Bishop Varnava was canonized and his name was added to the list of other saints of the Serbian people and of Orthodox Christian faith.

Background
[
edit
]
Watkins Glen International
(nicknamed "The Glen") is an
automobile
race track
located in
Watkins Glen, New York
at the southern tip of
Seneca Lake
. It was long known around the world as the home of the
Formula One
United States Grand Prix
, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961-1980), but the site has been home to
road racing
of nearly every class, including the
World Sportscar Championship
,
Trans-Am
,
Can-Am
,
NASCAR Cup Series
, the
International Motor Sports Association
and the
IndyCar Series
.
Initially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the
6 Hours of Watkins Glen
. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the
1973 United States Grand Prix
. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the "Inner Loop" was installed in 1992 after
J.D. McDuffie's
fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event.
The circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers. The facility is currently owned by
International Speedway Corporation
.

Michele Morsero
(9 October 1895 - 2 May 1945) was an Italian
Fascist
politician and soldier,
prefect
of the
province of Vercelli
during the
Italian Social Republic
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Born in
Piedmont
in 1895, Morsero worked as an
accountant
and
tax consultant
. He was an
interventionist
and a volunteer in the
First World War
, after which he joined the
Fascist movement
, participating in the
march on Rome
and enlisting in the
Voluntary Militia for National Security
. He participated in the
Second Italo-Ethiopian War
with the rank of
primo seniore
(
Lieutenant Colonel
) in the 180th Blackshirt Legion "Alessandro Farnese", receiving a
silver medal for military valor
for his role in the
Second Battle of Tembien
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
He then participated in the
Spanish Civil War
in the ranks of the
Corps of Volunteer Troops
, commanding the "Laredo" Battalion of the
"Black Arrows" Brigade
, receiving two
War Crosses for Military Valor
. He then continued his career in the MVSN, reaching the rank of
console
(
Colonel
) in command of the 1st Blackshirt Legion "Sabauda" of
Turin
. In 1939 he became a member of the
Chamber of Fasces and Corporations
. After Italy's entry into the
Second World War
, he fought with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army and
console
of the MVSN on the
Albanian front
, at the head of the 141st Assault Blackshirt Legion "Volturno", part of the
51st Infantry Division Siena
.
[4]
[5]
[6]
[7]
After the
Armistice of Cassibile
, he joined the
Italian Social Republic
and was appointed federal secretary of the
Republican Fascist Party
(PFR) of
Lucca
. On 20 October 1943 he was replaced in this post by Mario Piazzesi, and on 27 October he was appointed second class prefect and entrusted the
province of Vercelli
; he immediately set out to rebuild the local section of the PFR, but obtained few adhesions. On November 25, Morsero, after a meeting with a delegation of workers from Vercelli, arranged for a fifty percent increase in
salary
, aimed at bringing "a decisive adjustment of
wages
to the real
cost of living
today".
Partisan
actions, initially bloodless, escalated later in the year, and on 2 December the fascists suffered their first casualties in an attack on the garrison of
Varallo Pombia
. Following this action, Morsero requested more troops from the RSI authorities and the German commands, in order to supplement the meager forces available to garrison the province; in mid-December industrial workers went on
strike
.
[8]
[9]
[10]
On 13 December 1943 Morsero wrote to the German command of Vercelli: "
I think it useful to inform you that the deplorable actions of the rebels increase day by day and cause very serious material damage as well as negatively affect the orientation of the population and therefore public order. It would be necessary to immediately react to each of their actions, but for the reasons that have already been explained several times, we do not have sufficient police forces to provide for it. I have requested men and weapons, but to date higher commanders have not been able to fulfill my requests. This situation worries me for defense national economy and for the assertion of prestige of the authorities. Please inform your superiors of the situation for appropriate intervention
." Following Morsero's requests, the RSI government sent the 1st Assault Legion "M" "Tagliamento" to the Vercelli area on 19 December. When an officer of the
GNR
autonomously raised irregular units to be used in "counter-band" actions, Morsero ordered him to withdraw them since action against the partisans had to take place with normal police actions.
[10]
[11]
Following a telegram signed by the Minister of the Interior
Guido Buffarini Guidi
who ordered the internment of
Jews
in special
concentration camps
, on 6 December Morsero ordered to act "with the utmost diligence and strict criteria" and instructed the mayor of Vercelli, Mario Busca, to set up a concentration camp at the Aravecchia farmhouse, which became operational on 24 December. On December 9, it was decided that seals were to be placed on Jewish homes.
[12]
[13]
On April 18, 1945, new strikes began, which soon spread to the entire province. With
the Allies advancing across the Po Valley
, the Italian Social Republic was on the brink of collapse and between 23 and 26 April all remaining troops of the Italian Social Republic gathered in Vercelli from the various garrisons of the province (as well as from neighbouring
Biella
), placing themselves under Morsero's command. Altogether, these troops numbered over two thousand, including several families of collaborators; grouped in the "Morsero column", they left Vercelli and headed towards
Novara
, with the intention of reaching the
Valtellina Redoubt
, but on 27 April they were stopped by the partisans near
Castellazzo Novarese
. After some clashes and long negotiations, Morsero and GNR Colonel Giovanni Fracassi surrendered the column to the partisans on 28 April. Morsero was then taken back to Vercelli, where he was tried and
sentenced to death
by a partisan court; he was executed by
firing squad
on 2 May 1945, along with the new mayor of Vercelli, Angelo Mazzucco, a police official and three Fascist Party officials.

Bywell Bridge
, two of the river spans with a flood arch beyond. The level of flooding can be seen by the
driftwood
caught above the
cutwater
A
flood arch
is a small supplemental
arch bridge
provided alongside a main bridge. It provides extra capacity for
floodwater
.
[1]
The space beneath a flood arch is normally dry and often carries a
towpath
or similar. In some cases it borders on the shallow edge of a river, but this does not carry substantial flow in normal conditions. A bridge with multiple arches across a flowing river would instead be termed a
viaduct
.
For some bridges, flood arches were added after the first bridge had been constructed, often after initial flooding.

Lichenaula provisa
is a
moth
in the family
Xyloryctidae
. It was described by
Thomas Pennington Lucas
in 1900. It is found in
Australia
, where it has been recorded from
Queensland
.
The
wingspan
is about 18 mm. The forewings are greyish white with fuscous specks, and markings of black and fuscous. There is a white blotch on the base having a black spot on the costa, and a black dash toward the hind inner margin, bordered by a transverse row of black dots. There is a white diffused patch covering two-fifths of the wing with an arched diffusion of the dots and splashes longitudinally through the centre to the inner margin at half. There is a line of six spots from the costa at two-fifths to the apex, becoming diffused into a fascia over the posterior three-fifths of the wing, irregularly marked with fuscous-black spots, and splashed with metallic copper. A white spur runs into this dark fascia halfway across the wing, immediately before the anal angle. There is a subterminal grey white line. The hindwings are ochreous white, with the veins grey, shaded with fuscous along the hindmargin.
Taxonomy
[

It was treated as a synonym of
Lichenaula phloeochroa
, but
DNA barcoding
has shown this species to be distinctly separate.

Plot
[
edit
]
The film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers, a set of violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating, while Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny's opinions. The chief suspect in Johnny's murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.
Ray and Chez swear revenge. Ray's wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez' wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband's obsessive nature.
Ray has Gaspare abducted for interrogation and they go to see Johnny's body. He is satisfied by Gaspare's claim of innocence, in part because he says that gangsters are superstitious, believing that the wounds of the corpse will start bleeding in the presence of the killer. Therefore the killer will not willingly enter the dead victim's presence. Gaspare is comfortable to be in the presence of the victim, so is not the killer. Ray releases Gaspare but instructs his men to murder him later.
As it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend. Ray's men identify him by tracking the car he had driven to commit the crime. Pressed by Ray, the killer confesses that he had wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends. Ray kills him.
As he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers' lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray's house and shoots and kills Ray and his two bodyguards. Chez then shoots Johnny, lying dead in the casket, before putting the gun in his own mouth and committing suicide as the family women wail over Ray's dying body.

In August 1928, the
U.S. state
of
Virginia
renumbered many of
its state highways
. This renumbering was caused by a new law that greatly increased the state highway mileage. The old system, in which three-digit routes were spurs of two-digit routes, was unwieldy for a large number of routes, and so a new system, in which three-digit routes were assigned by district, was adopted.

Production
[

Background
[
edit
]
SummerSlam
is an annual
pay-per-view
(PPV) produced every August by the
World Wrestling Federation
(WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed "The Biggest Party of the Summer",
[2]
it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with
Royal Rumble
,
WrestleMania
, and
Survivor Series
,
[3]
and was considered one of the "Big Five" PPVs, along with
King of the Ring
.
[4]
It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania.
[5]
[6]
The 2001 event was the 14th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 19, 2001, at the
Compaq Center at San Jose
in
San Jose, California
.
[7]
Storylines
[
edit
]
The main
rivalry
heading into SummerSlam was between
The Rock
and
Booker T
, battling over the
WCW Championship
. After losing the
WWF Championship
to
Steve Austin
at
WrestleMania X-Seven
, The Rock took a hiatus from
professional wrestling
to film the movie
The Scorpion King
.
[8]
On the July 9, 2001 edition of
Raw Is War
, campaigning for The Rock's return began.
[9]
[10]
Following the campaigning, The Rock returned to the WWF on the July 30, 2001 edition of
Raw Is War
, where he chose to align himself with the WWF instead of
The Alliance
for
The Invasion
.
[11]
[12]
This action was shown by The Rock delivering a
Rock Bottom
and the
People's Elbow
onto
Shane McMahon
, The Alliance leader.
[10]
[12]
Later that week on
SmackDown!
, Booker T and The Rock cut a
promo
, where Booker T challenged The Rock to a match at SummerSlam; the beginning of the Rock-Booker T rivalry.
[13]
[14]
Seeking revenge for the attack from the previous week, McMahon fought The Rock in a
Street Fight
on the August 6 edition of
Raw Is War
, where The Rock pinned McMahon. The rivalry between The Rock and Booker T intensified after the match, where Booker T and Shane McMahon
double-teamed
The Rock.
[15]
[16]
Later that week on
SmackDown!
, in retaliation, The Rock accepted Booker T's challenge.
[17]
[18]
On the August 13 edition of
Raw Is War
, The Rock was involved in a
tag team match
, where he teamed with
Chris Jericho
in a loss to Booker T and
Rhyno
.
[19]
[20]
After the match, Booker T delivered his variation of the Rock Bottom on The Rock, a move dubbed,
The Book End
.
[19]
[20]
On the final edition of
SmackDown!
before SummerSlam, McMahon announced that Booker T would defend the WCW Championship at SummerSlam against The Rock.
[21]
[22]
Later that night, the rivalry continued to intensify during a
Lights Out match
between Booker T and The Rock, after Booker T delivered a Book End onto The Rock through a commentators announce table.
[21]
[22]
The other main match on the card was
Stone Cold Steve Austin
versus
Kurt Angle
for the
WWF Championship
. The previous month at
Invasion
, Team
WCW
/
ECW
(
Booker T
,
Diamond Dallas Page
,
Rhyno
and
Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley
) defeated Team WWF (Austin, Angle, Chris Jericho,
The Undertaker and Kane
). Team WCW/ECW won after Austin
turned
on the WWF when he executed a
Stunner
on Angle. On the following night's edition of
Raw Is War
, Austin stated that he did this because he felt that
Vince McMahon
was grooming Angle to take over his spot, and that he was "unappreciated" when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin. Later that evening, Austin interfered during a six man
Elimination Tables match
by assaulting Angle. Then on the July 26, 2001 edition of
SmackDown!
, Angle appeared in his hometown of
Pittsburgh
and challenged Austin for the WWF Championship but Austin instead chose Booker T to defend his
WCW Championship
against Angle. Later on that night, Angle won the WCW Championship from Booker despite Austin's interference. On the July 30, 2001 edition of
Raw Is War
, Angle
lost
the WCW Championship back to Booker with the help of Austin and Shane McMahon. Afterwards, Angle challenged Austin for the WWF Championship at SummerSlam, which Austin accepted. The feud between Austin and Angle would escalate in the following couple of weeks leading up to SummerSlam especially in a
Six Man Tag Team Elimination match
pitting Austin and the Dudley Boyz against Angle and
The Hardy Boyz
, which Austin and the Dudley Boyz won.
Another main match heading into the event was
Jeff Hardy
versus
Rob Van Dam
in a
Ladder match
for the
WWF Hardcore Championship
. At
Invasion
Van Dam defeated Hardy to win the Hardcore Championship. In the following weeks, Van Dam and Hardy faced each other in
Tag Team matches
. On the August 13 edition of
Raw
, Van Dam was scheduled to defend his title against
Kurt Angle
, and as the match was underway, Hardy interfered and pinned Van Dam to win the title for himself. This led to a Ladder match for the title at SummerSlam between Hardy and Van Dam.

Reception
[
edit
]
In 2013, Dylan Diot of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 8.5 [Very Good], writing, "This was a damn good edition of Summerslam. Nothing on the show was bad and two of the matches were absolutely outstanding. [This] show is well worth a watch, especially for Angle's memorable performance and another classic ladder match. The Invasion angle may have [sucked], but at least the effort in the ring was great."
[24]
Aftermath
[
edit
]
This was the last SummerSlam to occur before the introduction of the first
brand extension
in March 2002, which split the roster between the
Raw
and
SmackDown!
brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform.
[25]
It was also the last SummerSlam event to occur under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002.
[26]
Additionally, King of the Ring was discontinued as a PPV following its
2002 event
, thus SummerSlam, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, reverted to being called the "Big Four" until October 2021 when
Money in the Bank
was recognized as one of the "Big Five".
[27]
With the WWF's purchase of rival company
World Championship Wrestling
(WCW) back in March, some of their titles became defended on WWF programming. As such, the 2001 event was the only SummerSlam to feature the
WCW Championship
, as the title was unified with the
WWF Championship
at December's
Vengeance
event with the latter being renamed to
Undisputed WWF Championship
. It was also the only SummerSlam to feature the
WCW Tag Team Championship
, which was unified with the
WWF Tag Team Championship
at
Survivor Series
in November. It was also the first SummerSlam to feature the
WCW Cruiserweight Championship
and the last to feature the
WWF Light Heavyweight Championship
, which was dropped in March 2002 in favor of continuing the Cruiserweight Championship, which was rebranded as a WWF title.

Waterbury
is a
town
in
Washington County
in central
Vermont
, United States. Although the town is still home to the
Waterbury Village Historic District
, the village sharing the name of the town officially dissolved as a municipality in 2018.
[3]
As of the
2020 census
, the population was 5,331.
[4]
History
[
edit
]
The location where Waterbury now lies was once the frontier between the
Mahican
and
Pennacook
people. European settlement of the area dates from 1763, when King
George III
granted a charter for land in the
Winooski River
valley. James Marsh became the first permanent white settler in the region in 1783. Many of the early settlers came from
Waterbury
,
Connecticut
, and named their new town in honor of the hometown.
[

The
village of Waterbury
was incorporated in 1882 with a population of over 2,000.
The
Central Vermont Railroad
came to Waterbury in 1849.
[5]
The railroad expanded a passenger station for the railroad in 1875, making the station a more major stop on the
Vermonter
.
[5]
The
Green Mountain Seminary
was built in
Waterbury Center
in 1869.
The state opened the Vermont State Asylum for the Insane here in 1891.
[6]
The hospital, renamed the
Vermont State Hospital
, grew to occupy over 40 buildings, but by the 1980s the number of patients had declined to the point where only one building was required. The remainder of the campus came to be used for state offices.
[7]
Like many
New England
towns, Waterbury's economy was based around the local river mill industry and the surrounding agricultural producers. The mills produced products such as
lumber
and finished wood products, wicker products, leather, starch, and alcohol. The agriculture was based on
sheep
through the 19th century but switched over to
dairy farming
by the 20th century. Waterbury had a ski factory in the 1940s, the Derby & Ball Company.
In 1927, Waterbury, like many other Vermont communities, was devastated by

. Inscriptions on the sides of some buildings in Waterbury village purport to show where the level of the water rose during the
1927 flood
. The village recovered, and in 1938 the
Waterbury Dam
was built on the Little River by the
Army Corps of Engineers
to control future flooding in areas downstream of the town center.
On August 29, 2011,
Tropical Storm Irene
flooded downtown Waterbury and filled the buildings of the
Vermont State Hospital
, Vermont's public psychiatric complex, with up to 6 feet (1.8 m) of water. Patients from the mental hospital were temporarily housed in various locations around Vermont, and over 1,100 of the 1,586 state employees were working in office space in other towns as of October 2011. The state was expected to decide by 2012 whether to relocate all or part of the workforce back to Waterbury.

The Summer House Sessions
is a live album by trumpeter
Don Cherry
. It was recorded in July 1968 at the summer home of musician and recording engineer Göran Frees in
Kummelnäs
,
Nacka
, Sweden, after Frees invited Cherry to visit for a series of jam sessions and rehearsals. (Frees would later record Cherry's
Organic Music Society
(1972) and
Eternal Now
(1974).)
[1]
[2]
[3]
On the album, which was released on LP and CD in 2021 by
Blank Forms Editions
with cover art by Cherry's wife
Moki
, Cherry blended members of two of his ensembles. From the Swedish band that recorded the album
Live in Stockholm
appear saxophonists
Bernt Rosengren
and Tommy Koverhult, bassist Torbjörn Hultcrantz, and drummer Leif Wennerström, while from Cherry's international group New York Total Music Company appear bassist
Kent Carter
and drummer Jacques Thollot. Hand drummer Bülent Ateş, who was visiting from Turkey, also participated. The CD release includes a second disc that features several additional musicians. Recordings from the session were presumed lost, but were located in the vaults of the Center for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research.
[1]
[2]
[3]
The music heard on
The Summer House Sessions
extends the "international" approach begun on Cherry's three
Blue Note
albums,
Complete Communion
,
Symphony for Improvisers
and
Where Is Brooklyn?
, "obliterating the borders of genre and enthusiastically mixing musical traditions from Asia, Africa and Latin America."
[4]
The album was issued as part of a larger 2021 retrospective of the Cherrys' collaborative work, which also involved two exhibits:
Organic Music Societies: Don and Moki Cherry
, presented in Brooklyn by Blank Forms, and
Moki Cherry, Communicate, How?: Tapestries and Paintings, 1967-1980
, sponsored by the Corbett vs. Dempsey Gallery in Chicago.
[4]
[5]
[6]
In addition, Blank Forms published a 496-page book titled
Organic Music Societies
, featuring essays, interviews, and other writings, as well as reproductions of Moki's art, and released a second album titled
Organic Music Theatre: Festival de jazz de Chateauvallon 1972
.

[10]
In a review for
Jazz Journal
, Elliot Marlow-Stevens wrote: "Capturing brilliant and organic improvisation,
The Summer House Sessions
offers a fascinating glimpse into Cherry's world of musical research and experimentation."
[9]
Giovanni Russonello, writing for
The New York Times
, stated: "The horn players all trade themes and motifs in a star burst of high-velocity improvising, sometimes coming together into cohesive, beboppish lines, like an ornate assemblage being thrown together on the roof of a fast-moving car."
[11]
In an article for
Point of Departure
, Gabriel Bristow noted the album's "exhilarating energy," and commented that it "sounds like summer. Something about the way it was recorded makes the music sounds like sunlight bouncing off rippling water." He remarked: "Ultimately this is a record of people at play. A serious experiment in the everyday art of living musically that was Cherry's life."
[12]
Elsewhere'
s
Graham Reid
wrote: "Because of the international make-up of the ensemble these are sometimes riots of colour and sound which largely set aside solos for energetic parallel interplay... These are limber, energetic and loose (but sometimes claustrophobically enjoyable) and anyone who knows Cherry's work around this period and after will find this quite thrilling."
[13]
Stef Gijssels, writing for
The Free Jazz Collective
, commented: "The music demonstrates Cherry's aspiration for a universal language through music, incorporating many ideas and rhythms, all integrated in one joyous and communal interaction."
[14]
In a review for
Aquarium Drunkard
, Tyler Wilcox wrote: "It's wild and occasionally dense stuff, but the primary feeling that comes across is childlike wonder, a joyful innocence that saturates every moment."
[15]
Jennifer Kelly, in an article for
Dusted Magazine
, praised the album's "warmth and immediacy," and noted: "there's a wonderful sense of play and cross cultural collaboration in these cuts." She asked: "How far along were other jazz musicians at this point in bringing in African and middle eastern instruments?"
[16]
In an essay for
The Quietus
, Dustin Krcatovich stated that the most radical aspect of the recording is "the insistence that the music be communal and solo-free. Don and Moki would generally demur at the notion that their work might be considered 'political', but the rejection of leaders is an inherently political act no matter how one chooses to frame it."

The
Operation Rah-e-Nijat
("Path to Salvation";
Urdu
:
آپریشن راہ نجات
) was a strategic offensive
military operation
by the
unified command
of
Pakistan Armed Forces
against the
Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan
(TTP) and their extremist allies in the
South Waziristan
area of the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas
that began on June 19, 2009;
[7]
a major ground-air offensive was subsequently launched on October 17. It became the integral part of the
war in Western fronts
which led to the
encirclement
and destruction of Taliban forces in the region, although the Taliban leadership escaped to lawless areas of neighboring
Afghanistan
.
The operation was intended to finish the senior Taliban leadership and bring the lawless areas back to government control, however the leadership escaped to Afghanistan whilst areas came back under the Pakistan government control. Planning for the operation began on June 16, 2009 after successfully commencing a previous offense, the operation
Rah-e-Ra'ast
, and had applied a successful blockade of the region that prevented the Taliban forces from gaining external support. On October 2, 2009, the preparations for the operation were made after a top civic-military meeting took place in
Islamabad
which led to the revival and starting of
Navy
's reconnaissance and surveillance air operations to monitor the troop rotations of Taliban forces. On October 19, the ground offensive was launched when military personnel from
XI Corps
, along with the airborne forces who were assisted by the joint special forces, entered the area of South Waziristan, which had been subject to a three month long blockade. The
Pakistan Air Force
pounded the hidden and suspected mountainous regions, relying on the Navy's intelligence, while the Army marched deeper into Taliban-controlled territory. The joint-military forces entered and advanced in the region from three directions—
Razmak
in the north,
Jandola
in the east and Shakai in the west. The forces advanced into the towns of Makeen (2 serious encounter in the villages of Wachooba and Bahadar khan), Leeta Sar, Mandeech, Spinkai, Raghzai and Tiarza; initially focusing on taking the town of Kotkai which served as the command and control center for enemy combatant forces. On 24 October, the breakthrough and major achievement came when the military announced that it had successfully retaken control of the town of Kotkai after heavy fighting.
On 29 October, the military occupied the town of Kaniguram, a stronghold of former Russians fighters and Uzbeks led by the
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan
. On December 12, the military announced the success of the operation and took the control of the entire South Waziristan into government control. The human cost and casualties for Taliban forces were extremely high, losing roughly a thousand fighters as compared to the military forces; the senior Taliban leadership abandoned their posts and escaped to neighboring Afghanistan before they could be apprehended or killed in the actions.
Blockade of South Waziristan
[
edit
]
On June 16, 2009, in the aftermath of the successful victory and recapture of the entire
Swat valley
, the Pakistan Army began a massive troop build-up along the southern and eastern borders of South
Waziristan
. Pakistan was now taking the fight to
Tehrik-i-Taliban
chief
Baitullah Mehsud
's mountainous stronghold, ordering an expansion of its current offensive against Taliban fighters in the Swat valley. On Sunday night, denouncing Mehsud as "the root cause of all evils," Owais Ghani, the governor of the North-West Frontier Province, said the government has called on the army to launch a "full-fledged" military operation to eliminate Mehsud and his estimated 20,000 men. The crucial battle may prove to be the most difficult that Pakistan's military has faced on its soil in recent years.
Islamabad
's decision to launch the offensive against Mehsud signals a deepening of Pakistani resolve against the militants. The army has targeted the Taliban leader on three separate occasions—in 2004, 2005 and 2008—but walked away each time after signing ruinous "peace deals" that have only served to embolden Mehsud. But the military appears more determined this time. It also enjoys the backing of the general citizenry as public support of the military has increased dramatically as the recent wave of terrorist attacks has heightened revulsion against the Taliban.
[8]
The Pakistan Armed Forces fought the war in open green plains and dry high mountains.
By June 21, 2009, at least 46 militants were killed in the South Waziristan tribal region and the Malakand division. Six soldiers, including an Army officer, were killed and 17 soldiers injured in fighting in the Malakand and South Waziristan Agency within a 24-hour period. Another six militants were apprehended, the military said. These were the first known casualties among Baitullah Mehsud's fighters in a new offensive in South Waziristan, where al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and his other top commanders and Taliban leaders were believed to be holed up.
[9]
On June 28, eight militants were killed in Swat and 10 in Waziristan, in operations that destroyed the militants' command network and led to the seizure of "a huge amount" of arms and ammunition, army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told reporters. Sixteen soldiers were killed in action, twelve of them dying near the Afghan border in the North Waziristan tribal area when their convoy was ambushed. Several vehicles were hit in the ambush and another 10 soldiers were seriously wounded.
[10]
[11]
On June 30, militants ambushed a Pakistani military convoy near the Afghan border, killing a further 12 Pakistani soldiers. Several vehicles were hit and the military said 12 soldiers were killed and 10 seriously wounded.
[11]
On July 3, a military transport helicopter of the Pakistan Army went down and crashed on the border between Khyber and Orakzai tribal region on Friday afternoon, killing all 26 soldiers on board. The helicopter crashed because of a technical fault.
[12]
[13]
On August 5, the
CIA
carried out a
drone
strike on
Baitullah Mehsud
and his family. Mehsud was killed, along with his father-in-law and his wife.
[14]
The operation in South Waziristan was already in planning process.
[15]
Two divisions of military were deployed and negotiations with the tribes and minor groups of militants were being conducted to isolate the enemy.
[15]
Second phase
[

Preparations
[
edit
]
After a three-month blockade of South Waziristan and intermittent skirmishes with militants, the Pakistani military announced on October 2, 2009, that it would begin a large-scale operation to wipe out Taliban and Al Qaeda militants in the area. Pakistani officials characterized the impending clash as "
the mother of all battles.
" Prior to the launch of the operation, the Pakistani Army had reinforced their presence on the borders of South Waziristan to two divisions (20,000-30,000 troops) who were facing a heavily entrenched force of 6,000-7,000 militants, including Taliban-allied Mehsud tribesmen as well as Uzbek and Arab foreign fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda.
[16]
During the conflict, the
JF-17
was deployed for the first time after their induction into the
Pakistan Air Force
.
A meeting, which was attended by the top civilian and military leadership, gave the go-ahead to launch a military operation in
South Waziristan
to eliminate terrorism and extremism on October 16.
[17]
Members attending included Awami National Party's
Asfandyar Wali Khan
, PML-N's
Mian Shahbaz Sharif
, Muttahida Qaumi Movement's Dr
Farooq Sattar
, Balochistan National Party-A's Senator
Israrullah Zehri
,
Aftab Ahmad Sherpao
of the Pakistan People's Party-S, Munir Khan Orakzai from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas,
Raza Rabbani
of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, Pir Sadruddin Shah of the PML-F, Maulana Mohammad Khan Sherani of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl), Defence Minister
Ahmad Mukhtar
, Finance Minister
Shaukat Tarin
, Foreign Minister
Shah Mehmood Qureshi
, Minister for Information and Broadcasting
Qamar Zaman Kaira
, NWFP Governor
Owais Ahmed Ghani
and Chief Minister
Ameer Haider Khan Hoti
, the chief of the Intelligence Bureau.
[17]
One report indicated that the offensive had a two-month timetable.
[18]
Ground offensive
[
edit
]
The
Pakistan Army
started the campaign with 28,000 infantry and Airborne troops entering South Waziristan against the
Taliban
on October 17.
[19]
Forces involved included the American trained Pakistan Army's 50th Airborne Division,
7th
and 9th Infantry Divisions of
XI Corps (Pakistan)
, which is the controlling headquarters, and 40th Infantry Division of Army Reserve Centre. (orbat.com, accessed 24 October 2009) The Pakistani Army advanced across South Waziristan from three directions—
Razmak
in the north,
Jandola
in the east and
Shakai
in the west.
[19]
The Pakistani forces were reported to be moving towards the towns of
Makeen
,
Spinkai
, Raghzai and Tiarza.
[19]
PAF
's fighter aircraft, notably
F-16
and
JF-17
, flown by the members of
SSW
's
4th SOS Squadron
, heavily bombed the area, in order to soften militant hideouts.
[20]
The invasion was timed before winter weather caused snow to block roads, but so that when winter arrived, the cold weather would force Taliban from their hideouts.
[20]
The Taliban forces, led by new leader
Hakimullah Mehsud
, are estimated to be between 10,000-20,000 along with 500-5,000
Uzbek
supporters.
[19]
In the midnight of October 17, the troops of 50th Airborne Division began to parachuted along with the members of
PN
SEALs Team 8th of
SSG(N)
, 9th Wing Company of
Army Rangers
, and the 10th Special Forces Battalion of Pakistan Army. The Pakistan army, totaling 28,000, are likely to receive support from
paramilitary
groups in tribal areas of South Waziristan.
[19]
Dozens of casualties on both sides were reported to have been inflicted as fierce fighting commenced.
[19]
Casualties are expected to increase as the military move deeper into Taliban territory.
[19]
Civilians of South Waziristan attempting to leave had difficulty as the military blocked the roads, which were used to transport arms and ammunition to troops.
[19]
People of the area are migrating to the main town of
Peshawar
.
[21]
The communication network was severely affected.
[19]
The Pakistan Air Force's SSW 4th SOS Squadron used attack helicopters and fighter jets to force the Taliban into the mountains when they put up resistance.
[22]
Up to 100,000 civilians have left the conflict area.
[23]
On October 20 it was reported that, three weeks prior, the Pakistani government had cut deals with the anti-American militants led by former Taliban commanders
Maulvi Nazir
and
Hafiz Gul Bahadur
. This deal was expected to help the operation succeed, and was not opposed by U.S. officials.
[24]
The US killed 27 people in a drone strike in
Bajaur
on October 24.
[23]
PAF F-16s were also committed to the fighting.
On October 24, Pakistani officials announced that Airborne troops, backed up by artillery, helicopters and fighter jets, had gained control of the town of
Kotkai
, a key breakthrough in the offensive.
[23]
Kotkai was home to the Taliban leader,
Hakimullah Mehsud
and it had experienced fierce fighting between both sides since the ground offensive started.
[23]
Earlier that week, Pakistani forces took control of the town briefly, but the Taliban regained it.
[23]
On October 29, news agencies were told that the Pakistan army had surrounded the town of
Kaniguram
, a stronghold of
Uzbek
fighters.
[25]
The army reported that, since the operation began on October 17, 264 Taliban militants had been killed and 33 Pakistani soldiers had been killed in action.
[25]
On November 2, the Pakistani Army took control of Kaniguram, a key Taliban regional stronghold and a stronghold of Uzbek militants, led by the hardline
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan
.
[26]
By November 17, the Pakistani Army took control of most of the towns in South Waziristan such as Sararogha.
[27]
Airborne paratroopers were parachuted from C-130s during the conflict.
By December 12, the operation was over and the Army retook the whole of South Waziristan. However, none of the top Taliban leaders were killed or captured in the operation. The government's next aim was the Orakzai region where most of the Taliban forces retreated.
[28]
594 Taliban militants and 80 Pakistani soldiers were killed during the ground offensive. Another 243 soldiers were wounded and 83 militants were captured.
[3]
[4]
[5]
In clashes in Makeen on July 10, 2010, twenty-five Taliban and three Pakistani soldiers were killed.
[29]
Refugees
[
edit
]
According to the official
Inter-Services Public Relations
(ISPR) press release, dated October 20, 2009, 11,080 families (80,000 individuals) were registered to be
internally displaced
from South Waziristan to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in
Tank District
and
Dera Ismail Khan District
before the start of the operation on October 17, while a total of 4,477 families (41,289 individuals) were registered after the military onslaught.
[30]
Peace prospects
[
edit
]
The rationale of Operation Rah-e-Nijat has been criticized by many intellectuals, however, this was among the options available for Pakistan. It is hoped from the claims of Army that soon militant basis will be uprooted and peace will be restored. Peace prospects depend on several factors. Among which, regional approach is sine qua non to eliminate terrorists as Pakistan claims no monopoly over the industry of terror.
[31]
Terrorist elements are not confined to Pakistan alone, and are allegedly active in the entire region.

Henry IV
(German:
Heinrich IV
; 11 November 1050 - 7 August 1106) was
Holy Roman Emperor
from 1084 to 1105,
King of Germany
from 1054 to 1105,
King of Italy
and
Burgundy
from 1056 to 1105, and
Duke of Bavaria
from 1052 to 1054. He was the son of
Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor
—the second monarch of the
Salian dynasty
—and
Agnes of Poitou
. After his father's death on 5 October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the
"liberty of the Church"
strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop
Anno II of Cologne
kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.
Henry endeavoured to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in
Saxony
and
Thuringia
. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat
Otto of Nordheim
in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high office offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogative to appoint bishops and abbots, although the
reformist clerics
condemned this practice as
simony
(a forbidden sale of church offices).
Pope Alexander II
blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the
Holy See
and the German dukes weakened his position and the
Saxons rose up in open rebellion
in the summer of 1074. Taking advantage of a quarrel between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry, he forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.
Henry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander II's successor,
Gregory VII
, who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24 January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as
Canossa
to meet with the Pope. His penitential "
Walk to Canossa
" was a success and Gregory VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an
antiking
,
Rudolf of Rheinfelden
, on 14 March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7 March 1080. Most German and northern Italian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope
Clement III
. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor,
Hermann of Salm
, could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1 April 1084.
Hermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally,
Matilda of Tuscany
, in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son,
Conrad II
, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with
Welf I, Duke of Bavaria
, prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but did not make peace with
Pope Paschal II
. Henry proclaimed the first
Reichsfriede
(imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son,
Henry V
, forced him to abdicate on 31 December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's preeminent role in the
Investiture Controversy
, his "Walk to Canossa" and his conflicts with his sons and wives established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, and others describing him as an exemplary monarch who protected the poor.
Background
[
edit
]
Henry was the third monarch of the
Salian dynasty
—the royal house ruling
Germany
from 1024 to 1125.
[1]
The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled
Italy
and
Burgundy
and had a strong claim to the title of Holy Roman Emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them each to act as the head of all Christians and to control papal elections in Rome.
[2]
Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the
Tusculani
and the
Crescentii
, who raised their own candidates to the papal throne.
[3]
Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating in three rival popes—
Benedict IX
,
Sylvester III
and
Gregory VI
—in 1045.
[4]
[5]
To put an end to the schism, Henry's father,
Henry III
, crossed the
Alps
to Italy and held a
church synod at Sutri
on 20 December 1046.
[1]
The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name
Clement II
.
[6]
Henry III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' anointment by holy oil.
[7]
A man of great personal piety, he regarded himself as "
Vicar of Christ
", authorized to administer state and church alike.
[8]
The Romans awarded him the hereditary title of
patrician
, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.
[9]
His new title enabled him to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.
[10]
The third German pope,
Leo IX
, came from
Lotharingia
—a province that had been an important centre of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of
canon law
and Leo IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas to Rome. He prohibited simony—the sale of church offices—and promoted
clerical celibacy
.
[11]
Imperial control of church affairs was in the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of "liberty of the Church" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the
Investiture Controversy
.
[12]
Germany, Italy and Burgundy were composed of semi-independent provinces, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat.
[13]
The prelates—the bishops and abbots—were not only wealthy landowners, they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.
[14]
The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice.
[15]
The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice but to fill vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.
[16]
Henry III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life.
Godfrey the Bearded
,
Duke of Upper Lotharingia
, married a wealthy widow, Margravine
Beatrice of Tuscany
, without the Emperor's consent. Henry III also outraged the Saxon duke,
Bernard II
, because he supported the duke's main rival, Archbishop
Adalbert of Hamburg
, in the seizure of some Saxon counties.
[17]
The Salian kings who inherited their
Ottonian
predecessors' domains in Saxony visited the province frequently. Their lengthy visits irritated the Saxon aristocrats who were exposed to direct royal control for more time than their peers in other parts of the empire. The Saxons' grievances against the Salian monarchs broke out in a series of revolts during Henry IV's reign.
[18]
The empire's neighbours caused no less concern. Henry III launched punitive expeditions against
Bohemia
to extort an oath of fealty from the rebellious Duke
Bretislav I
. King
Peter of Hungary
, who owed his throne to Henry, also swore fealty to him, but was dethroned in 1046. Henry invaded Hungary, but could not force Peter's successor, King
Andrew I
, into submission.
[19]
[20]
Andrew designated his brother,
Béla
, as his heir. Conflicts between Andrew and Béla, and later between their sons, culminated during the first decades of Henry IV's reign, provoking German military campaigns against Hungary.
[21]
Henry III asserted his authority over the southern Italian princes, including the
Norman
counts of Aversa
and
Apulia
in 1047.
[22]
The absent emperor, however, could not control the Norman adventurers and he chose to charge the popes with the representation of his interests in southern Italy.
[23]
Early life
[
edit
]
Born on 11 November 1050, Henry was the son of the
Holy Roman Emperor
, Henry III, by his second wife,
Agnes of Poitou
.
[24]
Henry was most likely born in his father's
palace at Goslar
.
[25]
His birth had been long-awaited; Henry III had fathered four daughters, but his subjects were convinced only a male heir could secure the "peace of kingdom" (as
Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne
, called it in a sermon).
[25]
[26]
Henry was first named for his grandfather,
Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor
, but Abbot
Hugh of Cluny
, whom Henry III had appointed as his son's
godfather
, convinced the Emperor to give his name to his heir.
[26]
While celebrating Christmas 1050 at
Pöhlde
in Saxony, the ailing Henry III designated his infant son as his successor.
[26]
[27]
Archbishop Hermann baptised Henry in
Cologne
on Easter Sunday 1051.
[25]
In November, the Emperor held an assembly at
Tribur
to secure his son's succession.
[28]
The German princes who attended the meeting elected the one-year-old king. They stipulated they would acknowledge him as his father's successor only if he acted as a "just ruler" during his father's lifetime.
[28]
Historian Ian S. Robinson supposes the princes actually wanted to persuade Henry III to change his methods of government since the child king had no role in state administration.
[29]
At Christmas 1052, the Emperor made Henry the duke of
Bavaria
.
[26]
[29]
Archbishop Hermann crowned Henry King of Germany in
Aachen
on 17 July 1054.
[29]
[30]
On this occasion, Henry's two-year-old younger brother,
Conrad
, most likely received Bavaria from their father.
[29]
When Conrad died in 1055, the Emperor gave Bavaria to Empress Agnes.
[31]
The Emperor betrothed Henry to
Bertha of Savoy
in late 1055.
[32]
Her parents,
Adelaide, Margravine of Turin
, and
Otto, Count of Savoy
, controlled north-western Italy. The Emperor wanted to secure their alliance against the rebellious Godfrey the Bearded.
[32]
Henry III fell seriously ill after eating a stag's liver in late September 1056.
[32]
Historian Herbert Schutz attributes his sudden illness to his exhaustion.
[33]
Already dying, the Emperor commended his son to the protection of
Pope Victor II
who had come from Italy to Germany to seek the Emperor's protection against the Norman rulers of southern Italy.
[34]
[35]
Henry III died on 5 October 1056.
[36]
Reign as king
[
edit
]
Under guardianship
[
edit
]
Throne of Charlemagne
in the
Palatine Chapel
in Aachen
At the age of six, Henry became sole monarch of the empire.
[34]
[36]
Pope Victor II convinced the German aristocrats to swear fealty to their young king and enthroned him in Aachen.
[36]
Although Empress Agnes had been planning to enter a
nunnery
, she was appointed her son's
guardian
.
[34]
She was responsible for her son's education along with a royal
ministerialis
(unfree
liegeman
), Cuno.
[37]
She secured the most powerful aristocrats' support through lavish grants.
[38]
Agnes was reconciled with Godfrey the Bearded and made her late husband's other opponent,
Conrad
of the
Ezzonid
family,
duke of Carinthia
.
[39]
Agnes took full control of state administration as
regent
after Pope Victor II left Germany early in 1057,
[40]
but she paid little attention to Burgundy and Italy.
[41]
Henry had inherited his father's Roman title of patrician, but the concept of "liberty of the Church" became dominant in Rome during his minority.
[42]
Pope Victor's successor,
Stephen IX
—Godfrey the Bearded's brother—was elected without royal intervention early in August.
[43]
A group of Saxon aristocrats plotted against Henry, fearing he would continue his father's oppressive policies after reaching the age of majority. They convinced
Otto of Nordmark
, who had recently returned from exile, to mount a coup. Henry's two relatives,
Bruno II
and
Egbert I of Brunswick
, attacked the conspirators. Bruno killed Otto but was mortally wounded in the skirmish.
[44]
In 1057, Agnes appointed a wealthy aristocrat, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, to be
Duke of Swabia
and also charged him with the administration of Burgundy.
[38]
[45]
[46]
Godfrey the Bearded took possession of
Spoleto
and
Fermo
, probably through a royal grant.
[47]
Rumours of Godfrey's determination to seize the imperial crown with Pope Stephen's help spread in Italy, but the Pope died unexpectedly on 29 March 1058.
[48]
The Roman aristocrats placed one of their number,
Giovanni, Cardinal Bishop of Velletri
, on the papal throne without consulting with Henry's representatives. Giovanni took the name Benedict X, but
Peter Damian
, the
Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia
, refused to consecrate him, although the consecration of a new pope had been the Ostian bishops' traditional privilege. The cardinals assembled at Florence where Pope Stephen had died to discuss Pope Stephen's succession. They wanted to elect the local bishop
Gerard
pope and sent an envoy to Germany to inform Henry about their plan.
[49]
[42]
Henry, "having deliberated with the princes", designated Gerard as the Pope in
Augsburg
on 7 June.
[43]
King Andrew I of Hungary also sent delegates to Germany in September 1058.
[50]
Andrew wanted to secure his five-year-old son
Solomon
's succession, ignoring his brother's claim to succeed him.
[50]
The Hungarian envoys and Henry's representatives concluded a treaty, and Henry's sister,
Judith
, was engaged to Solomon.
[43]
[50]
The reformist clerics elected Bishop Gerard pope in Florence in December 1058.
[43]
He took the name Nicholas II.
[43]
[51]
Godfrey the Bearded accompanied him to Rome and forced Antipope Benedict to leave the city.
[52]
His advisor, the monk
Hildebrand
, was determined to strengthen the autonomy of the papacy.
[53]
[54]
The Pope held a
synod
which issued a decree,
In nomine Domini
, establishing the
cardinals
' right to elect the popes as against
election by people and clergy
, which had been manipulated by Henry III.
[55]
[56]
Referring to Henry IV as "presently king and with the help of God emperor-to-be", the decree also confirmed the emperors' existing prerogatives over papal elections, but without specifying them.
[57]
[58]
As early as 1057-1058, however, Cardinal
Humbert of Silva Candida
questioned the monarchs' right to invest clerics with bishoprics and abbeys in his treatises against simony.
[59]
[60]
[61]
Pope Nicholas invested two Norman rulers,
Robert Guiscard
and
Richard I of Capua
, with southern Italian duchies in 1059. In return, the Normans swore fealty to the Pope and promised to support him against his enemies, probably the Roman aristocrats. Although the duchies were imperial fiefs, Nicholas's action did not necessarily trespass on imperial rights, because the popes had acted as the emperors' representatives in southern Italy for a decade. However, the Pope's
treaty with the Normans
forged their lasting alliance.
[62]
[23]
Henry jumps from Archbishop
Anno II
of Cologne's ship into the Rhine at Kaiserswerth in 1062 (
engraving
by
Bernhard Rode
, 1781).
Andrew I of Hungary faced a rebellion from his brother, Duke Béla, in 1060.
[63]
Agnes dispatched Bavarian, Saxon and Bohemian troops to Hungary to fight Béla and his Polish allies, but the three armies did not coordinate their movements.
[63]
Béla defeated his brother who died of his wounds.
[50]
[63]
Andrew's family fled to Germany, and Béla was crowned king on 6 December.
[50]
[63]
After Béla's victory, the command of the German duchies along the Hungarian frontier had to be strengthened.
[63]
Agnes ceded Bavaria to a wealthy Saxon lord, Otto of Nordheim, and replaced Duke Conrad of Carinthia with
Berthold of Zähringen
in early 1061.
[64]
Relations between Pope Nicholas and the German prelates became tense for unknown reasons in 1061.
[65]
[66]
When Nicholas died on 20 July 1061, the Roman aristocrats dispatched an embassy to Henry asking him to nominate a new pope.
[67]
Hildebrand and other reformist clerics elected Anselm of Baggio, Bishop of Lucca, pope on 30 September without Henry's confirmation.
[66]
[68]
[69]
Anselm took the name
Pope Alexander II
.
[51]
[69]
Henry summoned the Italian bishops to a synod in
Basel
to discuss the situation.
[51]
[70]
He attended the synod, wearing the insignia of his office of patrician of the Romans.
[70]
The synod elected
Cadalus, Bishop of Parma
,
antipope
on 28 October.
[70]
The election of two popes divided the German clergy. Some bishops supported Cadalus (now known as Honorius II) and others accepted Alexander II.
[69]
Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg was Honorius's most prominent supporter, while Archbishop
Anno II of Cologne
acknowledged Alexander as the lawful pope.
[69]
Empress Agnes supported Honorius, for which her advisors were excommunicated by Alexander.
[71]
Her blatant favouritism for Bishop
Henry II of Augsburg
and the complete failure of the Hungarian campaign had compromised her prestige; the schism raised more indignation.
[72]
[73]
Archbishop Anno, Egbert of Brunswick, Otto of Nordheim and other discontented aristocrats decided to deprive her of the regency.
[74]
Archbishop Anno equipped a ship "with admirable workmanship" and sailed down the
Rhine
to an island near the royal palace at
Kaiserswerth
in April 1062.
[72]
[75]
The ship fascinated Henry, so Anno could easily talk him into a visit on it.
[72]
As soon as Henry stepped on board, the ship was cast off.
[72]
Fearing his captors wanted to murder him, Henry jumped into the river.
[72]
[73]
He almost drowned, but Egbert of Brunswick rescued him.
[72]
The "
Coup of Kaiserswerth
" destroyed the Empress's self-confidence, and she retired to her estates.
[75]
[76]
Anno replaced her as the head of the government.
[75]
His new title of
magister
(master) shows that he also took charge of Henry's education.
[77]
Anno was determined to put an end to the schism.
[37]
In October 1062, the synod of the German bishops appointed his nephew,
Burchard II, Bishop of Halberstadt
, to begin negotiations with Pope Alexander II.
[78]
That same month, the theologian Peter Damian completed a
treatise
defending the legality of Alexander II's election.
[58]
He emphasised that Henry's "right to participate in the papal elections ... is subject each time to reconfirmation by the pope".
[58]
Damian's argument implied that Henry only inherited a claim to the imperial prerogatives relating to papal elections, but he could forfeit it.
[58]
Respect for the monarch also declined in Germany.
[79]
For example, the retainers of Abbot
Widerad of Fulda
and Bishop
Hezilo of Hildesheim
ignored Henry's commands when an
armed conflict broke out between them
in his presence at a church in Goslar in June 1063.
[79]
[80]
Béla I of Hungary wanted to make peace with Henry to secure his throne against his nephew, Solomon, who had taken refuge in Germany.
[81]
Henry and his advisors, however, insisted on Solomon's restoration to the Hungarian throne and German troops
invaded Hungary
in August 1063.
[81]
[82]
Henry gained his first military experience during this campaign.
[81]
[82]
Béla died in an accident unexpectedly and the German army entered
Székesfehérvár
.
[82]
Henry installed Solomon on the throne and attended his wedding to Judith before returning to Germany.
[81]
[83]
Adalbert of Bremen accompanied Henry on the Hungarian campaign and struck up a friendship with him.
[81]
Adalbert was mentioned as Henry's "protector" in royal diplomas from 1063, indicating a position equal to Anno's.
[81]
Anno went to Italy to recognise Alexander II as pope at a synod in
Mantua
in May 1064, and in his absence Adalbert was able to strengthen his influence with Henry.

's presentation as part of the Holy Roman Empire is debated.
Henry was girded with a sword as a token of his coming of age in
Worms
on 29 March 1065.
[85]
According to the contemporaneous account of
Lampert of Hersfeld
, Henry attacked Archbishop Anno of Cologne soon after the ceremony and only his mother could calm him down.
[86]
Lampert's report is not fully reliable, but it is known that Anno was ousted from Henry's court.
[87]
At Worms, Henry accepted Pope Alexander II's invitation to Rome.
[88]
Agnes of Poitou recovered her influence, but she left Germany for Italy two months later and Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen took full control of state administration.
[89]
Henry's journey to Rome was postponed first until autumn, and then indefinitely, although the Pope needed Henry's presence to overcome the Italian supporters of Antipope Honorius II.
[38]
[90]
Instead of travelling to Rome, Henry visited Burgundy in June 1065. Burgundian diplomas show the local aristocrats regarded his visit as the starting date of his reign. From Burgundy, Henry went to Lorraine where he granted Lower Lorraine to Godfrey the Bearded in October.
[91]
[92]
Adalbert of Bremen, in concert with the King's young friend, Werner, abused royal prerogative to seize church property and took bribes for royal appointments. They persuaded the King to grant monasteries to the most powerful prelates and princes to appease their envy at their aggrandizement.
[93]
Adalbert's attempts to take possession of
Lorsch Abbey
by force caused his fall, because the scandal enabled Archbishops
Siegfried of Mainz
and Anno of Cologne to stage a plot.
[94]
They secured the support of Otto of Nordheim, Rudolf of Rheinfelden and Berthold of Zähringen and convinced Henry to dismiss Adalbert on 13 January 1066.
[38]
[95]
Anno regained the King's favour, but thereafter no royal advisors could take full control of state administration.
[96]
[97]
Henry fell unexpectedly ill in the middle of May 1066. His sickness was so serious that he was thought to be dying. The aristocrats began to seek his successor, but he recovered in two weeks. He immediately married his betrothed, Bertha, most probably because the uncertainty about the childless monarch's succession caused widespread anxiety in his realms.
[98]
[99]
Late in 1066, Prince Richard I of Capua rose up against Pope Alexander II and invaded
Roman Campagna
.
[100]
Early in 1067, Agnes of Poitou hurried back from Rome to Germany to persuade her son to intervene on the Pope's behalf. Henry ordered his troops to assemble at Augsburg, but Godfrey the Bearded was faster and launched a successful counter-offensive against Richard in June. Godfrey's independent act was regarded as an insult to Henry's authority in Italy.
[51]
[101]
Adalbert of Bremen's fall had encouraged the
Lutici
(a pagan Slavic tribe dwelling over the river
Elbe
) to invade Germany and plunder
Hamburg
. In early 1069, Henry crossed the Elbe to punish the invaders. He defeated them, but could not prevent them from launching subsequent plundering raids against Saxony.
[102]
[103]
Saxon rebellion and Investiture Controversy
[
edit
]
Further information:
Saxon revolt of 1073-1075
and
Investiture Controversy
Large parcels of the royal
demesne
were distributed during Henry's minority, and he decided to recover them around 1069.
[104]
The bulk of the royal estates had been in Saxony.
[104]
Henry sent
Swabian
ministeriales
to the duchy to investigate property rights. The appointment of non-native unfree officials offended the Saxons, especially because the new officials ignored their traditional
civil procedures
.
[104]
[105]
New castles were built in Saxony and Henry manned them with Swabian soldiers.
[104]
[106]
Like his father, Henry spent more time in Saxony than in other parts of Germany and the accommodation of his retinue was the Saxons' irksome duty.
[107]
The Thuringians were also outraged that Henry supported Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz's claim to collect tithes from them, although most Thuringians had been exempted from the church tax for centuries.
[108]
The
Margrave of Lower Lusatia
,
Dedi I
, was the first Saxon lord to rebel.
[108]
He claimed
benefices
that
his wife
's former husband,
Otto I, Margrave of Meissen
, had held, but Henry refused him in 1069.
[108]
[109]
Dedi approached the Thuringians for help, but after Henry's promise to confirm their exemption from tithes the Thuringians joined the royal army. Henry invaded Dedi's domains and forced him to surrender.
[108]
Otto of Nordheim held vast estates in Saxony.
[104]
After a nobleman, Egeno, accused him of plotting against Henry's life, Otto was summoned to "purge himself of that charge in single combat" early in August 1070. The contemporary historian
Bruno the Saxon
stated that Henry had paid Egeno to accuse Otto, but his account is biased.
[110]
Fearing his case would not be judged fairly, Otto disobeyed the summons and fled from Bavaria to Saxony.
[104]
[111]
He was soon outlawed and his benefices were confiscated.
[110]
Henry invaded Otto's Saxon domains, but Otto raided the royal estates in Thuringia.
[110]
Ordulf, Duke of Saxony
, and most Saxon aristocrats remained loyal to Henry, but Ordulf's son and heir,
Magnus
, joined Otto's revolt.
[112]
Henry ceded Bavaria to Otto's wealthy son-in-law, Welf, at Christmas 1070.
[109]
[113]
Without their peers' support, Otto and Magnus had to surrender. Henry placed them in the German dukes' and bishops' custody on 12 June 1071.
[114]
Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen convinced Henry to release Otto of Nordheim in May 1072, but Magnus of Saxony remained imprisoned.
[104]
[115]
Before long, Adalbert died and Henry seized his treasury—an early example of the application of the
jus spolii
by a German monarch.
[116]
Henry started appointing low-ranking men to royal offices in the whole kingdom and this practice outraged the German aristocrats. Rudolf of Rheinfelden and Berthold of Zähringen returned to their duchies from the royal court and rumours accusing them of plotting against the King spread in Germany.
[117]
Rudolf appealed to Agnes of Poitou, asking her to reconcile him with her son.
[118]
Agnes, who had moved to Rome in 1065, returned to Germany and mediated a reconciliation in July 1072. It proved temporary because Henry did not dismiss his advisors.
[119]
Agnes shared the dukes' negative views of Henry's advisors and persuaded Pope Alexander to excommunicate at least five of them in February 1073,
[120]
[121]
though Henry did not sever ties with them.
[122]
Henry's brother-in-law, King Solomon of Hungary, appeals to Henry for help (
miniature
in the 14th-century
Vienna Illuminated Chronicle
).
Appointments to the highest church offices remained crucial elements of Henry's authority: the practice enabled him to demand benefices for his supporters from the wealthy bishops and abbots, but the reformist clergy condemned it as simony.
[123]
When Henry appointed a Milanese nobleman,
Gotofredo
, to the
Archbishopric of Milan
in 1070, Pope Alexander II excommunicated the new archbishop. Henry obtained Gotofredo's consecration, however, which brought him into a prolonged conflict with the Holy See.
[124]
[125]
[126]
The
Bishopric of Constance
became another source of conflict in 1070 after the local clerics appealed to the Holy See to prevent the installation of Henry's candidate, Charles of Magdeburg, to the episcopal see.
[127]
Henry denied Charles had bribed him, but he publicly admitted at a synod that his advisors may have received money from Charles.
[127]
Pope Alexander II decided to investigate and summoned all German bishops who had been accused of simony or corruption to Rome, but he died in two months.
[123]
The Romans proclaimed Hildebrand as his successor on 22 April 1073.
[120]
[121]
Hildebrand, who assumed the name Gregory VII, did not seek confirmation from Henry.
[125]
[120]
He did not challenge Henry's prerogatives, but he was convinced a monarch who had regular contacts with excommunicated people could not intervene in church affairs.
[120]
[122]
He regarded lay investiture as the principal barrier to completing the reform of the Church and challenged royal appointments, taking advantage of individual complaints against German prelates.
[128]
Henry's Italian chancellor,
Bishop Gregory of Vercelli
, and an assembly of the German bishops, urged the King to declare Gregory's election invalid, because he had been proclaimed pope by the Romans instead of being elected by the cardinals. The German dukes and Godfrey the Bearded's influential widow, Beatrice of Tuscany, convinced Henry that he should cooperate with the Pope.
[129]
Bolesław II
,
Duke of Poland
, invaded Bohemia in early 1073, and Henry decided to launch a punitive action against him.
[115]
He ordered the Saxon aristocrats to assemble at Goslar, where on 29 June they asked Henry to redress their grievances. Henry made no concessions and withdrew from Goslar to
Harzburg
.
[130]
[18]
Otto of Nordheim soon convinced the assembled Saxons to take up arms for their liberties.
[105]
[131]
The Saxons marched to Harzburg, but Henry had fled to Eschwege.
[131]
The Thuringians and the Saxons concluded an alliance and captured
Lüneburg
.
[132]
To save the life of the commander of Lüneburg, Henry released Magnus of Saxony, whom the rebels acknowledged as their lawful duke without seeking royal confirmation.
[133]
The German dukes and bishops did not come to Henry's rescue, and the rebels began attacking the royal castles.
[134]
To prevent the rebellious Saxon bishops from securing the Pope's support, Henry addressed a letter of penance to the Pope, admitting he had been involved in simony.
[135]
He claimed his youthful arrogance had been responsible for his sins and blamed his advisors for his acts.
[136]
Siegfried of Mainz, Anno of Cologne, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Berthold of Zähringen and other German aristocrats came to
Gerstungen
to begin negotiations with the Saxon leaders in October 1073.
[134]
They tried to persuade Henry to redress the Saxons' grievances, but he was determined to crush the revolt.
[134]
A month later, Henry's servant Regenger informed Rudolf and Berthold that Henry was planning to murder them.
[137]
Regenger was ready to prove his words in a judicial duel, but he died unexpectedly in January 1074. His statements, however, deepened the conflict between the King and the two dukes.
[137]
Henry, who had just recovered from an illness, moved to Worms.
[137]
The local bishop,
Adalbert
, denied his entry, but the townspeople rose up against the bishop and surrendered Worms to Henry.
[137]
[138]
A grateful Henry exempted the burghers from customs duties, emphasising their loyalty in a time when "all the princes of the realm were raging" against him.
[139]
Liemar
, Archbishop of Bremen,
Udo
, Archbishop of Trier, and eight bishops came to visit Henry in Worms in early 1074.
[137]
Their retainers and the Worms militia joined Henry in a new military campaign against the Saxons and Thuringians, but he soon realised the rebels outnumbered his army and entered into negotiations with them.
[140]
Henry accepted the rebels' principal demands in the
Treaty of Gerstungen
on 2 February.
[140]
He agreed to destroy his castles and appoint only natives to offices in Saxony in return for the Saxon aristocrats' promise to raze their newly built fortresses.
[141]
[142]
On hearing the agreement, the Saxon peasants captured and destroyed Harzburg and
desecrated
the graves of Henry's younger brother and first-born son.
[141]
[143]
The destruction of the royal graves aroused public indignation, and Henry regarded it as a violation of the treaty.
[109]
[144]
Ruins of Homburg Castle. Henry's army inflicted a decisive defeat on the Saxons near the castle in 1074.
Pope Gregory appointed the cardinal bishops
Gerald of Ostia
and
Hubert of Palestrina
to begin negotiations with Henry.
[145]
Agnes of Poitou accompanied the two legates to her son's court.
[145]
After Henry had done a public penance for simony, the legates absolved him on 27 April 1074.
[146]
They summoned the German bishops to a synod to hear the case of Bishop
Herman I of Bamberg
who had been accused of simony, but eight prelates did not obey their summons. In response, the Pope suspended Archbishop Liemar from office, and summoned the disobedient bishops to Rome.
[146]
Henry did not intervene in the conflict, although the German prelates under investigation were his staunch supporters.
[136]
Henry's brother-in-law, Solomon of Hungary, sent envoys to Henry seeking his assistance against his cousin
Géza
(who was Béla I's eldest son).
[147]
Géza had defeated Solomon on 14 March 1074, forcing him to take refuge in the fortresses of Moson and Pressburg (now
Mosonmagyaróvár
in Hungary and
Bratislava
in Slovakia, respectively).
[148]
Solomon promised to cede six castles to Henry and acknowledge his
suzerainty
in return for Henry's support to recover his country.
[148]
[149]
Henry invaded Hungary and marched as far as
Vác
, but he could not force Géza to surrender.
[150]
Pope Gregory sharply criticised Solomon for his willingness to accept Henry's suzerainty, because the Pope regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See.
[151]
On 7 December 1074, Pope Gregory asked Henry to compel the German prelates who had not obeyed his summons to attend a synod in Rome.
[152]
The Pope suspended five German bishops for disobedience at the synod of Lent in Rome in February 1075. He blamed Henry's five advisors, likely those who had been excommunicated by his predecessor, for the conflict over the archbishopric of Milan. Henry and the German bishops wanted to avoid a conflict. Archbishops Siegfied of Mainz and Liemar of Bremen travelled to Rome to begin negotiations with the Pope. They did not protest when the Pope deposed Bishop Herman of Bamberg. The Pope appreciated their obedience and appointed Siegfried to hold a reforming synod in Germany.
[153]
Henry had meanwhile made preparations to take vengeance for the desecration of the royal graves at Harzburg. He promised amnesty and gifts to those who joined his campaign against Saxony.
[109]
Most German dukes and many bishops hurried to
Breitungen
where the royal troops were assembling in June 1074.
[154]
Saxon nobles and prelates also deserted to the royal camp.
[154]
Under the command of Rudolf of Rheinfelden, the royal army launched a surprise attack on the Saxons at
Homburg Castle
on 9 June.
[155]
Most Saxon noblemen were able to flee from the battlefield, but many of the common foot soldiers were slaughtered.
[156]
Those who survived the massacre condemned the noblemen for their comrades' fate, and their stories turned the Saxon peasantry against their lords.
[156]
Pope Gregory VII congratulated Henry on his victory, stating that the Saxons' defeat at Homburg was an act of "
divine judgement
".
[157]
Henry invaded Saxony again in autumn 1075.
[158]
Godfrey the Hunchback
,
Duke of Lower Lorraine
, was the sole German duke to join his campaign, but the Saxons were unable to resist.
[158]
Otto of Nordheim convinced them to surrender unconditionally
[141]
to the King on 26 or 27 October.
[158]
Henry pardoned Otto and returned all his benefices except Bavaria.
[120]
He showed no mercy to other rebel leaders,
[159]
who were imprisoned and had their estates confiscated.
[160]
Henry summoned the German dukes to Goslar to swear fealty to his two-year-old son, Conrad, as his successor, but only Duke
Vratislaus II of Bohemia
obeyed his command.

Road to Canossa
Henry begging Matilda of Tuscany and Hugh of Cluny in Canossa Castle (miniature in an
illuminated manuscript
kept in the
Vatican Library
, 1115)
Henry knew that his dependence on Pope Gregory VII was loosened after his victory in the Saxon War.
[157]
[162]
He sent Count Eberhard the Bearded as his deputy to Italy.
[163]
Eberhard demanded an oath of fealty from the Pope's vassal,
Robert Guiscard
,
Duke of Apulia and Calabria
.
[163]
[164]
Henry made one of his chaplains,
Tedald
, archbishop of Milan, thereby contradicting the Pope's former decisions.
[165]
Alarmed by these acts, the Pope announced he would excommunicate Henry unless he changed his policies.
[166]
Henry regarded the Pope's words as a clear denial of the sacred nature of kingship.
[167]
He held a
synod in Worms
on 24 January 1076.
[168]
Two archbishops, twenty-four German bishops (two-thirds of the German episcopate), one Burgundian bishop, an Italian bishop and Godfrey the Hunchback attended it.
[169]
At Henry's order, they declared the Pope's election invalid and demanded his abdication.
[168]
[170]
An assembly of the Lombard bishops and aristocrats passed a similar resolution in
Piacenza
on 5 February.
[171]
[172]
Henry's most important ally, Godfrey the Hunchback, was murdered on 22 February.
[172]
Godfrey had named his nephew,
Godfrey of Bouillon
, as his heir, but Henry granted Lower Lorraine to his own son, Conrad.
[173]
Pope Gregory VII was informed of the decisions of the two assemblies during the synod of Lent in Rome.
[168]
He excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from fealty in a public prayer addressed to
Saint Peter
.
[168]
[171]
The deposition of a monarch by a pope was unprecedented, but the Pope was convinced Henry's extraordinary arrogance could not be punished otherwise.
[174]
On learning of the Pope's decision Henry convoked a synod in Utrecht, but the local bishop,
William I
, was the only prelate willing to excommunicate the Pope.
[175]
Henry wanted to demonstrate that the Pope's denial of the monarchs' role in the administration of the Christian community was responsible for their conflict.
[176]
His chaplain, Gottschalk, completed a letter to be circulated in Germany, which emphasised that only God could judge a monarch.
[177]
The letter addressed the Pope as the "false monk, Hildebrand" and ended with the dramatic warning demanding his abdication: "descend, descend!"
[171]
Two incidents occurred in succession which discouraged Henry's supporters: a fire after a
lightning
strike destroyed the cathedral of Utrecht on 27 March, and Bishop William's sudden death on 27 April.
[177]
Henry's opponents regarded these incidents as
divine retribution
for his sinful acts.
[162]
[177]
Bishop
Herman of Metz
released the Saxon rebels who had been in his custody.
[178]
Bishop Burchard of Halberstadt, who had been one of the leaders of the Saxon revolt, escaped from captivity and returned to Saxony.
[178]
Theoderic and William, members of the
House of Wettin
, also returned from exile and rose up against Henry.
[178]
Henry invaded Saxony in August, but only Vratislaus II of Bohemia accompanied him.
[179]
Their arrival provoked a general uprising, and Henry was forced to flee to Bohemia.
[179]
The German aristocrats and prelates met at Trebur from 16 October to 1 November.
[179]
They convinced Henry to accept the terms the Pope had set for him.
[180]
He had to promise to dismiss his excommunicated advisors and acknowledge Gregory as the lawful pope. Furthermore, he was to acknowledge the Pope's jurisdiction in his conflicts with the German dukes and bishops.
[180]
They announced they would elect a new king if Henry was unable to achieve his absolution before the anniversary of his excommunication.
[181]
[182]
They also invited Pope Gregory to Germany to hold an assembly in Augsburg on 2 February 1077.
[182]
A depiction by
Foxe's Book of Martyrs
of Henry, inaccurately with his family, barefoot before
Pope Gregory VII
at
Canossa Castle
.
Henry moved to
Speyer
and lived there as a penitent.
[183]
[184]
He decided to depart for Italy to achieve his absolution, because he wanted to prevent the Pope from hearing his case at an assembly dominated by his enemies.
[183]
Although the winter was unexpectedly severe, Henry, his wife and their retainers crossed the
Mont Cenis
pass in December.
[185]
On 25 January, they reached
Canossa Castle
where the Pope had sought refuge, fearing that Henry came to Italy to capture him.
[186]
Henry remained barefoot and wearing sackcloth at the castle for three days.
[186]
Matilda of Tuscany
(who held the castle), Adelaide of Turin and Hugh of Cluny convinced the Pope he had no choice but to absolve the remorseful King.
[186]
[187]
Before receiving absolution, Henry had to pledge to accept the Pope's judgement in his conflict with his subjects.
[188]

Saxon revolt of 1077-1088
Henry remained in Italy after his absolution,
[189]
which surprised his German opponents. They held an assembly at
Forchheim
, arguing that it had not restored their oaths of fealty.
[190]
The bishops, archbishops, dukes and the Saxons' representatives who attended the assembly elected
Rudolf of Rheinfelden
king on 14 March 1077.
[191]
[192]
Although the papal legates who were present acknowledged Rudolf's election, Pope Gregory VII remained neutral.
[193]
He maintained he was entitled to settle the dispute and informed both Henry and Rudolf he would hear their case at an assembly in Germany.
[193]
On hearing of the election of an anti-king, Henry replaced Rudolf's principal ally,
Berthold of Zähringen
, with
Liutold of Eppenstein
as duke of Carinthia and awarded
Friuli
to
Sigehard, Patriarch of Aquilea
.
[194]
He confiscated Swabia from Rudolf and Bavaria from Welf, placing both duchies under his direct control.
[195]
Before returning to Germany in April, Henry made his three-year-old son, Conrad, his lieutenant in Italy. He charged two excommunicated Italian prelates, Tedald of Milan and Denis of Piacenza, with Conrad's protection.
[194]
Unable to prevent Henry's return, Rudolf of Rheinfelden moved to Saxony.
[196]
Henry visited Ulm, Worms, Nuremberg, Mainz,
Strasbourg
, Utrecht and Augsburg to demonstrate the full restoration of his royal authority.
[197]
He rewarded his supporters with estates confiscated from his opponents,
[198]
but the grantees had to obtain actual possession by force.
[199]
Henry and Rudolf's armies approached each other for the first time near
Würzburg
in August, but Henry avoided battle as his forces were outnumbered.
[200]
Both camps' aristocrats wanted to restore peace and agreed to hold a joint assembly in the absence of the kings at the Rhine in November. Henry sent troops to the Rhine to prevent the negotiations.
[201]
The papal legate, Cardinal Bernard, excommunicated Henry on 12 November 1077.
[202]
[203]
Henry sent Bishops
Benno II of Osnabrück
and
Theoderic of Verdun
to Rome to begin negotiations with the Pope, whose position in Italy had been weakening.
[204]
The Pope appointed a new legate, whose name was not recorded, to represent him in Germany. The papal legate celebrated Easter with Henry in Cologne on 8 April 1078, demonstrating that the Pope had not regarded Henry's excommunication as valid.
[204]
Henry invaded Lotharingia and forced Bishop Herman of Metz into exile,
[205]
but Berthold of Zähringen and Welf of Bavaria inflicted defeats on his Swabian and
Franconian
supporters.
[206]
Rudolf of Rheinfelden hurried to Franconia and met Henry and his army of 12,000 Franconian peasants at Mellrichstadt on 7 August.
[206]
The
Battle of Mellrichstadt
proved indecisive.
[207]
Rudolf of Rheinfelden dying after losing his right hand in the Battle on the Elster in 1080 (engraving by Bernhard Rode, 1781)
Pope Gregory prohibited all clerics from receiving royal appointments to bishoprics or abbeys in November 1078.
[208]
[209]
The royal investiture was a basic element of royal administration. The ring and
crosier
the prelates received from monarchs during their installation symbolised their mutual dependence.
[210]
At the February 1079 synod of Lent, Henry's opponents, Bishops
Altmann of Passau
and Herman of Metz, convinced the Pope to send new legates to Germany, but the Pope forbade his legates to pass judgement against the prelates who had been appointed by Henry.
[211]
Henry confiscated Rudolf of Rheinfelden's inherited Swabian estates and ceded them to Bishop
Burchard of Lausanne
in March.
[212]
In the same month, he made a wealthy local aristocrat,
Frederick of Büren
, duke of Swabia.
[203]
[213]
Frederick could only take possession of the lands north of the Danube, because Rudolf of Rheinfelden's son,
Berthold
, asserted his authority over the southern parts of Swabia.
[214]
Henry met with the papal legates, Bishops
Peter of Albano
and
Udalric of Padua
, in Regensburg on 12 May 1079.
[215]
They convinced him to send envoys to
Fritzlar
to begin negotiations with Rudolf of Rheinfelden with their mediation.
[215]
At the Fritzlar conference, the parties agreed to hold a new meeting at Würzburg, but Rudolf failed to appoint his representatives, thinking Henry had bribed the papal legates.
[216]
Henry invaded Saxony in August, but Rudolf persuaded the aristocrats in Henry's army to obtain his consent to a truce.
[216]
Henry sent agents to Saxony, and they convinced many Saxon leaders to desert the anti-king.
[216]
He mustered troops from the German duchies, Burgundy and Bohemia and invaded Saxony in January 1080.
[217]
He could not surprise Rudolf who
defeated Henry's army at Flarchheim
on 27 January. Rudolf did not take advantage of his victory, however, because the Saxons who had deserted him did not return to his camp.
[218]
Henry sent envoys to the synod of Lent in Rome and demanded the Pope excommunicate Rudolf, hinting he was ready to appoint an antipope to achieve his goal.
[210]
[219]
Instead Pope Gregory excommunicated and deposed Henry and acknowledged Rudolf as the lawful king.
[210]
[220]
A treatise, known as
The Defence of King Henry
, was published in Henry's defence which emphasised his hereditary claim to his realms. The treatise, likely written by the jurist
Petrus Crassus
, uses arguments based on Roman Law, showing the
corpus juris civilis
had already been studied in Italy. Before returning to Germany, Henry's envoys, Archbishop Liemar of Bremen and Bishop
Rupert of Bamberg
, raised a rebellion against the Pope's principal Italian ally Matilda of Tuscany. They also secured the support of northern Italian aristocrats for Henry.
[221]
Henry's second excommunication was less harmful to his position than the previous ban.
[185]
He held a council in Mainz on 31 May 1080.
[221]
The nineteen German prelates and aristocrats who attended the council deposed Pope Gregory, labelling him as "the accused disturber of divine and human laws".
[221]
Henry held a second
synod in Brixen
. Nineteen Italian, seven German and a lone Burgundian prelate confirmed the Pope's deposition 25 June, accusing him of simony, heresy and other sins.
[210]
[222]
The synod elected Archbishop
Wibert of Ravenna
pope.
[223]
[224]
Wibert assumed the name Clement III in reference to
Pope Clement II
who had been the first reformist pope to be elected through the intervention of Henry's father.
[224]
Henry returned to Germany and assembled his troops for a new invasion of Saxony.
[225]
Henry and Rudolf's armies met at
Hohenmölsen
on 14 October 1080.
[225]
[226]
Henry's forces
were defeated
but it was a Pyrrhic victory for Rudolf, who lost his right hand and died.
[226]
[227]
Henry took full advantage of the circumstances of Rudolf's death, describing it as a punishment for oath breaking.
[223]
[228]
He began negotiations with the Saxons, offering to appoint his son, Conrad, king of Saxony, but Otto of Nordheim persuaded his fellows to refuse the offer.
[229]
Imperial coronation
[
edit
]
Henry IV (left) and Antipope Clement III (middle-right) during Henry's imperial coronation (from Otto of Freising's
Chronicle or History of the Two Cities
, 1157)
Henry led a small army to Italy in March 1081.
[230]
His Italian supporters had defeated Matilda of Tuscany's troops in the previous year at the
battle of Volta Mantovana
, enabling him to reach Rome without resistance.
[231]
The Romans, however, remained loyal to Pope Gregory VII and Henry had to withdraw to northern Italy in late June.
[232]
He began negotiations with the envoys of the Byzantine Emperor
Alexios I Komnenos
about an alliance against Robert Guiscard.
[233]
He granted privileges to Lucca and Pisa, releasing them from Matilda's lordship.
[234]
While Henry was in Italy, the Saxons invaded Franconia.
[235]
Henry's southern German opponents elected Welf's kinsman,
Hermann of Salm
, king at a poorly attended assembly early in August. The Saxons only paid homage to Hermann four months later.
[223]
[236]
Henry left Italy for Germany in the autumn of 1081 but returned in February 1082.
[237]
He laid siege to Rome but could not break the Romans' resistance.
[238]
He charged Antipope Clement with the siege of Rome and began devastating Matilda's domains.
[239]
Rumours of Hermann of Salm's plans to invade Italy forced Henry to remain in northern Italy, but Hermann did not risk an Italian campaign.
[240]
Henry returned to the siege of Rome at the end of 1082.
[240]
Emperor Alexios sent 144,000 gold pieces to him as a token of their friendship and promised a further 216,000 gold pieces in return for his support against Robert Guiscard.
[241]
The treasure enabled Henry to bribe Roman aristocrats, and his troops captured the
Leonine City
in Rome on 3 June 1083. Pope Gregory VII continued to resist in the
Castel Sant'Angelo
.
[242]
[243]
Henry withdrew from Rome again in early July. He concluded a secret treaty with the Roman aristocrats who promised to induce Gregory to crown Henry emperor or to elect another pope.
[244]
Henry launched a military campaign against Robert Guiscard in February and March 1084.
[245]
During his absence, the Antipope convinced more than ten cardinals to desert Pope Gregory VII. They were followed by other clerics and papal officials.
[246]
[247]
Resistance against Henry collapsed, and he entered Rome on 21 March.
[245]
[246]
Clement was installed as pope and he crowned Henry emperor in
St Peter's Basilica
on 1 April.
[243]
[248]
Henry stayed in the
Lateran Palace
for six weeks. He left Rome before Robert Guiscard came to Gregory VII's rescue on 24 May.
[249]
Robert's troops
sacked Rome
, outraging the Romans, and Gregory had to leave Rome for
Salerno
.
[243]
[250]
Henry ordered his Italian supporters to conquer Matilda of Tuscany's lands before he returned to Germany. However, her army routed his allies at the
Battle of Sorbara
on 2 July.
[249]
Reign as emperor
[
edit
]
Consolidation
[
edit
]
Pope Gregory VII repeated Henry's excommunication in late 1084, but many of the Pope's former supporters came to pay homage to Henry as emperor at Cologne at Christmas.
[251]
His supporters and opponents held a joint conference on the river
Werra
on 20 January 1085 but could not reach a compromise.
[252]
The Saxon Count
Theoderic II of Katlenburg
and Bishop
Udo of Hildesheim
entered into secret negotiations with Henry during the conference, but the Saxons who remained hostile to Henry soon murdered Theoderic and forced the bishop to flee from Saxony.
[253]
After the bishop persuaded Henry to pledge he would respect the Saxons' liberties, many rebels laid down their arms.
[254]
Welf, Duke of Bavaria—a wealthy German aristocrat with flexible loyalties during Henry's conflicts with the Papacy (a late-15th-century painting)
The papal legate, Cardinal
Odo of Ostia
, summoned the German prelates who were loyal to Pope Gregory VII to a synod at
Quedlinburg
.
[255]
The synod issued a decree that papal judgements could not be questioned and forbade the faithful to make contact with those who had been excommunicated.
[255]
In response, Henry held a general assembly in Mainz in late April or early May.
[254]
[256]
Three or four archbishops and fifteen bishops obeyed his summons. They deposed their peers—two archbishops and thirteen bishops—who had failed to come to Mainz.
[254]
[45]
The synod also established the "
Peace of God
" in Germany, prohibiting armed conflicts during the main Christian festivals.
[256]
[257]
Vratislaus II of Bohemia, who had always been Henry's loyal supporter, was rewarded with the title of king during this meeting.
[258]
Pope Gregory VII died in Salerno on 25 May 1085. Henry exploited his most prominent opponent's death to consolidate his position.
[259]
Henry visited Lower Lorraine to end a conflict between his two supporters, Bishops Theoderic of Verdun and
Henry of Liège
in June 1085.
[260]
He granted the
County of Verdun
to Henry of Liège's kinsman, Godfrey of Bouillon, and compensated Bishop Theoderic with estates confiscated from Matilda of Tuscany.
[261]
Peace was not restored, however, because Godfrey of Bouillon soon laid claim to Matilda's estates.
[261]
Henry invaded Saxony, reaching as far as Magdeburg in July.
[262]
Hermann of Salm,
Hartwig, Archbishop of Magdeburg
and the archbishop's three
suffragans
fled to Denmark and the Saxons paid homage to Henry.
[262]
Henry did not restore the rebels' confiscated estates and appointed new officials. The Saxons rose up in a new rebellion and forced Henry to withdraw to Franconia.
[263]
Henry mustered a new army and invaded Saxony in January 1086, but the Saxons avoided a pitched battle.
[264]
Henry withdrew to Regensburg.
Welf of Bavaria
laid siege to the town at Easter, but Henry was relieved by his supporters.
[265]
Henry's Bavarian, Swabian and Saxon opponents laid siege to Würzburg in July 1086, because possession of the town could secure their uninterrupted communication.
[265]
Henry decided to force them to abandon the siege, but the rebels routed his army in the
Battle of Pleichfeld
on 11 August.
[266]
Henry launched a military campaign against his enemies in Bavaria.
[267]
In an attempt to restore peace, Bavarian and Swabian aristocrats from both kings' camps held a joint conference in
Oppenheim
in February 1087. Henry did not attend.
[267]
He went to Aachen where his son, Conrad, was crowned his co-ruler on 30 May.
[256]
[267]
On this occasion Henry likely rewarded Godfrey of Bouillon with the Duchy of Lower Lorraine.
[268]
A new joint conference of the German prelates and aristocrats assembled at Speyer in August 1087. Henry's opponents were willing to pay homage to him provided he had been absolved by the Pope. Henry refused them, maintaining he had been unlawfully excommunicated. Pope Gregory VII's successor,
Pope Victor III
, held a synod in
Benevento
around the same time. The synod passed no resolution about Henry, suggesting the new Pope had adopted a conciliatory policy.
[269]
A sudden illness prevented Henry from invading Saxony in October. After his recovery he launched a military expedition against the Saxon rebels. One of the rebel leaders,
Egbert II of Brunswick
, began to negotiate his surrender. Henry offered him the
Margravate of Meissen
, but Egbert decided to continue the fight against Henry after two Saxon prelates, Hartwig of Magdeburg and Burchard of Halberstadt, promised to achieve his election as king of Germany.
[270]
The two prelates could not keep their promise, and Egbert swore fealty to Henry in early 1088.
[271]
Egbert's about-face and Burchard's unexpected death on 7 April 1088 accelerated the disintegration of the Saxon rebels' camp.
[272]
[273]
Hartwig of Magdeburg and his suffragans hurried to pay homage to Henry, and were followed to Henry's court by prominent Saxon aristocrats.
[273]
Henry appointed Hartwig to be his lieutenant in Saxony.
[274]
Abandoned by his principal allies, the ailing Hermann of Salm sought Henry's permission to leave Saxony for his native Lorraine. His request was granted and he died in his homeland on 28 September 1088.
[272]
[274]
Egbert of Brunswick rose up in a new rebellion and defeated Henry's army near Gleichen on 25 December.
[275]
Egbert's estates were confiscated in February 1089.
[276]
Henry, who had been widowed, went to Cologne to celebrate a new marriage with
Eupraxia of Kiev
in the summer of 1089.
[277]
In the autumn, Henry returned to Saxony to prevent Egbert from attacking Hildesheim, but he continued to resist.
[276]
Return to Italy
[
edit
]
Henry began negotiations with his Bavarian and Swabian opponents.
[278]
They were willing to surrender, but they demanded the deposition of Antipope Clement III.
[278]
Henry was inclined to accept their offer, but his bishops dissuaded him, fearing they would also be dismissed after the Antipope's fall.
[278]
To prevent further negotiations between the Emperor and his opponents, Pope Urban II mediated a marriage alliance between Welf I of Bavaria's 18-year-old son,
Welf the Fat
, and the 43-year-old Matilda of Tuscany in the autumn of 1089.
[279]
[280]
Henry decided to launch a new invasion of Matilda's domains.
[281]
The
Jews of Speyer
approached him around this time for the confirmation of their rights that had been granted by Bishop
Rüdiger Huzmann
.
[282]
He summarised their liberties in a diploma, protecting them against physical assaults and prohibiting their forced baptism.
[283]
He issued a similar document for the Jews of Worms.
[284]
Henry was often in need of cash and according to Robinson, both communities had probably paid a significant sum of money in return for his protection.
[285]
Henry invaded Matilda's domains in March 1090, forcing her to seek refuge in the mountains in April.
[281]
The retainers of Henry's sister, Abbess
Adelaide of Quedlinburg
, killed Egbert of Brunswick on 3 July 1090.
[246]
[286]
Henry made Egbert's brother-in-law,
Henry of Nordheim
, his principal representative in Saxony.
[286]
Egbert's death put an end to Saxon opposition to the Emperor's rule, because he had secured Nordheim's loyalty with land grants.
[246]
[287]
Henry continued his Italian campaign and captured Matilda's fortresses north of the river
Po
at the end of 1091.
[288]
In June 1092, Henry crossed the Po and forced Matilda to begin negotiations for her surrender, but she and her vassals refused to acknowledge Clement III as the lawful pope.
[289]
Henry laid siege to Canossa, but the garrison made a surprise attack on his army, forcing him to abandon the siege in October.
[290]
Henry's Swabian opponents elected the late Berthold of Rheinfelden's brother-in-law,
Berthold II of Zähringen
, to be their duke and he proclaimed himself the "vassal of St Peter" (that is of the Holy See).
[291]
Henry had to send his German troops back to Germany to fight in Swabia and Bavaria.
[292]
He began negotiations with King
Ladislaus I of Hungary
about an alliance, but Welf I prevented their meeting.
[292]
Henry was forced to retreat to Pavia and Matilda's troops recaptured her fortresses.
[293]
Family feuds
[
edit
]
Henry and his two sons, Henry and Conrad
(upper line)
(from the 11th-century
Evangelion of Saint Emmeram's Abbey
)
Matilda of Tuscany and her husband managed to turn Henry's heir, Conrad, against him in the spring or summer of 1093.
[280]
[292]
Henry had Conrad captured, but he escaped to Milan.
[293]
According to
Bernold of Constance
, Henry tried to commit suicide after his son's rebellion,
[294]
though Bernold probably invented this story to make a comparison between Henry and King
Saul
.
[295]
Conrad's disloyalty aroused Henry's suspicion of his relatives, and he put his wife under strict supervision, allegedly for her infidelity.
[294]
[296]
Four Lombard towns (Milan,
Cremona
,
Lodi
and Piacenza) made an alliance with Matilda of Tuscany.
[293]
Henry fled to Verona whose
margrave
,
Henry of Eppenstein
, and Eppenstein's brother, Patriarch
Udalric of Aquileia
, were his last supporters in Italy.
[297]
Henry's authority remained limited to north-eastern Italy, and Matilda and Welf I's troops prevented his return to Germany.
[298]
[299]
Empress Eupraxia decided to desert Henry and sought Matilda's assistance to rescue her from her house arrest early in 1094. Matilda sent a small force of soldiers to Verona who liberated the Empress and accompanied her to Tuscany.
[300]
On meeting with Matilda, Eupraxia presented serious charges against her husband, accusing him of debauchery and group rape. She publicly repeated the charges in Pope Urban II's presence at the
Council of Piacenza
in March 1095.
[300]
[301]
The Pope endorsed her words and confirmed Conrad's claim to the throne, recognizing him as the lawful king in April.
[294]
Henry's enemies gladly spread Eupraxia's accusations, but modern scholars have regarded her statements as an effective propaganda tool against Henry, likely fabricated by Matilda's advisors.
[299]
The Pope departed from Piacenza to France in triumph, but the teenage Welf the Fat left his middle-aged wife around the same time.
[302]
The separation of Matilda and her husband came as a severe blow to the Pope, because the young Welf's father, Welf I, soon sought a reconciliation with Henry.
[280]
[303]
[304]
Henry also conducted negotiations with
Doge
Vitale Faliero
in Venice in June 1095. They renewed a commercial treaty and Faliero agreed to continue to pay a yearly tribute to the Emperor.
[305]
Pope Urban II proclaimed the
First Crusade
at the
Council of Clermont
in November 1095.
[306]
[307]
The council also prohibited the bishops and abbots from swearing fealty to secular rulers.
[308]
The first crusader bands, composed mainly of commoners and impoverished knights, departed for the
Holy Land
early in 1096.
[309]
They attacked the towns along the Rhine and
massacred thousands of Jews
.
[309]
[310]
After the first
pogroms
, the Jews sent a letter to Henry, seeking his protection.
[285]
Henry ordered the German bishops, dukes and counts to protect the Jewish communities, but they could rarely prevent the mob from persecuting them.
[285]
[311]
Restoration
[
edit
]
Welf of Bavaria's father,
Adalbert Azzo II of Este
, mediated a reconciliation between his son and the Emperor in early 1096.
[304]
Henry restored Bavaria to Welf who lifted the blockade of the Alpine passes, enabling Henry to return to Germany in May.
[312]
[313]
Aristocrats who had rebelled against Henry came to pay homage to him at assemblies held in Regensburg, Nuremberg and Mainz.
[314]
He allowed the Jews, who had been forcibly converted to Christianity, to return to Judaism.
[311]
[315]
In early 1098, Berthold II of Zähringen was also reconciled with Henry who exempted his domains from the jurisdiction of the dukes of Swabia and rewarded him with the hereditary title of
duke
.
[314]
[316]
The German magnates and prelates deposed Henry's rebellious son, Conrad, and elected his 12-year-old brother,
Henry V
, as Henry's co-ruler in May 1098. Conrad was abandoned by his allies and died forgotten in Tuscany.
[317]
[318]
While in Mainz, Henry ordered an investigation into the missing property of the Jews who had been murdered by the crusaders.
[315]
Several witnesses stated that Archbishop
Ruthard of Mainz
and his kinsmen had stolen large portions of it.
[315]
Fearing retribution, the Archbishop and his kinsmen fled to Thuringia and began plotting against Henry.
[311]
[315]
Mikveh
(Jewish ritual bath) in Speyer. Henry summarised the local Jews' liberties in a diploma in 1090.
Bretislav II
, who had succeeded King Vratislaus as Duke of Bohemia, met Henry in Regensburg at Eastertide 1099. He wanted to alter the traditional
order of succession
to the Bohemian throne in favour of his brother,
Bořivoj II
.
[319]
Henry granted his request and invested Bořivoj with Bohemia on 19 April. Although the dukes of Bohemia had acknowledged the German monarchs' suzerainty, this was the first occasion on which a Bohemian duke was invested in the same manner as the rulers of the German duchies.
[320]
The restoration of public order was one of Henry's principal goals during the next months.
[321]
He held assemblies at Bamberg and Mainz and ordered the (mainly Franconian and Saxon) magnates who were present to pursue robbers and thieves.
[321]
Antipope Clement III died on 8 September 1100, and his cardinals elected
Theoderic of Albano
as his successor.
[322]
[323]
Henry's Italian supporters acknowledged Theoderic as the lawful pope, but Henry did not make contact with him.
[317]
[321]
Count
Henry of Limburg
captured properties of
Prüm Abbey
.
[324]
The Emperor laid siege to Limburg, forcing the Count to surrender in May 1101.
[325]
The Emperor soon forgave Henry of Limburg for his rebellion and made him duke of Lower Lorraine before the end of the year.
[325]
An assembly of the German leaders proposed that Henry make peace with Pope Urban II's successor,
Paschal II
, in late 1101; there is no proof Henry followed their advice.
[326]
Pope Paschal II was determined to overcome Henry and ordered his legate, Bishop
Gebhard of Constance
, to keep the resistance against the Emperor alive in Germany.
[326]
The papal synod confirmed Henry's excommunication in the
Lateran Basilica
on 3 April.
[317]
[327]
Robert II, Count of Flanders
, allied with Bishop
Manasses of Cambrai
—a Frenchman supported by the Pope—against
Walcher
whom Henry had appointed to replace Manasses as
bishop of Cambrai
.
[328]
Robert laid siege to
Cambrai
; Henry came to Walcher's rescue, forcing Robert to lift the siege in October 1102, but Robert resumed the war on Walcher soon after Henry left Cambrai.
[329]
Henry held a general assembly in Mainz on 6 January 1103,
[327]
and proclaimed the
Reichsfriede
(imperial peace), prohibiting feuds and other acts of violence, for the first time in the whole empire.
[317]
[322]
He threatened those who broke the peace with mutilation, without allowing the wealthy to pay penance.
[322]
Henry also announced he was planning to launch a crusade to the Holy Land.
[322]
He addressed a letter to Hugh of Cluny. In it he explained to his godfather he intended to "make good the ruin of the Church, which was caused by us, through the restoration of peace and justice".
[330]
His correspondence with Hugh (who was Pope Paschal II's staunch supporter) suggests Henry was seeking reconciliation.
[331]
The Pope regarded Henry as the "chief of the heretics". He granted Robert II of Flanders the "remission of sins" (the same spiritual privilege granted to crusaders) for his fight against the Emperor's supporters.
[327]
[332]
Robert II, however, feared losing his imperial fiefs and swore fealty to Henry in
Liège
on 29 June 1103.
[333]
Fall
[
edit
]
Henry IV abdicates in favour of Henry V (from the early-12th-century
Chronicle
of
Ekkehard of Aura
).
A Bavarian count, Sigehard of Burghausen, criticised Henry for his favouritism towards the Saxon and Franconian aristocrats in Regensburg in January 1104.
[334]
He had come to Regensburg accompanied by a large retinue arousing Henry's suspicion he was staging a plot.
[334]
After Sigehard dismissed his retainers, a band of
ministeriales
and burghers murdered him on 4 February.
[335]
[336]
The
ministeriales
likely took revenge on Sigehard for his arbitration in a case relating to their peers. Sigehard's kinsmen and other aristocrats, however, blamed Henry for his death saying he had failed to defend him.
[317]
[337]
Archbishop Hartwig of Magdeburg died in autumn 1104.
[338]
His brother, Burgrave Herman of Magdeburg, and their nephew, Hartwig, departed for Henry's court most probably to achieve the younger Hartwig's appointment to the archbishopric, but Count
Theoderic III of Katlenburg
captured and imprisoned them for simony.
[338]
Henry launched a punitive campaign against Theoderic.
[338]
The military expedition ended abruptly because Henry's eighteen-year-old son unexpectedly deserted him on 12 December.
[338]
The younger Henry later said that his father's failure to receive an absolution from the Pope had prompted his rebellion. His nearly contemporaneous biography claims that he wanted to secure the aristocrats' support before his ailing father's death to avoid a succession crisis.
[339]
[340]
The discontented Bavarian aristocrats hurried to the young King and Pope Paschal II absolved him from excommunication early in 1105.
[313]
[341]
Henry sent envoys to his son, who refused to negotiate with an excommunicated man.
[341]
Most Swabian and eastern Franconian aristocrats joined the younger Henry's rebellion. He also secured the Saxons' support during a visit to Saxony in April 1105.
[342]
He launched a military campaign against Mainz to restore Archbishop Ruthard to his see in late June 1105, but his father's supporters prevented him crossing the Rhine.
[343]
Henry expelled his son's troops from Würzburg in August, but his authority was quickly waning.
[344]
His son took advantage of Frederick of Büren's death to take control of Swabia.
[344]
Leopold III, Margrave of Austria
, and Bořivoj II, Duke of Bohemia, deserted the Emperor at Regensburg in late September, though Bořivoj soon repented his betrayal,
[345]
and supported Henry's flight from Regensburg to Saxony. His brother-in-law, Count
Wiprecht of Groitzsch
, accompanied Henry as far as Mainz in late October.
[346]
Already in despair, Henry sent a letter to his son, asking him "not to persist in his desire to depose him from the kingship"; the younger Henry wanted no compromise.
[347]
Henry moved from Mainz to
Hammerstein
and then to Cologne. He decided to return to Mainz, because he wanted to defend himself at the German princes' assembly his son had convoked.
[347]
The younger Henry met with his father at
Koblenz
on 21 December. Henry dismissed his retinue, because his son promised a safe conduct to Mainz.
[348]
Instead, he was captured and brought to the castle of
Böckelheim
,
[349]
[350]
where he was forced to cede the royal insignia to his son.
[348]
The burghers of Mainz remained loyal to Henry, so his son summoned the German princes instead to an assembly at
Ingelheim
.
[349]
Henry was allowed to attend the meeting, but it was dominated by his enemies.
[349]
Having no other choice, he abdicated in his son's favour on 31 December.
[351]
Later, he said he resigned only because of his "fears of imminent murder or execution".
[352]
Last year
[
edit
]
Henry was staying in Ingelheim after his abdication, but his supporters warned him his son had decided to imprison or execute him. In early February 1106, he fled to Cologne where he was received by the townspeople with great respect. He declined all ceremonies, demonstrating that he was doing penance for his sins. His loyal supporter,
Othbert, Bishop of Liège
, made peace with Henry of Limburg to secure the Duke's support. Henry joined them at Liège and mediated a reconciliation between Henry of Limburg and
Albert III, Count of Namur
. Robert II of Flanders also promised him assistance.
[353]
Henry addressed a letter to Hugh of Cluny, offering to accept all his terms in return for an absolution.
[354]
He also wrote letters to his son, the German princes and King
Philip I of France
. All of them show he was determined to regain his throne.
[348]
Henry V invaded Lorraine, but his father's supporters routed his army at
Visé
on 22 March 1106.
[348]
[354]
Henry of Limburg and the burghers of Cologne and Liège jointly persuaded the elderly Henry to "resume the office of emperor".
[355]
Henry V laid siege to Cologne early in July but had to withdraw from the well-fortified town three or four weeks later.
[355]
The deposed Emperor sent letters to the German princes accusing his son of treachery and hypocrisy.
[356]
He fell unexpectedly ill and died in Liège on 7 August.
[357]
[358]
On his deathbed, he asked his son to pardon his supporters and to have him buried next to his ancestors in
Speyer Cathedral
.
[357]
[359]
Bishop Othbert buried Henry in
Liège Cathedral
, but the excommunicated Emperor's body could not rest in a consecrated place.
[357]
[360]
Eight days later, his corpse was unearthed and buried in an unconsecrated
chapel
near Liège. On 24 August his son ordered a new exhumation because he wanted to execute Henry's last will.
[361]
The townspeople of Liège tried to prevent the transfer of Henry's corpse, but it was carried in a
sarcophagus
to Speyer. The sarcophagus was placed in an unconsecrated chapel of the Speyer Cathedral on 3 September. Five years later, Pope Paschal II granted permission to the younger Henry to bury his father as he had requested. Henry IV was buried next to Henry III in the cathedral on 7 August 1111.
[361]
Legacy
[
edit
]
Henry's conflicts with his subjects, both sons,
[350]
his wives and with the popes gave rise to a rich polemical literature during his lifetime. Both his supporters and his opponents based their portraits of Henry on two early medieval works:
The Twelve Abuses
contained a discussion about legitimate kingship, while
Isidore of Seville
's
Etymologiae
contrasted kingship with tyranny. Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the
Song of the Saxon War
praised him as a "king second to none in his piety" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. The
Vita Heinrici IV imperatoris
, an anonymous biography completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the
liberal arts
. In contrast
Lambert of Hersfeld
stated Henry had inherited a peaceful realm, but he "rendered it filthy, despicable, bloodstained, a prey to internal conflicts". Lambert also emphasised that Henry destroyed and robbed churches and put freemen into servitude.
[362]
Rumours of Henry's immorality established his bad reputation for centuries.
[363]
The Saxons were the first to accuse him of debauchery and demanded he dismiss the "swarm of concubines with whom he slept".
[364]
Polemical writings spreading in Germany after 1085 accused Henry of
incest
and
pederasty
, also claiming that he had fathered illegitimate children.
[365]
Isidore of Seville listed immoral sexual practices among the tyrants' characteristics.
[363]
Consequently, as Robinson emphasises, allegations of Henry's alleged sexual misconduct "provided his opponents with a useful polemical weapon".
[365]
Henry was not a successful military commander, primarily because he did not avoid pitched battles, in contrast with most 11th-century military leaders. He could likely adopt this high-risk strategy because he often mustered his troops from among merchants and peasants who were regarded as expendable. He lost most of his major battles; his sole victory at Homburg was primarily attributed to Rudolf of Rheinfelden by their contemporaries.
[366]
On the other hand, Henry's adaptability and openness to compromise and his preference for dilatory tactics enabled him to survive most crises of his reign.
[367]
Henry's penitential "Walk to Canossa" developed into a powerful metaphor. Catholic clerics were the first to adopt it, regarding it as the symbol of the triumph of the Holy See over an immoral monarch. For 19th-century Protestant German nationalists, the
Gang nach Canossa
("Road to Canossa") symbolized the humiliation of Germany by a haughty pope.
Otto von Bismarck
proudly declared before the
Reichstag
that "Don't worry, we are not going to Canossa, neither physically nor spiritually!" during
his campaign against political Catholicism
[368]
on 14 May 1872.
[369]
Historians have adopted more sophisticated approaches. They emphasize that penance and reconciliation were integral parts of medieval life, so an anointed king's excommunication was more disturbing for Henry's contemporaries than his act of penance at Canossa.
[370]
Henry, as Schutz concludes, "cleverly maneuvered the pope into a position in which he had to absolve him", but Gregory VII reduced him "from Vicar of Christ to being a mere layman".
[188]
Henry's death did not put an end to the Investiture Controversy. A renowned French lawyer, Bishop
Ivo of Chartres
, and his pupil,
Hugh of Fleury
, had paved the road to a compromise already in Henry's lifetime. They actually adopted an old view, condemned by reformist clerics, making a distinction between the secular possessions and properties of bishoprics and abbeys (
temporalities
), and the ecclesiastical authority and sacramental powers of the bishops and abbots (
spiritualities
). In 1122, Henry V and
Pope Calixtus II
included a similar distinction in their
Concordat of Worms
, whereby the Emperor renounced the right to install the prelates in their ecclesiastical offices with ring and staff in return for the right to invest them with their secular possessions using the sceptre.
[371]
[372]
However, the German monarchs' right to acquire a dead prelate's treasury, introduced by Henry, remained an important source of wealth, especially during the reigns of
Frederick Barbarossa
and
Henry VI
in the second half of the 12th century.
[116]
Family
[
edit
]
Henry IV and his first wife, Bertha of Savoy (11th-century painting)
Henry's first wife, Bertha of Savoy, was a year younger than he.
[373]
Until 5 August 1068, Henry regularly mentioned her as "consort of our kingdom and our marriage-bed" in his diplomas.
[374]
Her disappearance from the diplomas was the sign of a growing disaffection.
[375]
Henry sought a divorce at a general assembly in June 1069 stating their marriage had not been
consummated
.
[99]
[375]
The assembled German aristocrats referred his request to a synod, which passed the matter to the Holy See in early October.
[374]
Pope Alexander II made it clear Henry would only be crowned emperor if he abandoned his plan.
[376]
Henry obeyed and Bertha was again mentioned regularly in his diplomas from 26 October 1069.
[376]
She died on 27 December 1087.
[373]
Bertha gave birth to five children, but two of them—Adelaide and Henry—died in infancy.
[373]
Her surviving children were:
[373]
[377]
Agnes
, who was born in 1072 or 1073, married Frederick of Büren and then Leopold III of Austria;
Conrad, who rose up against Henry, was born in 1074;
Henry, who dethroned his father, was born in 1086.
The
Morkinskinna
—the earliest Icelandic chronicle of the Norwegian kings—refers to a daughter of an emperor (who must have been identical with Henry for chronological reasons), called Mathilde.
[378]
According to this source,
Magnus III of Norway
exchanged messages with her and also composed a
stanza
for her.
[379]
Other primary sources do not list Mathilde among Henry's children.
[380]
Henry's second wife, Eupraxia (known as Adelaide in Germany), was born around 1068.
[381]
She was the daughter of
Vsevolod I, Grand Prince of Kiev
, but it was not her connection to
Kievan Rus'
, but her first marriage to
Henry of Stade
, Margrave of the Nordmark, that made her an ideal spouse for Henry after her husband died in 1087.
[246]
[382]
Henry of Stade had been a wealthy Saxon aristocrat and his widow's marriage to Henry contributed to his reconciliation with the Saxons.
[256]
Henry and Eupraxia were engaged in 1088.
[373]
In contrast with Bertha, Eupraxia was mentioned in only one of her husband's diplomas, showing that she never gained Henry's confidence.
[383]
After the scandalous end of their marriage, she returned to Kiev where she died on 10 July 1109.

Aeronáutica Agrícola Mexicana SA
(
AAMSA
) was an aircraft manufacturing company in
Mexico
from 1971 to 1984.

1971
as a
joint venture
between
Rockwell International
(30%) and Industrias Unidas SA (70%) to manufacture Rockwell's range of
agricultural aircraft
at a factory in Pasteje.
[1]
Products
[

The shield pattern of the
Heruli seniores
.
The
Heruli
was an
auxilia palatina
unit of the
Late Roman army
, active between the 4th and the 5th century. It was composed of 500 soldiers and was the heir of those ethnic groups that were initially used as auxiliary units of the Roman army and later integrated in the Roman Empire after the
Constitutio Antoniniana
. Their name was derived from the people of the
Heruli
. In the sources they are usually recorded together with the
Batavi
, and it is probable the two units fought together. At the beginning of the 5th century two related units are attested, the
Heruli seniores
in the West and the
Heruli iuniores
in the East.
History
[
edit
]
The
Heruli
probably belonged to the army of the emperor
Julian
, and probably fought in the
Battle of Strasbourg
(357), even if the sources do not mention them.
In 360, before Julian received the order to send most of his troops to Emperor
Constantius II
for a campaign in the East, the
Heruli
, the
Batavi
and two
numeri Moesiacorum
were sent ton Britain under the command of
Lupicinus
, Julian's
magister militum
, probably to counter a rebellion. They embarked at
Bononia
(
Boulogne-sur-Mer
) and arrived at
Rutupiae
. Later the
Batavi
and the
Heruli
returned to the continent, but it is unknown when this happened.
[1]
The Emperors
Valentinian I
and
Valens
divided the army among themselves. Many units were divided into two sub-units, sharing the name of the original unit and each distinguished by the name
seniores
, for the units of the
senior Augustus
Valentinian, and
iuniores
, for the units of the
iunior Augustus
Valens, and aggregated respectively to the
Western Roman army
and to the
Eastern Roman army
.
[2]
In 365, Emperor
Valentinian I
(364-375) had to confront the invading Germans. The barbarians were able to capture the banners of the
Batavi
and
Heruli
units, which were made the object of derision by the raiders until recovered.
[3]
In 367-369 there was a revolt in Britain against Valentinian I, known as
Great Conspiracy
and put down by the later emperor
Theodosius I
. On this occasion, both the
Batavi
and the
Heruli
were sent to Britain, along with the
Iovii
and
Victores
. They landed at
Richborough
and headed for
London
.
[4]
The
Notitia Dignitatum
, a document prepared in the years 400-420, shows the deployment of the
Heruli seniores
under the command of the
magister peditum
for Italy.

Estrogen-related receptor beta
(
ERR-β
), also known as ESRRB or NR3B2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group B, member 2), is a
nuclear receptor
that in humans is encoded by the
ESRRB
(Estrogen Related Receptor Beta)
gene
.
[5]
Function
[
edit
]
ESRRB has been shown to be vital for the transition between a
naïve pluripotent
and primed pluripotent state in mammalian cells, and
NANOG
controls the expression of ESRRB in this scenario.

(

DEM
-ee
;
[1]
February 22, 1944 - April 26, 2017) was an American film and television director, producer and screenwriter whose career spanned more than 30 years.
Beginning his career under
B-movie
producer
Roger Corman
, Demme made his directorial debut with the 1974
women-in-prison
film
Caged Heat
, before becoming known for his casually humanist films
[2]
such as
Melvin and Howard
(1980),
Swing Shift
(1984),
Something Wild
(1986), and
Married to the Mob
(1988). His 1991 psychological horror film
The Silence of the Lambs
won five
Academy Awards
, including
Best Director
and
Best Picture
.
His subsequent films earned similar acclaim, notably the
HIV/AIDS
-themed drama
Philadelphia
(1993), the supernatural
Southern Gothic
Beloved
(1998), the conspiracy thriller
The Manchurian Candidate
(2004), and the independent drama
Rachel Getting Married
(2008).
Demme also directed numerous concert films such as
Stop Making Sense
(1984),
Neil Young: Heart of Gold
(2006), and
Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids
(2016), and worked on several television series as both a producer and director.
Early life
[
edit
]
Demme was born on February 22, 1944, in
Baldwin
,
New York
, the son of Dorothy Louise (
née
Rogers)
[3]
and Robert Eugene Demme, a public relations executive.
[4]
[5]
He was raised in
Rockville Centre, New York
and
Miami
,
[1]
where he graduated from
Southwest Miami High School
[6]
before attending the
University of Florida
.
[7]
Career
[
edit
]
Early films
[
edit
]
Demme broke into feature film working for
exploitation film
producer
Roger Corman
early in his career, co-writing and producing
Angels Hard as They Come
(1971), a motorcycle movie very loosely based on
Rashomon
,
[8]
and
The Hot Box
(1972). He then moved on to directing three films for Corman's studio
New World Pictures
:
Caged Heat
(1974),
Crazy Mama
(1975), and
Fighting Mad
(1976). After
Fighting Mad
, Demme directed the comedy film
Handle with Care
(originally titled
Citizens Band
, 1977) for
Paramount Pictures
. The film was well received by critics,
[9]
but received little promotion,
[10]
and performed poorly at the box office.
[11]
He also directed a 1978 episode of
Columbo
.
[12]
Demme's next film,
Melvin and Howard
(1980), did not get a
wide release
, but received a groundswell of critical acclaim and film award recognition, including Academy Award nominations, winning two of its three nominations (
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress
-
Mary Steenburgen
, and
Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay
-
Bo Goldman
). This acclaim led to the signing of Demme to direct the
Goldie Hawn
and
Kurt Russell
star vehicle
Swing Shift
(1984). Intended as a prestige picture for
Warner Bros.
[13]
as well as a major commercial vehicle for Demme,
[14]
it instead became a troubled production due to the conflicting visions of Demme and star Hawn. Demme ended up renouncing the finished product, and when the film was released in May 1984, it was generally panned by critics and neglected by moviegoers.
[13]
After
Swing Shift
, Demme stepped back from Hollywood to make the
Talking Heads
concert film
Stop Making Sense
(also 1984) which won the
National Society of Film Critics
Award for best documentary;
[15]
the eclectic screwball action-romantic comedy
Something Wild
(1986); a film-version of the stage production
Swimming to Cambodia
(1987), by monologist
Spalding Gray
; and the New York Mafia-by-way-of Downtown comedy
Married to the Mob
(1988).
[a]
Demme formed his production company, Clinica Estetico, with producers
Edward Saxon
and
Peter Saraf
in 1987.
[16]
[17]
They were based out of New York City for fifteen years.
[18]
[19]
Later films
[
edit
]
Demme won the Academy Award for
The Silence of the Lambs
(1991)—one of only three films to win all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress).
[20]
Inspired by his friend
Juan Suárez Botas
's illness with
AIDS
[21]
and fueled by his own moral convictions,
[8]
Demme then used his influence to make
Philadelphia
(1993),
[22]
one of the first major films to address the
AIDS crisis
[22]
and which garnered star
Tom Hanks
his first
Best Actor Oscar
.
[22]
He also co-directed (with his nephew
Ted
) the music video for
Bruce Springsteen
's
Best Song Oscar
-winning "
Streets of Philadelphia
" from the film's soundtrack.
[23]
Jonathan used several of the same actors for both movies.
Subsequently, his films included an adaptation of
Toni Morrison
's
Beloved
(1998), and remakes of two films from the 1960s:
The Truth About Charlie
(2002), based on
Charade
, that starred
Mark Wahlberg
in the
Cary Grant
role; and
The Manchurian Candidate
(2004), with
Denzel Washington
and
Meryl Streep
. Demme's documentary film
Man from Plains
(2007), a documentary about former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter
's promotional tour publicizing his book
Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid
, had its premiere at the
Venice Film Festival
and
Toronto International Film Festival
.
His art-house hit
Rachel Getting Married
(2008) was compared by many critics to Demme's films of the late 1970s and 1980s.
[24]
[25]
[26]
It was included in many 2008 "best of" lists, and received numerous awards and nominations, including an
Academy Award
nomination for
Best Actress
by lead
Anne Hathaway
. In 2010, Demme made his first foray into theater, directing
Family Week
, a play by
Beth Henley
. The play was produced by
MCC Theater
and co-starred
Rosemarie DeWitt
and
Kathleen Chalfant
.
[27]
At one time, Demme was signed on to direct, produce, and write an adaptation of
Stephen King
's sci-fi novel
11/22/63
, but later left the project due to disagreements with King on what should be included in the script.
[28]
He returned to the concert documentary format with
Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids
(2016), which he described as a "performance film, but also a portrait of an artist at a certain moment in the arc of his career",
[21]
and his last project was a history of rock & roll for the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
compiled from footage from Hall of Fame induction ceremonies set to debut in summer 2017.
[21]
Demme directed music videos for artists such as
Suburban Lawns
,
New Order
,
KRS-One
's H.E.A.L. project and
Bruce Springsteen
. He also produced a compilation of
Haitian music
called
Konbit: Burning Rhythms of Haiti
that was released in 1989. (
Lou Reed
selected
Konbit...
as one of his 'picks of 1989').
[29]
Demme was on the board of directors at
Jacob Burns Film Center
in
Pleasantville, New York
. In addition to his role on the board, he curated and hosted a monthly series called
Rarely Seen Cinema
.
[30]
Style
[
edit
]
Throughout 1986-2004, Demme was known for his dramatic close-ups in films. This style of close-ups involves the character looking directly into the camera during crucial moments. According to Demme, this was done to put the viewer into the character's shoes. Beginning with
Rachel Getting Married
(2008), Demme adopted a documentary style of filmmaking.
[31]
[32]
He was known for his use of recurring supporting players, including
Charles Napier
,
Harry Northup
,
Tracey Walter
,
Ann Dowd
,
LisaGay Hamilton
,
Kimberly Elise
, Paul Lazar,
Dean Stockwell
,
Ted Levine
,
Paul Le Mat
,
Mary Steenburgen
,
Jason Robards
and his former producer
Roger Corman
, as well as casting musicians and bands in roles. These included
Sister Carol
,
Chris Isaak
,
Tunde Adebimpe
,
The Feelies
,
Charles Aznavour
, Steve Scales,
The Flirtations
,
Manno Charlemagne
,
Bernie Worrell
,
David Johansen
,
Beau Sia
,
Q Lazzarus
, and
Rick Springfield
.  In addition to Corman, Demme cast a number of other fellow directors in cameos, including
John Sayles
,
Agnès Varda
,
George Romero
,
Sidney Lumet
, and
John Waters
. Many of these performers received opening credits billing in films they appeared in, despite sometimes having only one or two lines.
Writer/director
Paul Thomas Anderson
has paid homage to Demme in his films and has cited him as a major influence in his work. In an interview, Anderson jokingly stated that the three filmmakers who inspired him the most are "Jonathan Demme, Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Demme."
[33]
[34]
Other directors such as
Alexander Payne
and
Wes Anderson
have been known to be inspired by his close-ups in their own work.
[35]
[36]
Political activism
[
edit
]
Demme was involved in various political projects. In 1981, he directed a series of commercials for the liberal advocacy group
People for the American Way
. The
spots
, titled "Eggs",
[37]
"Music",
[38]
[39]
and "Sports",
[40]
were produced by
Norman Lear
and featured
Muhammad Ali
,
Carol Burnett
, and
Goldie Hawn
celebrating
Freedom of Expression
.
[41]
In 1985, he directed a video for
Artists United Against Apartheid
. The short, featured various international musicians including
Afrika Bambaataa
,
Rubén Blades
,
Jimmy Cliff
,
Herbie Hancock
,
Little Steven
,
Run-D.M.C.
, and
Bruce Springsteen
, calling for a boycott of the South African luxury resort
Sun City
during
Apartheid
. His documentary
Haiti Dreams of Democracy
(1988) captured Haiti's era of democratic rebuilding after dictatorship, while his documentary
The Agronomist
(2008) profiled Haitian journalist and human rights activist
Jean Dominique
. Demme spent six years on the documentary
I'm Carolyn Parker
(2011), which highlighted rebuilding efforts in
New Orleans
Lower Ninth Ward
after
Hurricane Katrina
Personal life
[
edit
]
Demme was married twice. His first marriage to Evelyn Purcell ended in divorce.
[42]
In 1987, he married artist Joanne Howard, with whom he had three children.
[1]
He was the uncle of film director
Ted Demme
, who died in 2002.
[43]
Demme's cousin was the
Rev. Robert Wilkinson Castle Jr.
, an Episcopal priest who appeared in some of Demme's films.
Demme was a member of the steering committee of the Friends of the
Apollo Theater, Oberlin, Ohio
, along with
Danny DeVito
and
Rhea Perlman
.
[44]
In 2013, he returned to Oberlin as part of an alumni reunion during the class of 2013 graduation ceremony and received the award for Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts.
[45]
In 2009, Demme signed a petition in support of director
Roman Polanski
, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977
sexual abuse charges
, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown "freely and safely", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door "for actions of which no-one can know the effects."
[46]
[47]
Demme was an avid collector and devotee of
Haitian art
, in particular of
Hector Hyppolite
- so much so that he called it "an addiction". In 2014, he held an auction in Philadelphia selling thousands from his collection, much of which was donated to a cultural center in
Port-au-Prince
.
[48]
Death
[
edit
]
Demme died at his home in
Manhattan
on April 26, 2017, from complications from
esophageal cancer
and
heart disease
; he was 73.
[49]
[1]
"I am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you'd have to design a hurricane to contain him. Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much."
—
Jodie Foster
's statement following Demme's death.
[50]
Director
Brady Corbet
dedicated his 2018 film
Vox Lux
to Demme's memory,
[51]
as did
Luca Guadagnino
with his 2018 film
Suspiria
and Paul Thomas Anderson with his 2017 film
Phantom Thread
starring
Daniel Day Lewis
. Demme is thanked in the credits of
Spike Lee
's 2020 concert film
American Utopia
starring
David Byrne
. The album
A Beginner's Mind
by musicians
Sufjan Stevens
and
Angelo De Augustine
is dedicated to Demme, with one of its songs, "Cimmerian Shade", mentioning him and referencing
The Silence of the Lambs
within its lyrics.

Alberto Marcos Rey
(born 15 February 1974) is a Spanish retired
footballer
who played as a
left-back
.
After not being able to establish himself at
Real Madrid
, he went on to spend 15 professional seasons with
Valladolid
, experiencing two
relegations and one promotion
and appearing in nearly 500 competitive matches.
Club career
[
edit
]
Marcos was born in
Camarma de Esteruelas
,
Community of Madrid
. After emerging through the ranks of
Real Madrid
,
[1]
he played three
La Liga
matches for the
1995 national champions
, his debut coming on 17 April 1994 in a 1-0 away win over
Sevilla FC
. In a subsequent game against
FC Barcelona
, he effectively marked
Bulgarian
international
Hristo Stoichkov
,
[2]
but could never break into the first team.
In the
1995-96 season
, Marcos signed for
Real Valladolid
, going on to be a defensive mainstay for over a decade and eventually gaining
team captaincy
. From
1997
to
2002
he only missed a total of eight league fixtures, and became, late in
2008-09
, the player with most overall matches for the club.
Two seasons earlier
, as the
Castile and León
side returned to the top tier after a two-year absence, he had contributed 29 matches, scoring once.
Marcos suffered various injuries
the following campaign
,
[3]
and appeared in only 21 league games whilst completing just 12, his third worst input in 15 years with Valladolid. In July 2010, at 36 - and following the team's relegation - he decided to leave the club, holding the records of more league games played (438), more official matches (471) and more games (361) and minutes (31.610) in the top flight.
[4]
Later that month, Marcos joined
SD Huesca
of the
Segunda División
, reuniting with former Valladolid coach
Onésimo Sánchez
.
[5]
He was the undisputed starter in his position during
the season
as the
Aragonese
retained their league status, and retired from football in June 2011 to become Valladolid's
director of football
.

Ein Qiniyye
or '
Ayn Qunya
(
Arabic
:
عين قنية
;
Hebrew
:
עֵין קֻנִיֶּה
) is a
Druze
[2]
village in the
Israeli-occupied
southern foothills of
Mount Hermon
, 750 meters above sea level. It was granted
local council
status in 1982. Its inhabitants are mostly
Syrian
citizens with
permanent residency
status in Israel (for more about the status and position of the Golan Heights Druze community see
here
). In 2021 it had a population of 2,172.
[2]
History
Ein Qiniyye is one of the four remaining
Druze-Syrian communities
on the Israeli-occupied side of Mount Hermon and the
Golan Heights
, together with
Majdal Shams
,
Mas'ade
and
Buq'ata
. Geographically a distinction is made between the Golan Heights and Mount Hermon, the boundary being marked by the Sa'ar Stream; however, administratively usually they are lumped together. Ein Qiniyye and Majdal Shams are on the Hermon side of the boundary, thus sitting on limestone, while Buq'ata and Mas'ade are on the Golan side, characterised by black volcanic rock (basalt).
[2]
Since the adoption of the 1981
Golan Heights Law
, Ein Qiniyye is under
Israeli civil law
, and incorporated into the Israeli system of local councils. Some of the young people of the village used to study at Syrian universities, but at the end of 2012 a Druze cleric advised them against applying until the
Syrian Civil War
was over.
[3]
Most of the town's residents are
Druze
, but a few
Christians
remain of a much larger community that left the town in the 1940s and 1950s.

Kőröshegy
is a village directly south of
Balatonföldvár
in
Siófok District
,
Somogy County
,
Hungary
.
The settlement is known in Hungary for being a holiday destination near to
Lake Balaton
attracting thousands of visitors yearly. Kőröshegy is also famous for its grapes, wine and the
Viaduct of Kőröshegy
on the
M7 Motorway
which is a symbol of the village.
The settlement is part of the
Balatonboglár wine region
.
[2]
Etymology
[
edit
]
There are several theories about the origin of the name of the village. According to the most accepted one it derives from the name of the tree,
Fraxinus
(
Hungarian
:
Kőris
) which is typical on the settlement. In medieval descriptions this territory was named
Kreuris tue
(
Hungarian
:
Kőristő
). In
Somogy County
people used or use the word
hegy
(English:
mountain
) instead of
domb
(English:
hill
).
[3]
According to the second also popular explanation the fact that the village is surrounded by hills could lead to the world
körös
which meant
kör alakú
(English:
round
).
[4]
Kajetán Darnay
states that the village was named after the
Scythian
king,
Kőrös
who ruled in the region.
[5]
Nicolaus Olahus
, the Archbishop of Esztergom, named the settlement
Kereszthegy
(English:
Cross Mountain
) in his writing from 1536.
István Tikos
referred to Kőröshegy as
Keren
and
Kereszthegy
in 1819.
[6]
Geography
[
edit
]
Halastó
(English:
Fishpond
) in Kőröshegy
Kőröshegy lies 3 km far from the southern shore of
Lake Balaton
in the
Kőröshegy Valley
south of
Balatonföldvár
and
Szántód
. The landscape is dominated by the hills (part of the
Transdanubian Hill Range
). Its deepest point is at 106 m, the highest at 312 m (
Gyugy-tető
). The
Jaba Crook
runs through the village from the south to the north. Kőröshegy is part of the
Balatonboglár Wine Region
.
[7]
History
[
edit
]
Middle Ages
[
edit
]
This place was already inhabited during prehistoric times. The name of the settlement was first mentioned in 1082 in an official decree in which
Ladislaus I
subordinated the village under the
Archdiocese of Veszprém
, meanwhile in the
establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany
(1055) this territory was under the supervision of the
Benedictine
Pannonhalma Abbey
. The first was confirmed later by
Pope Alexander III
(1175) and
Pope Urban II
(1187).
Pope Innocent III
gave a part of
Somogy County
(including Kőröshegy) the Benedictines, but ecclesiastically to the
Archdiocese of Veszprém
.
Under the rule of
Béla IV
, Master Albeus wrote a list of the residents of Kőröshegy, therefore they are all known by names today. In 1376 the village was the seat of the cattle regency of
Pannonhalma Abbey
in
Somogy County
.
Since 1386 it was under royal possession.
Sigismund
awarded the whole village and the nearby
Castle of Fehérkő
to
Miklós Pécznembéli Marczali
and his brother. During the 15th century it was owned by the
Báthory family
and later by
Lajos Perky
, the cavalry captain of
Slavonia
.
Kőröshegy became a
market town
in the late Middle Ages. Before the
arrival of the Turks
Franciscans
settled there. In 1532 12 Franciscans lived in Kőröshegy in their monastery. (Its ruins can be found on the court of the primary school.) During the
Turkish times
the Franciscans left this monastery and the building was used first as a Turkish school then as a stable.
[8]
Ottoman rule
[
edit
]
Kőröshegy lost most of its residents and became a village again. Several people flew into the hills to
Diós-völgy
and
Diós-oldal
near
Gyugy-puszta
because of the harassment of the Turks. In 1563 only 30 tax payers lived there, in 1580 only 35. Hundred years later there were only 18 tay payers. The settlement came under the
Sanjak of
Törökkoppány
in the Ottoman administration.
[9]
The Roman Catholic church was demolished by the Turks, only the walls stood. The residents rebuilt the church in 1671 after the end of the Ottoman times when people settled back to Kőröshegy.

The Széchenyi Mansion
In the 17th century the village came under the possession of the
Szécsényi family
. In 1688
György Széchenyi
, the chief captain of
Egervár
and
Pölöske
, refers to its mansion which had at that time just a ground level. The mansion was rebuilt in
Baroque style
in ca. 1780 adding a first floor above it. The
Szécsényi family
had an important role in vivifying the village. The majority of the population converted to Calvinism until that time. The Calvinists did not have their own church, therefore they were allowed to use the newly rebuilt church together with the Catholics until 1749. In 1759 the Catholics could establish their own parish. The Calvinists built their church in 1784, and in 1794 they expanded it with a wooden tower. Today's reformed church was built between 1813 and 1818.
[11]
During the
Hungarian War of Independence
some residents became soldiers. As the army of the pro-Habsburg
Josip Jelačić
passed through the village the residents inveigled the hostile soldiers in their cellars, where they gave them wine, then they killed them.
[12]
In the 19th century the village developed its industry, water mills and a brick factory were established. They continued to operate the at that time well-known traditional cooper guilds.
[13]
In 1862 there was a huge conflagration in Kőröshegy, when 43 houses were burnt down including the tower of the reformed church, the rectory and the apartment of the teacher and several others got damaged. In 8 years most buildings were renovated and rebuilt.

Classic Albums Live
is a concert series based in
Toronto, Ontario
, in which musicians perform a classic
rock
album in its entirety.  The series was founded in 2003 by Craig Martin, a musician who had previously produced a series of boutique cabaret shows as well as composed music for television and film.
The musicians go to great lengths to faithfully recreate every sound on the original album. They have performed with orchestras, sitarists, choirs and schools. The shows are treated like recitals with the album being performed in its entirety followed by a 'greatest hits' set of the featured artist.
In recent years, the series has presented concerts in a variety of cities, including
Orlando, Florida
, Melbourne, Florida, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Akron, La Mirada, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Lakeland, Coral Springs, New York, New Jersey, Dallas, Houston,
Uncasville, Connecticut
,
Las Vegas, Nevada
, and
Rochester, New York
. On December 17, 2006, Classic Albums Live performed the entire 213-song Beatles song catalogue in one 13-hour concert at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto.
A different lineup performs each album. There is a group of core musicians who are frequently part of the performances, including
Nick Hildyard
, Rob Phillips,
Lindsay Clark
,
Leslea Keurvorst
,
Troy Feener
,
Clifton David
,
Dom Polito
,David Love, Doug Inglis and
Marty Morin
. Occasionally, more famous Canadian musicians are brought in as well, including
Mia Sheard
,
Kim Bingham
,
Nicholas Walsh
, and ex-members of
Moist
. In some venues, they will bring in local musicians to fill needed spots. For example, on June 16, 2006, the group performed the Beatles'
Sgt. Pepper
album at the Hard Rock Live in Orlando; they brought in the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra to fill in on the orchestral parts.
When performing in Toronto, they usually play at
Massey Hall
.

The producer of Classic Albums Live has created a musical called Gig which will run in 2016.

The
Le Redoutable
-class submarine
was a
ballistic missile submarine
class
of the
French Navy
(
Marine Nationale
). In French, the type is called
Sous-marin Nucléaire Lanceur d'Engins
(SNLE), literally "Missile-launching nuclear submarine". When commissioned, they constituted the strategic part of the naval component of the French nuclear triad, then called
Force de frappe
(the aircraft carriers
Clemenceau
and
Foch
constituting the tactical part).
The class entered active service in 1971 with
Redoutable
, six submarines were built in total. All have since been decommissioned. The structural changes in
Inflexible
have seen it regarded as a different class from the early boats. The class has been superseded by the
Triomphant
class
.
Background
[
edit
]
With the
election
of
Charles de Gaulle
as
president of France
, the
French Armed Forces
saw a change in direction. Under the new government, French forces were withdrawn from
NATO
formations due to French unhappiness with American domination of the group. Beginning in the 1960s, French foreign policy would be reshaped to create independence from both of the major opponents of the
Cold War
, the United States and the Soviet Union. This was later defined in the mantra "to deter - to intervene - to defend". From the foreign policy arose the concept of submarine-based "
Force de Dissuassion
", with emphasis on the "to deter", which was the focus of new French naval spending.
[2]
The new nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed submarine force was planned to be of similar size to the British
Royal Navy
. However, unlike the British, the French received no support from other nations and the French nuclear program began with a lack of technological expertise to draw from. Furthermore, the Americans refused to provide the French Navy with
enriched uranium
for the creation of a
nuclear reactor
.
[2]
Nevertheless, the project was authorized in 1963.
[3]
The French Navy resorted to working in conjunction with the civil
French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission
(
French
:
Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives
), which the US allowed to acquire enriched uranium for experimental land use. A nuclear plant was constructed on land at
Cadarache
and the reactor was tested to simulate
nuclear-powered
submarine patrols.
[2]
Other developments made by the groups working on the project include the development of high-tensile steel by France and the adaption of the submarine hull to nuclear propulsion.
[4]
At the same time as the French were developing nuclear propulsion, they were also researching
ballistic missiles
and
nuclear warheads
.
Caissons
were constructed to test fire missiles and by 1967, the submarine
Gymnote
was fitted with the guidance and navigation systems to be tested. The first ballistic missile launch was at the Landes Trials Centre (French:
Centre d'Essais des Landes
) at the end of 1968 and nuclear warheads were tested at
Moruroa
in the Pacific Ocean.
[2]
Description
[
edit
]
Comparison of different nuclear systems: left, the SNLE (
Redoutable
type) with the
M4 missile
; right, the SNLE-NG (
Triomphant
type) with the present
M45 missile
and the future
M51 missile
.
Designated
Sous-marin Nucléaire Lanceur d'Engins
(SNLE) literally "Missile-launching nuclear submarine", the design initially measured 128 metres (419 ft 11 in)
long overall
with a
beam
of 10.6 metres (34 ft 9 in) and a
draught
of 10 metres (32 ft 10 in). The submarines initially
displaced
7,500
tonnes
(7,400
long tons
) surfaced and 9,000 tonnes (8,900 long tons) submerged.
[5]
This later increased to 8,000 tonnes (7,900 long tons) surfaced.
[6]
The submarines were powered by one
pressurised water reactor
providing steam to two
turbines
and two alternators and turning one propeller via a turbo reduction drive creating 12,100 kilowatts (16,200
hp
). The submarines also sported electric emergency propulsion capable of providing a range of 5,000
nautical miles
(9,300 km; 5,800 mi). The vessels could dive more than 200 metres (660 ft) and had a maximum speed of 20
knots
(37 km/h; 23 mph). Each boat had two twin crews comprising 15 officers and 120 men.
[7]
Armament
[
edit
]
The
Redoutable
class all have 16 compartments for
submarine-launched ballistic missiles
.
Redoutable
initially deployed with 16 the
M1 MSBS
(
Mer-Sol Balistique Stratégique
). The M1 missile was a two stage ballistic missile with a 10.4 m (34 ft 1 in) height and each missile weighed 18,000 kg (40,000 lb). The M1 had a 400-
kiloton
warhead and an approximate 2,500 km (1,600 mi) range.
Terrible
was also constructed to carry this missile. The design of
Foudroyant
was altered to carry the improved
M2 MSBS
missile in 1974. The M2 was heavier at 19,800 kg (43,700 lb), had a 500-kiloton warhead and a longer range than the M1. In 1977, both the M1 and M2 were replaced by the
M20 MSBS
.

Incidents and accidents
[
edit

On 4 February 2014 Joy Air flight JR1533 from Taiyuan, China, carrying 7 crew members and 37 passengers, had a mechanical failure on the landing gear while landing at Zhengzhou. This caused landing gear to break and the aircraft's nose cone to hit the tarmac. There were no injuries.
On 10 May 2015, Joy Air flight JR1529 from Yiwu to Fuzhou with 45 passengers and 7 crew landed on Fuzhou runway 3 at about 11:57 but veered off the runway and came to a stop off the runway edge about 500 metres past the runway threshold and about 50 metres off the runway centerline with all gear on soft ground. The engines struck the ground causing the wings to be nearly torn off, and resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and structure. 7 occupants were injured.

Ahsan Habib Bipu
(
Bengali
:
আহসান হাবিব বিপু
; born 30 October 1990) is a Bangladeshi professional
footballer
who plays as a
goalkeeper
for
Bangladesh Premier League
club
Police Football Club
.
Club career
[
edit
]
Although Bipu spent much of his early career with
Mohammedan SC
, he had to move to
Feni SC
in order to gain game time.
[2]
[3]
In 2016, he established himself as Feni's first choice goalkeeper.
[4]
The following year, after the club was relegated from the top-tier, Bipu moved to
Muktijoddha Sangsad KC
.
In October 2018, Bipu underwent surgery for his broken hand, which kept him out of the game for almost five months. However, while still injured a rumour had spread throughout local media about his apparent death. Bipu later gave an interview with
Prothom Alo
clearing the false news.
[5]
On 2 January 2021, Bipu displayed a man of the match performance for Mohammedan SC against
Saif SC
in the quarter-finals of the
2020-21 Federation Cup
. After saving two penalty shots in the tiebreaker, he was compared to former
Black and White
legend
Sayeed Hassan Kanan
.

History
[
edit
]
The original southern entrance building on Euston Road, 1862
Platforms with ventilation shafts
Ordnance Survey map showing station, 1895
The station was opened as "Gower Street" on 10 January 1863 by the
Metropolitan Railway
(MR), the world's first underground railway.
[8]
The line runs east-west under Euston Road at this point. The station originally had entrances in single-storey pavilions with stone-effect
stucco render
on each side of Euston Road with stairs to the platforms.
[9]
The MR was constructed using the
cut-and-cover
method with the tunnel and station platforms directly under the road. The walls to the rear of the platforms were originally lined in buttressed brickwork supporting a brick arch 45 feet 1 inch (13.74 m) wide and 10 feet 4 inches (3.15 m) high composed of between six and twelve layers of brickwork. Ventilation shafts lined with glazed white tiling were spaced along the platforms to let in light from openings in the front gardens of the houses at street level.
[10]
[11]
[12]
In 1864, Parliament authorised the
North Western and Charing Cross Railway
to construct a line to connect the mainline stations at
Euston
and
Charing Cross
. This would have connected to the MR to the west of Gower Street, but the company was unable to raise funds.
[13]
A revised scheme under the name of the
London Central Railway
(LCR) was approved in 1871. The proposals included an interchange at Gower Street with the LCR's platforms north of and parallel to the MR's.
[14]
LCR branches would have connected from east of Gower Street to Euston and
St Pancras
stations. As before, the LCR was unable to raise funding and the scheme was abandoned in 1874.
[15]
In 1890, the MR obtained parliamentary permission to construct a pedestrian subway under Euston Road from the station to the mainline station. This was never constructed.
[16]
[17]
In 1906, the original timber platforms were reconstructed in concrete as a fire precaution related to the
electrification of the MR
.
[18]
The station was given its present name on 1 November 1909.
[8]
Between 1929 and 1931, the station buildings were reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect
C. W. Clark
.
[19]
A bridge was constructed above the tracks so that a single ticket office could be provided in place of the separate ones for each platform.
[20]
At the same time the station platforms were lengthened requiring the closure of Euston Road to enable the roadway and tunnels to be excavated as quickly as possible.
[21]
The brick arch of the tunnel roof and the side walls were removed and replaced with a flat roof on steel beams supported by concrete walls to the rear of the new platforms.
[19]
During World War II, much of the southern side of Euston Road between Gower Street and Gordon Street was destroyed by bombing. When the site was reconstructed post-war the southern entrance was reconstructed again to incorporate it into the corner of the new building that occupied the site. The north entrance remained. In the 1960s, in conjunction with the construction of an underpass at the junction of Euston Road and
Tottenham Court Road
, Euston Road was widened. At this time, the north entrance building was demolished and converted to a simple subway entrance.
In the 21st century, the buildings on the south side of Euston Road were again redeveloped and the station entrance was again reconstructed. Since late 2006, the south entrance is incorporated into the corner of the headquarters of the
Wellcome Trust
with the entrance in Gower Street. A linking pedestrian
subway
connects under Euston Road from the north side. Since 2011, two lifts provide access between the main entrance and the westbound platform.
[1]
Future
[
edit
]
In December 2005,
Network Rail
announced plans
[22]
to create a subway link between the station and
Euston station
as part of the re-development of Euston station. This will create a direct link for users of main line rail services which depart from Euston. These plans would also be pursued during a rebuilding for
High Speed 2
.
[23]

The
social history
of the
United Kingdom
(1979-present) began with
Conservative
Prime Minister,
Margaret Thatcher
(1979-1990) entering government and rejecting the
post-war consensus
in the 1980s. She privatised most state-owned industries and worked to weaken the power and influence of the
trade unions
. The party remained in government throughout most of the 1990s albeit with growing internal difficulties under the leadership of Prime Minister
John Major
(1990-1997).
The "
New Labour
" premiership of
Tony Blair
(1997-2007) accepted many of Thatcher's economic policies, but though he presided over a period of relative economic prosperity, Blair's government grew unpopular after 2002, in part due to Britain's participation in the
War on Terror
and, most controversially, the
Iraq War
. The brief premiership of
Gordon Brown
(2007-2010) was predominantly defined by a series of crises including the
Financial Crisis of 2007 and 2008
and its
consequences
.
The
Coalition government
(2010-2015) formed by
David Cameron
and
Nick Clegg
introduced a
deficit reduction programme
primarily via cuts to public spending. In 2014, a
referendum on Scottish Independence
was held where the electorate in Scotland voted by 55/45% to remain within the United Kingdom. Winning a majority in 2015, the conservatives held a
referendum  on the UK's membership of the EU
the following year where the UK voted by 52/48% to
leave the organisation
. The premiership of
Theresa May
(2016-2019) was defined by the UK's withdrawal from the EU which was completed under the premiership of
Boris Johnson
(2019-2022); his government was also defined by the current
COVID-19 pandemic
.
Other shifts in the UK during the late 20th and early 21st century include the rise of the internet with computerised technology taking an ever greater role in most aspects of life, rising enrolment in
further
and
higher
education among older adolescents and young adults, as well as a diminishing interest in politics with 21st century elections seeing consistently lower turnout than their 20th century counterparts. The New Labour era and current period of consecutive conservative or conservative led governments have seen the
devolution
of substantial powers to Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and, to a lesser extent, parts of England.

Margaret Thatcher
was the dominant political force of the late twentieth century, often compared to Churchill and
David Lloyd George
for her transformative agenda commonly referred to as "
Thatcherism
". She was
Leader of the Conservative Party
from 1975 to 1990, and Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. She was often called the "Iron Lady" for her uncompromising politics and leadership style.
[1]
Political analyst
Dennis Kavanagh
concludes that the "Thatcher Government produced such a large number of far-reaching changes across much of the policy spectrum, that it passes 'reasonable' criteria of effectiveness, radicalism, and innovation".
[2]
The Labour Party under
James Callaghan
(1976-79) contested the
1979 general election
as unemployment passed the 1,000,000 mark and trade unions became more aggressive. The Conservatives used a highly effective poster created by advertisers
Saatchi & Saatchi
, showing an unemployment queue snaking into the distance, carrying the caption "Labour isn't working". The Conservatives received 43.9% of the vote and 339 seats to Labour's 269, for an overall majority of 44 seats at the 1979 general election. Labour was weakened by the steady long-term decline in the proportion of manual workers in the electorate. Twice as many manual workers normally voted Labour as voted Conservative, but they now constituted only 56% of the electorate. When the Labour Party led by
Harold Wilson
narrowly won the 1964 general election, manual workers had accounted for 63%. Furthermore, they were beginning to turn against the trade unions - alienated, perhaps, by the difficulties of the winter of 1978-9. In contrast, Conservative policies stressed wider home ownership, which Labour refused to match. Thatcher did best in districts where the economy was relatively strong and was weaker where it was contracting.

Thatcherism
[
edit
]
Main article:
Thatcherism
As Prime Minister, she implemented policies focused on
economic liberalism
, using
populism
, and pragmatism, known as
Thatcherism
.
[4]
Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the
Winter of Discontent
and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised
deregulation
(particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of
state-owned companies
and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Due to recession and high unemployment, Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned until the beginning of 1982, a few months before the
Falklands War
. The afterglow of her victory at that war produced a resounding victory at the polls. She was
re-elected in 1983 with an increased majority
.
[5]
Privatisation was an enduring legacy of Thatcherism; it was accepted by the future Labour ministry of
Tony Blair
. Her policy was to privatise nationalised corporations (such as telephone and aerospace firms). She sold public housing to tenants, all on favourable terms. The policy developed an important electoral dimension during the second Thatcher government (1983-87). It involved more than denationalisation: wider share ownership was the second plank of the policy.
[6]
Thatcher advocated an "enterprise society" in Britain, especially in widespread share-ownership, personal ownership of council houses, the marginalisation of trade unions and the expansion of private healthcare. These policies transformed many aspects of British society.
[7]
Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in
1987
, although Labour made gains under the new leadership of
Neil Kinnock
compared to their landslide defeat at the previous election. During this period, her support for a
Community Charge
(popularly referred to as the "poll tax") was widely unpopular (especially in Scotland where the tax was enforced one year earlier than the rest of the country) and her negative views on the
European Community
were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She lost support from Conservative MPs and resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party in November 1990.
Cultural movements
[
edit
]
Environmentalism  as a major public issue was brought to the forefront by Thatcher in 1988, when she included a manifesto warning about climate change.
[8]
The
environmentalism
movements of the 1980s reduced the emphasis on
intensive farming
, and promoted
organic farming
and
conservation
of the countryside.
[9]
[10]
Protestant religious observance declined notably in Britain during the second half of the twentieth century. Catholicism (based on the Irish elements) held its own, while
Islam
grew rapidly due to immigration from Asia and the Middle East as well as higher birth rates from that sector of the general population.
Church of England
attendance particularly dropped, although
charismatic
churches like
Elim
and
AOG
grew. The movement to
Keep Sunday Special
seemed to have lost at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
[11]
LGBT rights under Thatcher
[

Main article:
Timeline of LGBT history in the United Kingdom
Although "homosexual acts" had been partially decriminalised for consenting men over the age of 21 in
England and Wales
in 1967 (
Sexual Offences Act 1967
), it was not until the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980
that the same happened in
Scotland
.
[12]
That same year, the documentary
A Change of Sex
aired on
BBC2
, which enabled viewers to follow the social and medical transition of
Julia Grant
, and provided a snapshot of the Gender Identity Clinic at
Charing Cross Hospital
in London.
[13]
The Self Help Association for Transsexuals (SHAFT) was also formed as an information collecting and disseminating body for
transgender
people,
[14]
The first Black Gay and Lesbian Group was formed in the UK.
[15]
and
Lionel Blue
became the first British rabbi to come out as gay.
[16]
The UK's first television series specifically aimed at a gay audience was broadcast on
London Weekend Television
, called
Gay Life
.
[17]
In 1981, the
European Court of Human Rights
in
Dudgeon v. United Kingdom
struck down
Northern Ireland
's criminalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults the
Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982
later partially decriminalised "homosexual acts" in
Northern Ireland
.
[12]
[18]
The next year,
Chris Smith
, says: "My name is Chris Smith. I'm the
Labour
MP for
Islington South and Finsbury
, and I'm gay", making him the first openly out gay politician in the UK parliament.
[19]
The Politics of Bisexuality
conference in 1984 signaled the growth of separate bisexual community organising.
Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners
, a campaign of LGBT support for striking workers in the
miners' strike
of 1984 and 1985, was launched. In 1988,
Princess Margaret
opened the UK's first residential support centre for people living with
HIV
and
AIDS
in London at London Lighthouse.
[20]
In July 1990, following the murders in a short period of time, of four gay men, hundreds of lesbians and gay men marched from the park where Boothe had been killed to
Ealing Town Hall
and held a candlelit vigil.
[21]
The demonstration led to the formation of
OutRage
, who called for the police to start protecting gay men instead of arresting them. In September, lesbian and gay police officers established the
Lesbian and Gay Police Association
(Lagpa/GPA).
[21]
The first
gay pride
event was held in Manchester.
Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit

AIDS
[

The first UK case of
AIDS
was recorded when a 49-year-old man was admitted to
Brompton Hospital
in London suffering from PCP (
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
). He died ten days later.
[23]
Terry Higgins
died of
AIDS
in
St Thomas' Hospital
London, and his friends and partner Martyn Butler set up the Terry Higgins Trust (which became the
Terrence Higgins Trust
), the first UK AIDS charity.
[24]
In 1983, Britain reported 17 cases of AIDS;
[25]
gay men were asked not to donate blood.
[26]
The next year, Britain reported 108 cases of AIDS with 46 deaths from the disease.
[27]
In 1985, AIDS hysteria grew in the UK when passengers on the
Queen Elizabeth 2
curtailed their holiday after a person with AIDS was discovered on board.
Cunard

A London support group Body Positive was set up that year as a self-help group for people affected by
HTLV-3

[29]
Health Minister

Kenneth Clarke
, enacted powers to detain people with AIDS in hospital against their will, potentially preventing people coming forward for treatment.
[30]
In 1987, the first UK specialist

ward was opened by
Diana, Princess of Wales
; at the opening she made a point of not wearing protective gloves or a mask when she shook hands with the patients.
[31]
AZT
, the first HIV drug to show promise of suppressing the disease was made available in the UK for the first time.
[32]
Section 28
[
edit
]
In 1987, Thatcher said at the Conservative Party conference: "Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay". Backbench Conservative MPs and Peers had already begun a backlash against the promotion of homosexuality and, in December 1987,
Clause 28
was introduced into a bill on local governance by
Dame Jill Knight
,
Conservative
MP for
Birmingham Edgbaston
.
[33]
In 1988, Section 28 of the
Local Government Act 1988
enacted as an amendment to the United Kingdom's Local Government Act 1986, on 24 May 1988 stated that a
local authority
"shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality" or "promote the teaching in any
maintained school
of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship".
[34]
Almost identical legislation was enacted for Scotland by the Westminster Parliament.
Sir Ian McKellen
came out
on
BBC Radio 3
[35]
in response to the governments proposed
Section 28
in the
British Parliament
.
[36]
McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them the
gay
author
Armistead Maupin
. In 1989, the campaign group
Stonewall UK
was set up to oppose Section 28 and other barriers to equality.
[37]
Economic change
[
edit
]
Household prosperity
[
edit
]
From 1964 to 1996, income per head doubled, while ownership of various household goods significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer.
[38]
In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties that lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders and 47% had microwave ovens. Holiday entitlements became more generous. In 1990, nine out of ten full-time manual workers were entitled to more than four weeks of paid holiday a year, while twenty years previously; only two-thirds had been allowed three weeks or more.
[39]
The post-war period also witnessed significant improvements in housing conditions. In 1960, 14% of British households had no indoor toilet, while in 1967; 22% of all homes had no basic hot water supply. By the 1990s, however almost all homes had these amenities together with central heating.

Troubles of 1970s and after
[

Deindustrialisation
[
edit
]
Further information:
Deindustrialisation by country § United Kingdom
After 1973 Britain experienced considerable
deindustrialisation
, especially in both heavy industry (such as mining and steel) and light manufacturing. New jobs appeared with either low wages, or with high skill requirements that the laid-off workers lacked.
[40]
[41]
Jim Tomlinson agrees that deindustrialisation is a major phenomenon but argues that it represents a stepping stone in the country's economic development rather than decline or failure.
[42]
After 1960, British industries were troubled, a phenomenon sometimes known as the "
British Disease
". The railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply and the automotive industry practically disappeared, apart from some luxury models. Deindustrialisation meant the closure of many operations in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs.
[43]
A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with newer businesses replacing older ones. However, the 1970s were different, with a worldwide energy crisis and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia leading to more closures and fewer openings. Major sectors were hit hard between 1966 and 1982, with a 60% decline in textiles, 53% in metal manufacture, 43% in mining, 38% in construction, and 35% in vehicles.
[44]
Coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared in the 21st century. The consumption of coal, mostly for electricity—fell from 157,000,000 tonnes in 1970 to 37,000,000 tonnes in 2015, nearly all of it imported. Coal mining jobs fell from a peak of 1,191,000 in 1920 to 695,000 in 1956, 247,000 in 1976, 44,000 in 1993 to 2,000 in 2015.
[45]
In the 1970s, manufacturing accounted for 25% of the economy. Total employment in manufacturing fell from 7.1 million in 1979 to 4.5 million in 1992 and only 2.7 million in 2016, when it accounted for 10% of the economy.
[46]
[47]
In Scotland, deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or completely closed. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace them.
[48]
[49]
In 1954, Scottish shipyards built 12% of the world's tonnage, falling to 1% in 1968.
[50]
North Sea oil
created a major new industry after 1970, and some older firms successfully took advantage of the opportunity.
John Brown & Company
's shipyard at Clydebank transformed itself from a traditional shipbuilding business to a factor in the high technology offshore oil and gas drilling industry.
[51]
Popular response varied.
[52]
[53]
According to economic sociologist Jacqueline O'Reilly, the political reverberations of deindustrialisation contributed towards a rise in support for
UKIP
among voters in former industrial areas, and eventually came to a head in the vote in favour of
the UK leaving the EU
at the
EU referendum
on 23 June 2016.
[54]
Historian
Tom Devine
has argued that the experience of deindustrialisation had a particular impact on trust in the Conservative party among residents of Scotland and pushed political attitudes in a more left-wing,
economically interventionist
direction contributing to support for Scottish Independence in the 21st Century.
[55]
Economic policies and patterns in the 1980s and 1990s
[
edit
]
Thatcher's deregulation of the economy ended the post-war consensus about the planned economy. She was elected during a period of crises between the Labour Party and the trade unions, and an increasing trend of higher unemployment and deindustrialisation. She
liberalised the City of London
and privatised state-owned enterprises. Inflation fell and trade union influence was significantly reduced.
The
National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) had for a long time, been one of the strongest trade unions. Its strikes had toppled the Heath ministry at the
February 1974 general election
. Thatcher drew the line and defeated it at the bitterly fought
miners' strike of 1984-1985
. The basic problem was that the easy coal had all been mined and what was left was expensive and uneconomical.
[
citation needed
]
The miners were fighting not just for higher wages; but for a way of life that, to continue, had to be subsidised by other workers. The Union split. In the end, almost all the coal mines were shut down. Britain turned to its vast reserves of
North Sea
gas and oil, which brought in substantial tax and export revenues, to fuel a new economic boom.
[
citation needed
]
After the economic boom of the 1980s, a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992, mostly under the ministry of
John Major
; who succeeded Thatcher as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in November 1990. The pound was ejected from the
Exchange Rate Mechanism
on
Black Wednesday
in September 1992, an event which was humiliating for the Conservative government but which helped boost the recovery.
The rest of the 1990s saw a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over sixteen years and was greatly expanded under Blair's
New Labour
government following his landslide election victory at 1997 general election, with a rejuvenated Labour Party abandoning its commitment to old policies like nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms. Many traditional Labour supporters were unhappy with Blair abandoning
socialism
and the restructuring of Clause IV in 1995; effectively tearing up the constitution which had put socialist values and common ownership of industry at the heart of party policy for nearly eighty years. Blair promoted the Labour Party as "
New Labour
", a social democratic centrist party for the 21st century which promised to inject new life into Britain; with investment in education made a key priority.

Since 1997
[

Tony Blair and New Labour
[
edit
]
During the 1990s, The Labour Party, Britain's main left-leaning political party, rebranded itself 'New Labour' before achieving a landslide victory in the 1997 general election and governing on a broadly centrist programme for 13 years.

Tony Blair
became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1994, and served as Prime Minister from 1997 to 2007. With
Gordon Brown
, he founded the movement known as New Labour. In domestic policy, Blair sought to modernise Britain's public services, encourage enterprise and innovation in its private sector and keep the economy open to international commerce. The Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh devolutions took place under his premiership.
[56]
Kavanagh argues that by the 1980s, left-wing or socialist tendencies in the Labour Party divided the party and united its enemies:
Labour voters are not attracted by many "socialist" policies, that is greater public ownership, comprehensive education, extending trade union rights, and redistribution. Such policies appear to unite supporters of other parties in rejection well serving to divide Labour voters.
[57]
Blair moved the Labour Party in new directions, minimising the left-wing or socialist factions. He thereby broadened the appeal to professionals and middle-class voters in "
Middle England
", who had traditionally voted Conservative.
Blair was also anxious to escape from the Labour Party's reputation for "tax-and-spend" domestic policies; he wanted instead to establish a reputation for fiscal prudence. He had undertaken in general terms measures to modernise the welfare state, but he had avoided undertaking measures to reduce poverty, achieve full employment, or reverse the increase in inequality that had occurred during the Thatcher years. Once in office, however, his government launched a package of social policies designed to reduce unemployment and poverty. The commitment to modernise the welfare state was tackled by the introduction of "welfare to work" programmes
[58]
[59]
to motivate the unemployed to return to work instead of drawing benefit. Poverty reduction programmes were targeted at specific groups, including children and the elderly, and took the form of what were termed "New Deals".
[60]
There were also new Tax Credit allowances for low-income and single-parent families with children, and "Sure Start" programmes for under-fours in deprived areas. A "National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal"
[61]
was launched in 2001 with the objective of ensuring that "within 10 to 20 years no-one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live"; a "Social Exclusion Unit"
[
citation needed
]
was set up, and annual progress reports concerning the reduction of poverty and social exclusion were commissioned.
[62]
[63]
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown
replaced Blair as
Prime Minister in 2007
. Labour's popularity declined further with the onset of a
worldwide recession in 2008
, where the Conservatives led by
David Cameron
overtook Labour in the polls for the first time in many years. In Scotland, the
SNP
and
Lib Dems
managed to win seats from Labour at by-elections in a further blow to the government. Arguably, the controversial decision for the UK to support the
invasion of Iraq in 2003
sparked the beginning of Labour's decline in popularity; as their majority was significantly reduced at the
2005 general election
. Five years later, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the
2010 general election
, the party's biggest loss of seats at a single general election since
1931
. On 11 May 2010, Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by
David Cameron
of the Conservative Party, and resigned as Leader of the Labour Party on the same day after nearly three years.
[64]
[65]
The 2010 election was seen as marking the end of the "New Labour" era both in the country at large and the Labour Party with all candidates in the
subsequent leadership election
keen to separate themselves from the movement.
[66]
Ed Miliband
was elected as the new Labour leader on 25 September.

The economic damage done by the
Great Recession
weakened Labour's image and facilitated a Conservative comeback after thirteen years in opposition. Since his election as Conservative Party leader in 2005,
David Cameron
sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position; as opposed to the socially conservative values the party traditionally advocated. The
2010 general election
resulted in a hung parliament, the first in 36 years; and led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a
coalition government
with the centrist
Liberal Democrats
. His premiership was marked by the ongoing negative economic effects of the
late 2000s worldwide financial crisis
. He faced a large deficit in government finances that he sought to reduce through austerity measures. His government introduced large-scale changes to
welfare
,
immigration policy
,
education
, and
healthcare
.
[68]
Cameron's government privatised the
Royal Mail
and some other state assets, and legalised
same-sex marriage
in July 2013. He was
re-elected in 2015
, with 330 seats in the House of Commons; enabling him to form a majority government. This result was unexpected, as another hung parliament was predicted by most major polls. Cameron formed the first Conservative majority government since
1992
, while Labour lost nearly all its Scottish seats to the SNP in the aftermath of the
Scottish independence referendum
and Miliband resigned as party leader. This unexpected result gave the governing Conservatives a mandate to
renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership of the European Union
during the autumn and winter of 2015-16 which was concluded in February 2016 and was then followed by a national referendum on the United Kingdom's continued membership to the European Union itself which was held on 23 June 2016.
The UK's relationship with the EU dominated British political debate in the second half of the 2010s.
On the morning of Friday 24 June 2016, when the results of the EU referendum were announced, Cameron announced his intention to step down as Prime Minister and Leader of Conservative Party at the Conservative Party conference in the autumn of that year following the British electorate's
vote to Leave the European Union in a nationwide referendum
; his government having campaigned for a "Remain" vote. He resigned earlier than intended on 13 July 2016, and was succeeded by former Home Secretary
Theresa May
, who called
another general election
for 8 June 2017, resulting in a hung parliament. The Labour Party, now under the leadership of
Jeremy Corbyn
, made a net gain of seats for the first time in 20 years, and 30 new seats were gained by Labour overall; 6 of which were in Scotland. Notably,
Canterbury
and
Kensington
had never returned Labour MPs to Parliament before, but both were narrowly gained at the expense of the Conservative Party. There was a 9.6% swing from Conservative to Labour, which was the largest swing from one party to another since
1945
.

The
Liberal Democrat
's former party leader and Deputy Prime Minister
Nick Clegg
lost his
Sheffield Hallam
seat to Labour, and former Secretary of State for Business Sir
Vince Cable
regained the Twickenham seat from the Conservatives two years previously. Cable succeeded
Tim Farron
as Lib Dem leader after the election, and three new seats were gained for the party in Scotland. As predicted,
[
by whom?
]
UKIP led by
Paul Nuttall
made no gains and lost the majority of its previous supporters to the Labour and Conservative parties; signifying an end to multi-party politics and a return to two-party politics. Nuttall stood at
Boston and Skegness
, which was the constituency with the highest vote to leave the EU at the referendum. However, Nuttall finished in third place and resigned as UKIP leader. The Conservatives remained in power and
Theresa May
remained as Prime Minister through a confidence and supply agreement made with the Northern Irish
Democratic Unionist Party
.
The next couple of years were defined by political instability as the government attempted to conduct the process of withdrawing the United Kingdom from the EU in the context of a hung parliament. Both
Theresa May
and her successor
Boris Johnson
failed to reach a consensus in Parliament for leaving the EU in a way they wished, eventually resulting in another
general election
in late 2019. At this election, the Conservatives made a net gain of 48 seats and were returned with the largest majority for a governing party since
2001
in what was regarded as a landslide victory, winning 43.6% of the vote (the highest share for any party since
1979
) and 365 seats (the highest number for the party since
1987
). Labour made a net loss of 60 seats, losing several of its constituencies in northern England, across the Midlands and Wales to the Conservatives in what was widely referred to as a collapse of the
Red Wall
.

The SNP made a net gain of 13 seats across Scotland, winning 45% of the Scottish vote and 48 of the 59 Scottish seats. In Northern Ireland, more Irish Nationalist MPs were elected than British Unionists for the first time, although unionist parties still won more votes.

Early in 2020, the
coronavirus pandemic
spread to the United Kingdom.
[76]
The attempt to combat the disease led to disruptions in everyday life on a scale not seen since World War II, including closures of
schools and other educational institutions
, shops selling non-essential goods and most public facilities for eating, entertainment and leisure, as well as cancellations of events and restrictions on people's rights to gather in public places and leave their homes.

Aftermath of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum
Economic and social issues caused political unrest, particularly in areas hurt by deindustrialization and globalization of the economy. The
UK Independence Party
(UKIP), a
Eurosceptic
political party, was founded in 1993. It rose to prominence after 2000, winning third place in the
2004 European elections
, second place in the
2009 European elections
and first place in the
2014 European elections
, with 27.5% of the total vote.

The 'Leave' pro-Brexit campaign focused strongly on sovereignty and the need to control migration, whereas the 'Remain' campaign focused on the negative economic impacts of leaving the EU.
[83]
Polls showed more cited both the EU (32%) and migration (48%) as important issues than cited the economy (27%).
[84]
By 2018 as the complexities of leaving the EU dominated political discussions, economists produced gloomy projections of the damage to the British economy.

Diana, Princess of Wales
[
edit
]
Diana, Princess of Wales
was married to
Prince Charles
from 1981 to 1996. She died in a
car accident in 1997
.
During the summer of 1981, the nation's spirits were raised by the
wedding
of
Prince Charles
and
Lady Diana Spencer
.
[86]
The ceremony reached a global TV audience of 750 million people. It restored the royal family to the headlines where they would become a permanent fixture in tabloids and celebrity gossip publications, as well as a major tourist attraction. Diana became what
Tony Blair
later called the "People's Princess", an iconic national figure, rivalling or surpassing the Queen, until her divorce.
Her accidental death
brought an unprecedented spasm of grief and mourning.
[87]
Her brother, the
9th Earl Spencer
, captured her role:
Diana was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty. All over the world she was a symbol of selfless humanity. All over the world, a standard bearer for the rights of the truly downtrodden, a very British girl who transcended nationality. Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic.

Secularisation

Further information:
History of Christianity in Britain
Brian Harrison
reports that the forces of secularisation grew rapidly, and by the 1990s Britain was an unusually secular society by the standards of Western Europe. Standing at the lower end of attendance at religious services, and near the top in people claiming "no religion". While 80% of Britons in 1950 said they were Christians, only 64% did so in 2000. Harrison states:
By every measure (number of churches, number of parish clergy, church attendance, Easter Day communicants, number of church marriages, membership as a proportion of the adult population) the Church of England was in decline after 1970. In 1985 there were only half as many parish clergy as in 1900.
[89]
Roman Catholicism held up, thanks initially to immigration from Ireland and later from Poland.
[90]
What had been tiny clusters of Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists grew enormously through immigration.
Research conducted by the polling organisation
YouGov
in 2020 suggested that whilst a majority of Britons described the UK as a Christian country and most celebrated the traditionally Christian festivals of
Christmas
and
Easter
, 55% said they did not belong to any religion. However, this poll did not include any residents of Northern Ireland, which is generally considered the
most religious
part of the UK.

attributes the growth to "recent immigration, the growing birth rate, some conversion to Islam, and perhaps also an increased willingness to self-identify as 'Muslim' on account of the 'war on terror

Association football in Northern Ireland
Throughout this period association football, generally referred to as football, was the most popular sport in the UK. The four nations of the UK retained the separate national teams and league systems that they had had since the early days of the sport's codification.
The rise of football hooliganism, which had started to come to prominence in the 1970s, continued to mar the game into the 1980s and reached a nadir in the
Heysel Stadium disaster
, when Liverpool fans hooliganism, combined with poor policing and infrastructure, led to the deaths of 39 Juventus fans before the
European Cup final
, in May 1985. This resulted in English clubs being banned from European competitions for five years. Welsh clubs playing in the
English league system
, who could qualify for the
European Cup Winners' Cup
via the
Welsh Cup
, were unaffected by the ban, as were clubs from Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Attendances at professional matches dropped during the beginning of this period, with blame pointed not only at increasing hooliganism, but also the deteriorating state of many stadiums.
[

Despite the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
being published in 1973, following the
1971 Ibrox disaster
, safety standards at many football grounds were poor, culminating in the
Bradford City stadium fire
in 1985 and the
Hillsborough disaster
in 1989, in which 56 and 96 people, respectively, were killed as a consequence of poor stadium safety. Recommendations from the subsequent
Taylor Report
were acted upon, and eventually all top-flight stadiums in England, Scotland, and Wales became
all-seated
.
The structure of league football in England was radically altered in 1992 when the clubs of the Football League First Division resigned en masse in 1992 to form the Premier League, which became the new top division in England.
[96]
The new league assigned TV rights to Sky TV as a revenue-raising exercise, which  was a relatively new concept in the UK. These domestic rights issues were followed in time with a succession of international rights packages and the Premier League became the most watched football league in the world. In Scotland, a similar split occurred in 1998 when the Scottish Premier Division split to form the
Scottish Premier League
.  It was abolished in 2013, when it re-merged with the Scottish Football League merged to form the
Scottish Professional Football League
.
[97]
Prior to 1992 there was no national league in Wales, just a cup competition, and many of the nation's best clubs played in the English league system. The
League of Wales
was formed to remedy this and, as of 2020 and renamed Cymru Premier, is now the top division of a full
national league system
.   In 2003, the
Irish Football Association
took direct charge of Northern Ireland's top flight with the creation of the
Irish Premier League
, splitting from the
Irish Football League
.

Other sports
[
edit
]
Cricket is England's other historic sport, but it grew faster in popularity in the overseas colonies, and immigrants in increasing numbers comprised the ranks of top players and fan base.
[98]
Tennis spread from upper-class estates into tennis clubs in middle-class suburbs, where it became a woman's specialty.
[99]
Women increasingly frequented gyms, which sprang up everywhere; by the mid-1990s, one in six members were women.
[100]
Middle-class men and women were usually more active than working-class people were. Scotland, the birthplace of golf, remains the top destination for the sport; many clubs opened up by 1910 and continue to operate to the present day. The total number of golfers reached the 2.5 million mark by 2000.
[101]
Immigration was often a topic of great controversy and debate in the early 21st century and widely considered to be one of the main contributing factors to the UK's 2016 vote to leave the EU.
[102]
Immigration
[
edit
]
Main article:
Modern immigration to the United Kingdom
Whilst in the second half of the 20th century most immigrants to the UK arrived from the former British empire in the early 21st century large numbers arrived from Europe and the Middle East.
[103]
The UK population was recorded as 56,267,000 people in 1996, out of which 52,942,000 were White. The other 3,307,000 represented diverse ethnic or racial origins: 875,000 were Black; 1,639,000 were Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi; 126,000 were Chinese; 161,000 were Other Asian; 506,000 were from other groups or were of mixed-race origin.
[104]
Some immigrants came to the UK as
asylum seekers
, seeking protection as
refugees
under the United Nations
1951 Refugee Convention
, or from
member states of the European Union
, exercising one of the European Union's
Four Freedoms
. Since the 1980s, however, the UK has become a leading proponent of European restrictionalism and has developed policies that tend to exclude asylum seekers from mainstream society. Dispersal policy was set up through the National Asylum Support Service programme so that asylum seekers were directed to urban areas that had available housing, although possibly because of a weak job market. While newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees had both skills and qualifications, they experienced high levels of unemployment, or else found mostly low-skilled jobs with low pay. Public opinion in host areas turned against them.
[105]
[106]
Devolution
[
edit
]
Main article:
Devolution in the United Kingdom
On 11 September 1997 (the seven-hundredth anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the
Battle of Stirling Bridge
) a
referendum
was held on devolving substantial power to a
Scottish Parliament
.
[107]
Voters overwhelmingly voted to establish a Scottish parliament and grant it limited taxation powers. Two weeks later, a
referendum
on establishing a
Welsh Assembly
was also approved, by a narrow majority. The first elections were held, and these bodies began to operate, in 1999. Devolution was reintroduced to Northern Ireland at a similar time via the
Good Friday agreement
.
[56]
The creation of these bodies widened geographic differences, especially in areas such as
healthcare
.
[108]
[109]
New Labour also began a programme of devolution in England creating a
London Mayorship
and
Assembly
via
referendums
in 1998 and passing the
Local Government Act 2000
which allowed English and Welsh local government's to hold referendums on introducing
directly elected mayors
in their areas.
[110]
[111]
Though the Conservatives had historically been considered more critical of devolution than their Labour counterparts, this process continued after their return to government in 2010.

Features
[
edit
]
The game features
steam
,
diesel
and
electric
traction trains; keyboard, mouse or gamepad control of throttles, brakes and switches with Simple and Expert driving models for varying player skills. A variety of scenarios are available for Standard and Career modes, as well as an exploratory style Free Roam mode. Quick Drive mode allows a player to pick a train (or to put together their own by snapping together cars), choose a route, set departure and destination stations and decide on the time of day, the season and the weather. Cargo and passengers are animated, and weather changes dynamically with time. Steam Workshop allows players to upload and download additional user-created routes and scenarios.
Editing tools
[
edit
]
A complete suite of tools is also available to create custom content. This allows players to create their own custom routes and scenarios with the in-game editor, or to create custom rolling stock and other 3D assets that can be imported in game via the Blueprint Editor. The route editor has the ability to import
Digital Elevation Model
data (DEM) to shape the terrain and has a built in Google Maps overlay. These two tools massively simplify creation of real world routes. Track laying is spline-based, giving almost unlimited freedom over the track shape. The scenario editor lets players create their own custom scenario, with a defined set of instruction, like having to make passenger stops, shunting and various other tasks. Scenarios can also have scripting, making simulation of possible failures and other unexpected events possible. The Blueprint Editor lets creators import their models and textures into the game. With this tool, creators can import pretty much anything in the game, like custom skyboxes, ground textures, track, roads, vegetation, buildings, track linked object (like signals) and various other scenery assets, and of course rolling stock too.
Downloadable content

Various add-ons are available for
Train Simulator
, containing routes and rolling stock units for Quick Drive use, as well as scenarios for Standard, Career and Free Roam modes.
[24]
Add-ons directly created by Dovetail Games can be found on Steam as DLC. The game is infamous for the sheer amount of DLC available on Steam, costing over $10,000 in its entirety.

IGN
gave
RailWorks
a seven out of ten, or "good", stating that the game "doesn't bring a lot of new stuff to the genre" and graphically "lacks the high-end flair of today's top-level titles".
[26]
On 17 March 2011, it was announced that
RailWorks 2
had won the award for Simulation of the Year 2010 by readers of

Amok
(subtitled "II Gigante Mascherato", "the Masked Giant") is an
Italian comic book
series created by
Cesare Solini
and
Antonio Canale
.
Background
[
edit
]
The comics started its publications in October 1946, published by
Agostino della Casa
; the authors, writer Cesare Solini and artist Antonio Canale, signed the comics with the pen names Phil Anderson and Tony Chan.
[1]
Inspired by
the Phantom
, it features an
Indonesian
giant man, born on the
Java island
, that becomes a masked crimefighter after the kidnapping of his girlfriend.
[1]
[2]
Despite the success obtained, Amok ended its publications in 1948; over the years it was reprinted several times.
[1]
The series was also published in several foreign countries.
[1]
In Sweden, the comic was renamed Kilroy when it was first published in 1948. The name was inspired by the popular graffiti phrase
Kilroy was here
. It was such a success in Sweden that new stories were produced directly for the Swedish market (by artists
Rolf Gohs
and
Francisco Cueto
) and it was published until the 1970s.

US laws on fair pay and conditions, unions, democracy, equality and security at work
The
Statue of Liberty
greeted millions of
people who migrated
to America for
work
, saying "
Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...
" In 2013, in a 155.5 million
working population
, union membership was 35.9% in the public sector, 6.6% in the private sector.
[1]
In 2017, unemployment was 4.3%, excluding people in prison. The US ranks 28th in the world
inequality-adjusted
human development index
.
[2]
The rights and duties for employees,
labor unions
, and
employers
are set by
labor law
in the United States. Labor law's basic aim is to remedy the "
inequality of bargaining power
" between employees and employers, especially employers "organized in the
corporate
or other forms of ownership association".
[3]
Over the 20th century, federal law created minimum
social and economic rights
, and encouraged state laws to go beyond the minimum to favor employees.
[4]
The
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
requires a federal
minimum wage
, currently $7.25 but higher in 29 states and D.C., and discourages working weeks over 40 hours through time-and-a-half
overtime pay
. There are no federal laws, and few state laws, requiring
paid holidays
or
paid family leave
. The
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
creates a limited right to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in larger employers. There is no automatic right to an occupational pension beyond federally guaranteed
Social Security
,
[5]
but the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
requires standards of prudent management and good governance if employers agree to provide pensions, health plans or other benefits. The
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970
requires employees have a safe system of work.
A
contract of employment
can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights. But to increase their
bargaining power
to get better terms, employees organize labor unions for
collective bargaining
. The
Clayton Act of 1914
guarantees all people the right to organize,
[6]
and the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through
unfair labor practices
. Under the
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959
, labor union governance follows democratic principles. If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities have a duty to bargain in
good faith
. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing influence through pension funds,
[7]
and representation on
corporate
boards.
[8]
Since the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
, all employing entities and labor unions have a duty to treat employees equally, without discrimination based on "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin".
[9]
There are separate rules for sex discrimination in pay under the
Equal Pay Act of 1963
. Additional groups with "protected status" were added by the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
. There is no federal law banning all sexual orientation or
identity
discrimination, but 22 states had passed laws by 2016. These equality laws generally prevent discrimination in hiring and terms of employment, and make discharge because of a protected characteristic unlawful. In 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in
Bostock v. Clayton County
that discrimination solely on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There is no federal law against
unjust discharge
, and most states also have no law with full protection against wrongful
termination of employment
.
[10]
Collective agreements
made by labor unions and some individual contracts require that people are only discharged for a "
just cause
". The
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
requires employing entities give 60 days notice if more than 50 or one third of the workforce may lose their jobs. Federal law has aimed to reach
full employment
through
monetary policy
and spending on infrastructure. Trade policy has attempted to put labor rights in international agreements, to ensure open markets in a
global economy
do not undermine
fair
and
full employment
.
History
[
edit

Main articles:
History of labor law in the United States
and
Labor history of the United States
After the
Declaration of Independence
,
slavery in the US
was progressively abolished in the north, but only finished by the
13th Amendment
in 1865 near the end of the
American Civil War
.
Modern US labor law mostly comes from statutes passed between
1935
and
1974
, and changing interpretations of the
US Supreme Court
.
[11]
However, laws regulated the rights of people at work and employers from colonial times on. Before the
Declaration of Independence
in 1776, the
common law
was either uncertain or hostile to labor rights.
[12]
Unions were classed as conspiracies, and potentially criminal.
[13]
It tolerated
slavery
and
indentured servitude
. From the
Pequot War
in
Connecticut
from 1636 onwards,
Native Americans
were enslaved
by European settlers. More than half of the European immigrants arrived as prisoners, or in
indentured servitude
,
[14]
where they were not free to leave their employers until a
debt bond
had been repaid. Until its abolition, the
Atlantic slave trade
brought millions of Africans to do forced labor in the Americas.
However, in 1772, the English
Court of King's Bench
held in
Somerset v Stewart
that slavery was to be presumed unlawful at common law.
[15]
Charles Stewart
from
Boston
,
Massachusetts
had bought
James Somerset
as a slave and taken him to
England
. With the help of
abolitionists
, Somerset escaped and sued for a writ of
habeas corpus
(that "holding his body" had been unlawful).
Lord Mansfield
, after declaring he should "
let justice be done whatever be the consequence
", held that slavery was "so odious" that nobody could take "a slave by force to be sold" for any "reason whatever". This was a major grievance of southern slave owning states, leading up to the
American Revolution
in 1776.
[16]
The
1790 United States census
recorded 694,280 slaves (17.8 per cent) of a total 3,893,635 population. After independence, the
British Empire
halted the
Atlantic slave trade
in
1807
,
[17]
and abolished slavery in its own territories, by paying off slave owners in
1833
.
[18]
In the US, northern states progressively abolished slavery. However, southern states did not. In
Dred Scott v. Sandford
the Supreme Court held the federal government could not regulate slavery, and also that people who were slaves had no legal rights in court.
[19]
The
American Civil War
was the result.
President Lincoln
's
Emancipation Proclamation
in 1863 made abolition of slavery a war aim, and the
Thirteenth Amendment
of 1865 enshrined the abolition of most forms of slavery in the Constitution. Former slave owners were further prevented from holding people in involuntary servitude for debt by the
Peonage Act of 1867
.
[20]
In 1868, the
Fourteenth Amendment
ensured equal access to justice, and the
Fifteenth Amendment
required that everyone would have the right to vote. The
Civil Rights Act of 1875
was also meant to ensure equality in access to housing and transport, but in the
Civil Rights Cases
, the Supreme Court found it was "unconstitutional", ensuring that racial segregation would continue. In dissent,
Harlan J
said the majority was leaving people "practically at the mercy of corporations".
[21]
Even if people were formally free, they remained factually dependent on
property
owners for work, income and basic services.
Labor
is prior to and independent of
capital
. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration ... The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from
poverty
; none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a
political power
which they already possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of
liberty
shall be lost.

First Annual Message
(
)
Like slavery, common law repression of labor unions was slow to be undone.
[22]
In 1806,
Commonwealth v. Pullis
held that a
Philadelphia
shoemakers union striking for higher wages was an illegal "conspiracy",
[23]
even though
corporations
—combinations of employers—were lawful. Unions still formed and acted. The first federation of unions, the
National Trades Union
was established in 1834 to achieve a
10 hour working day
, but it did not survive the soaring unemployment from the financial
Panic of 1837
. In 1842,
Commonwealth v. Hunt
, held that
Pullis
was wrong, after the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers' Society struck for higher wages.
[24]
The first instance judge said unions would "render property insecure, and make it the spoil of the multitude, would annihilate property, and involve society in a common ruin". But in the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
,
Shaw CJ
held people "are free to work for whom they please, or not to work, if they so prefer" and could "agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights, in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests." This stopped criminal cases, although civil cases persisted.
[25]
In 1869 an organisation called the
Knights of Labor
was founded by Philadelphia artisans, joined by miners 1874, and urban tradesmen from 1879. It aimed for racial and gender equality, political education and cooperative enterprise,
[26]
yet it supported the
Alien Contract Labor Law
of 1885 which suppressed workers migrating to the US under a contract of employment.
Industrial conflicts on
railroads
and
telegraphs
from 1883 led to the foundation of the
American Federation of Labor
in 1886, with the simple aim of improving workers wages, housing and job security "here and now".
[27]
It also aimed to be the sole federation, to create a strong, unified labor movement. Business reacted with litigation. The
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890
, which was intended to sanction business cartels acting in
restraint of trade
,
[28]
was applied to labor unions. In 1895, the
US Supreme Court
in
In re Debs
affirmed an injunction, based on the Sherman Act, against the striking workers of the
Pullman Company
.  The strike leader
Eugene Debs
was put in prison.
[29]
In notable dissent among the judiciary,
[30]
Holmes J
argued in
Vegelahn v. Guntner
that any union taking
collective action
in
good faith
was lawful: even if strikes caused economic loss, this was equally legitimate as economic loss from corporations competing with one another.
[31]
Holmes J
was elevated to the
US Supreme Court
, but was again in a minority on labor rights. In 1905,
Lochner v. New York
held that
New York
limiting bakers' working day to 60 hours a week violated employers'
freedom of contract
. The Supreme Court majority supposedly unearthed this "right" in the
Fourteenth Amendment
, that no State should "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."
[32]
With
Harlan J
,
Holmes J
dissented, arguing that the "
constitution
is not intended to embody a particular economic theory" but is "made for people of fundamentally differing views". On questions of social and economic policy, courts should never declare legislation "unconstitutional". The Supreme Court, however, accelerated its attack on labor in
Loewe v. Lawlor
, holding that triple damages were payable by a striking union to its employers under the
Sherman Act of 1890
.
[33]
This line of cases was finally quashed by the
Clayton Act of 1914
§6. This removed labor from
antitrust law
, affirming that the "
labor of a human being is not a commodity
or article of commerce" and nothing "in the antitrust laws" would forbid the operation of labor organizations "for the purposes of mutual help".
[34]
In his
State of the Union
address of 1944, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
urged that America develop
Second Bill of Rights
through legislation, including the right to fair employment, an end to unfair competition, to education, health, and social security.
Throughout the early 20th century, states enacted labor rights to advance social and economic progress. But despite the
Clayton Act
, and abuses of employers documented by the
Commission on Industrial Relations
from 1915, the Supreme Court struck labor rights down as unconstitutional, leaving management powers virtually unaccountable.
[35]
In this
Lochner era
, the Courts held that employers could force workers to not belong to labor unions,
[36]
that a minimum wage for women and children was void,
[37]
that states could not ban
employment agencies
charging fees for work,
[38]
that workers could not strike in solidarity with colleagues of other firms,
[39]
and even that the federal government could not ban child labor.
[40]
It also imprisoned socialist activists, who opposed the fighting in
World War I
, meaning that
Eugene Debs
ran as the Socialist Party's candidate for
President
in
1920
from prison.
[41]
Critically, the courts held state and federal attempts to create Social Security to be unconstitutional.
[42]
Because they were unable to save in safe public pensions, millions of people bought shares in corporations, causing massive growth in the
stock market
.
[43]
Because the Supreme Court precluded regulation for good information on what people were buying,
corporate promoters
tricked people into paying more than stocks were really worth. The
Wall Street Crash of 1929
wiped out millions of people's savings. Business lost investment and fired millions of workers. Unemployed people had less to spend with businesses. Business fired more people. There was a downward spiral into the
Great Depression
.
This led to the election of
Franklin D. Roosevelt
for president in 1932, who promised a "
New Deal
". Government committed to create
full employment
and a system of
social and economic rights
enshrined in federal law.
[44]
But despite the
Democratic Party
's overwhelming electoral victory, the Supreme Court continued to strike down legislation, particularly the
National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933
, which regulated enterprise in an attempt to ensure fair wages and prevent
unfair competition
.
[45]
Finally, after Roosevelt's
second overwhelming victory
in 1936, and Roosevelt's threat to create more judicial positions if his laws were not upheld, one Supreme Court judge
switched positions
. In
West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish
the Supreme Court found that
minimum wage
legislation was constitutional,
[46]
letting the
New Deal
go on. In labor law, the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
guaranteed every employee the right to unionize, collectively bargain for fair wages, and take collective action, including
in solidarity
with employees of other firms. The
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
created the right to a minimum wage, and time-and-a-half
overtime
pay if employers asked people to work over 40 hours a week. The
Social Security Act of 1935
gave everyone the right to a basic pension and to receive insurance if they were unemployed, while the
Securities Act of 1933
and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
ensured buyers of securities on the
stock market
had good information. The
Davis-Bacon Act of 1931
and
Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936
required that in federal government contracts, all employers would pay their workers fair wages, beyond the minimum, at prevailing local rates.
[47]
To reach
full employment
and out of depression, the
Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935
enabled the federal government to spend huge sums of money on building and creating jobs. This accelerated as
World War II
began. In 1944, his health waning, Roosevelt urged Congress to work towards a "
Second Bill of Rights
" through legislative action, because "unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world" and "we shall have yielded to the spirit of
Fascism
here at home."
[48]
President
Lyndon B. Johnson
explains the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
as it was signed, to end discrimination and segregation in voting, education, public services, and employment.
Although the
New Deal
had created a minimum safety net of labor rights, and aimed to enable
fair pay
through
collective bargaining
, a Republican dominated Congress revolted when Roosevelt died. Against the veto of
President Truman
, the
Taft-Hartley Act
of 1947 limited the right of labor unions to take
solidarity action
, and enabled states to ban unions requiring all people in a workplace becoming union members. A series of Supreme Court decisions, held the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
not only created minimum standards, but stopped or "
preempted
" states enabling better union rights, even though there was no such provision in the statute.
[49]
Labor unions became extensively regulated by the
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959
. Post-war prosperity had raised people's living standards, but most workers who had no union, or
job security
rights remained vulnerable to unemployment. As well as the crisis triggered by
Brown v. Board of Education
,
[50]
and the need to dismantle segregation, job losses in agriculture, particularly among
African Americans
was a major reason for the
civil rights movement
, culminating in the
March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
led by
Martin Luther King Jr.
Although Roosevelt's
Executive Order 8802
of 1941 had prohibited
racial discrimination
in the national defense industry, people still suffered discrimination because of their
skin color
across other workplaces. Also, despite the increasing numbers of women in work, sex discrimination was endemic. The government of
John F. Kennedy
introduced the
Equal Pay Act of 1963
, requiring equal pay for women and men.
Lyndon B. Johnson
introduced the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
, finally prohibiting discrimination against people for "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Slowly, a new generation of equal rights laws spread. At federal level, this included the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
, the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act
of 1978, and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
, now overseen by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
.
Bernie Sanders
became the most successful
Democratic Socialist
presidential candidate since
Eugene Debs
, winning 22 states and 43.1% of votes in the
2016 Democratic primary
. He co-authored the 2016 Democratic platform,
[51]
before
Hillary Clinton
lost the
electoral college
to
Donald Trump
.
Although people, in limited fields, could claim to be equally treated, the mechanisms for fair pay and treatment were dismantled after the 1970s. The last major labor law statute, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
created rights to well regulated
occupational pensions
, although only where an employer had already promised to provide one: this usually depended on
collective bargaining
by unions. But in 1976, the Supreme Court in
Buckley v. Valeo
held anyone could spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, as a part of the
First Amendment
right to "
freedom of speech
". After the Republican
President Reagan
took office in 1981, he dismissed all
air traffic control staff
who went on strike, and replaced the
National Labor Relations Board
members with pro-management men. Dominated by Republican appointees, the Supreme Court suppressed labor rights, removing rights of professors, religious school teachers, or illegal immigrants to organize in a union,
[52]
allowing employees to be searched at work,
[53]
and eliminating employee rights to sue for medical malpractice in their own health care.
[54]
Only limited statutory changes were made. The
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
criminalized large numbers of migrants. The
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
guaranteed workers some notice before a mass termination of their jobs. The
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
guaranteed a right to 12 weeks leave to take care for children after birth, all unpaid. The
Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996
cut the minimum wage, by enabling employers to take the tips of their staff to subsidize the minimum wage. A series of proposals by Democratic and independent politicians to advance labor rights were not enacted,
[55]
and the United States began to fall behind most other developed countries in labor rights.
[56]
In relation to
federal government contracting
, Executive Order 13673, entitled
Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces
, was issued by President
Barack Obama
on 31 July 2014. It contained "new requirements designed to increase efficiency and cost savings in the Federal contracting process",
[57]
specifically referring to "contracting with responsible sources who comply with labor laws".
[58]
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration published guidance on 25 August 2016.
[57]
The order listed 14 federal laws which were defined as "labor laws", and extended coverage to "equivalent state laws". A breach of any of these laws during the three year period preceding the contract award was treated as non-compliance; for a contract valued over $500,000,
contracting officers
were to consider such violations, and any corrective actions taken by the business concerned, in determining contract award. Similar provisions were built into sub-contracting arrangements. To support compliance, each federal agency was required to appoint a "Labor Compliance Advisor".
[58]
: Sec. 3
The order was revoked by President
Donald Trump
on 27 March 2017 under
Executive Order 13782

Eleanor Roosevelt
believed the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
of 1948 "may well become the international Magna Carta of all". Based on the President's call for a
Second Bill of Rights
in 1944, articles 22-24 elevated rights to "social security", "just and favourable conditions of work", and the "right to rest and leisure" to be as important as the "right to own property".
[60]
Contracts
between employees and employers (mostly
corporations
) usually begin an employment relationship, but are often not enough for a decent livelihood. Because individuals
lack bargaining power
, especially against wealthy corporations, labor law creates legal rights that override arbitrary market outcomes. Historically, the law faithfully enforced property rights and
freedom of contract
on any terms,
[61]
whether or not this was inefficient, exploitative and unjust. In the early 20th century, as more people favored the introduction of democratically determined
economic and social rights
over rights of property and contract, state and federal governments introduced law reform. First, the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
created a minimum wage (now $7.25 at federal level, higher in 28 states) and
overtime pay
of one and a half times. Second, the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
creates very limited rights to take unpaid leave. In practice, good employment contracts improve on these minimums. Third, while there is no right to an
occupational pension
or other benefits, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
ensures employers guarantee those benefits if they are promised. Fourth, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970
demands a safe system of work, backed by professional inspectors. Individual states are often empowered to go beyond the federal minimum, and function as
laboratories of democracy
in social and economic rights, where they have not been constrained by the
US Supreme Court
.

Worker

Employee
, and
Inequality of bargaining power
Common law
, state and federal statutes usually confer labor rights on "employees", but not people who are autonomous and have sufficient
bargaining power
to be "independent contractors". In 1994, the
Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report
recommended a unified definition of an employee under all federal labor laws, to reduce litigation, but this was not implemented. As it stands, Supreme Court cases have stated various general principles, which will apply according to the context and purpose of the statute in question. In
NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc.
,
[62]
newsboys who sold newspapers in Los Angeles claimed that they were "employees", so that they had a right to collectively bargain under the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
. The newspaper corporations argued the newsboys were "independent contractors", and they were under no duty to bargain in
good faith
. The Supreme Court held the newsboys were employees, and common law tests of employment, particularly the summary in the
Restatement of the Law of Agency, Second
§220, were no longer appropriate. They were not "independent contractors" because of the degree of control employers had. But the
National Labor Relations Board
could decide itself who was covered if it had "a reasonable basis in law." Congress reacted, first, by explicitly amending the
NLRA
§2(1) so that independent contractors were exempt from the law while, second, disapproving that the common law was irrelevant. At the same time, the Supreme Court decided
United States v. Silk
,
[63]
holding that "economic reality" must be taken into account when deciding who is an employee under the Social Security Act of 1935. This meant a group of coal loaders were employees, having regard to their economic position, including their
lack of bargaining power
, the degree of discretion and control, and the risk they assumed compared to the coal businesses they worked for. By contrast, the Supreme Court found truckers who owned their own trucks, and provided services to a carrier company, were independent contractors.
[64]
Thus, it is now accepted that multiple factors of traditional common law tests may not be replaced if a statute gives no further definition of "employee" (as is usual, e.g., the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
,
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
,
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
). Alongside the purpose of labor legislation to mitigate inequality of bargaining power and redress the economic reality of a worker's position, the multiple factors found in the
Restatement of Agency
must be considered, though none is necessarily decisive.
[65]
"
Newsboys
" in
L.A.
were held in the leading case,
NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc.
, to be employees with labor rights, not independent contractors, on account of their
unequal bargaining power
.
[66]
Common law
agency tests of who is an "employee" take account of an employer's control, if the employee is in a distinct business, degree of direction, skill, who supplies tools, length of employment, method of payment, the regular business of the employer, what the parties believe, and whether the employer has a business.
[67]
Some statutes also make specific exclusions that reflect the common law, such as for independent contractors, and others make additional exceptions. In particular, the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
§2(11) exempts supervisors with "authority, in the interest of the employer", to exercise discretion over other employees' jobs and terms. This was originally a narrow exception. Controversially, in
NLRB v. Yeshiva University
,
[68]
a 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court held that full time professors in a
university
were excluded from collective bargaining rights, on the theory that they exercised "managerial" discretion in academic matters. The dissenting judges pointed out that management was actually in the hands of university administration, not professors. In
NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc.
,
[69]
the Supreme Court held, again 5 to 4, that six registered nurses who exercised supervisory status over others fell into the "professional" exemption.
Stevens J
, for the dissent, argued that if "the 'supervisor' is construed too broadly", without regard to the Act's purpose, protection "is effectively nullified".
[70]
Similarly, under the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
, in
Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.
,
[71]
the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that a traveling medical salesman for
GSK
of four years was an "outside salesman", and so could not claim overtime. People working unlawfully are often regarded as covered, so as not to encourage employers to exploit vulnerable employees. For instance in
Lemmerman v. A.T. Williams Oil Co.
,
[72]
under the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act an eight-year-old boy was protected as an employee, even though children working under the age of 8 was unlawful. However, in
Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB
,
[73]
the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that an undocumented worker could not claim back pay, after being discharged for organizing in a union. The gradual withdrawal of more and more people from the scope of labor law, by a slim majority of the Supreme Court since 1976, means that the US falls below international law standards, and standards in other democratic countries, on core labor rights, including
freedom of association
.
[74]
In September 2015, the
California Labor and Workforce Development Agency
held that
Uber
drivers are controlled and sanctioned by the company and are therefore not self-employed.
[75]
Common law tests were often important for determining who was, not just an employee, but the relevant employers who had "
vicarious liability
". Potentially there can be multiple, joint-employers could who share responsibility, although responsibility in
tort law
can exist regardless of an employment relationship. In
Ruiz v. Shell Oil Co
,
[76]
the
Fifth Circuit
held that it was relevant which employer had more control, whose work was being performed, whether there were agreements in place, who provided tools, had a right to discharge the employee, or had the obligation to pay.
[77]
In
Local 217, Hotel & Restaurant Employees Union v. MHM Inc
[78]
the question arose under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
whether a subsidiary or parent corporation was responsible to notify employees that the hotel would close. The
Second Circuit
held the subsidiary was the employer, although the trial court had found the parent responsible while noting the subsidiary would be the employer under the
NLRA
. Under the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
, 29 USC §203(r), any "enterprise" that is under common control will count as the employing entity. Other statutes do not explicitly adopt this approach, although the
NLRB
has found an enterprise to be an employer if it has "substantially identical management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers and supervision."
[79]
In
South Prairie Const. Co. v. Local No. 627, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO
,
[80]
the Supreme Court found that the DC Circuit had legitimately identified two corporations as a single employer given that they had a "very substantial qualitative degree of centralized control of labor",
[81]
but that further determination of the relevant bargaining unit should have been remitted to the
NLRB
. When employees are hired through an agency, it is likely that the end-employer will be considered responsible for statutory rights in most cases, although the agency may be regarded as a joint employer.
[82]
Contracts of employment
[
edit
]
See also:
United States contract law
When people start work, there will almost always be a
contract of employment
that governs the relationship of employee and the employing entity (usually a
corporation
, but occasionally a human being).
[83]
A "contract" is an agreement enforceable in law. Very often it can be written down, or signed, but an
oral agreement
is also a fully enforceable contract. Because employees have
unequal bargaining power
compared to almost all employing entities, most employment contracts are "
standard form
".
[84]
Most terms and conditions are photocopied or reproduced for many people. Genuine
negotiation
is rare, unlike in commercial transactions between two business corporations. This has been the main justification for enactment of rights in federal and state law. The federal right to
collective bargaining
, by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make
collective agreements
.
[85]
The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased
overtime
pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a "minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers", even when a person could not get a high enough wage by individual bargaining.
[86]
These and other rights, including
family leave
, rights against
discrimination
, or basic
job security
standards, were designed by the
United States Congress
and state legislatures to replace individual contract provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights. For example, the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
entitles states and municipalities to set minimum wages beyond the federal minimum. By contrast, other statutes such as the
National Labor Relations Act
of 1935, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970
,
[87]
and the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
,
[88]
have been interpreted in a series of contentious judgments by the
US Supreme Court
to "
preempt
" state law enactments.
[89]
These interpretations have had the effect to "stay experimentation in things social and economic" and stop states wanting to "serve as a laboratory" by improving labor rights.
[90]
Where minimum rights do not exist in federal or state statutes, principles of
contract law
, and potentially
torts
, will apply.
Employment contracts are subject to minimum rights in state and federal statute, and those created by
collective agreements
.
[91]
Aside from terms in oral or written agreements, terms can be incorporated by reference. Two main sources are
collective agreements
and company handbooks. In
JI Case Co v. National Labor Relations Board
an employing corporation argued it should not have to bargain in
good faith
with a labor union, and did not commit an
unfair labor practice
by refusing, because it had recently signed individual contracts with its employees.
[92]
The
US Supreme Court
held unanimously that the "very purpose" of collective bargaining and the
National Labor Relations Act 1935
was "to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group". Terms of collective agreements, to the advantage of individual employees, therefore supersede individual contracts. Similarly, if a written contract states that employees do not have rights, but an employee has been told they do by a supervisor, or rights are assured in a company handbook, they will usually have a claim.
[93]
For example, in
Torosyan v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
the
Supreme Court of Connecticut
held that a promise in a handbook that an employee could be dismissed only for a good reason (or "just cause") was binding on the employing corporation. Furthermore, an employer had no right to unilaterally change the terms.
[94]
Most other state courts have reached the same conclusion, that contracts cannot be altered, except for employees' benefit, without new
consideration
and true agreement.
[95]
By contrast, a slight majority on the
California Supreme Court
, appointed by Republican governors, held in
Asmus v. Pacific Bell
that a company policy of indefinite duration can be altered after a reasonable time with reasonable notice, if it affects no vested benefits.
[96]
The four dissenting judges, appointed by Democratic governors, held this was a "patently unfair, indeed unconscionable, result—permitting an employer that made a promise of continuing job security ... to repudiate that promise with impunity several years later". In addition, a basic term of
good faith
which cannot be waived, is implied by common law or equity in all states. This usually demands, as a general principle that "neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract".
[97]
The term of
good faith
persists throughout the employment relationship. It has not yet been used extensively by state courts, compared to other jurisdictions. The
Montana Supreme Court
has recognized that extensive and even punitive damages could be available for breach of an employee's reasonable expectations.
[98]
However others, such as the
California Supreme Court
limit any recovery of damages to contract breaches, but not damages regarding the manner of termination.
[99]
By contrast, in the
United Kingdom
the requirement for "
good faith
"
[100]
has been found to limit the power of discharge except for fair reasons
[101]
(but not to conflict with statute
[102]
), in Canada it may limit unjust discharge also for self-employed persons,
[103]
and in Germany it can preclude the payment of wages significantly below average.
[104]
Finally, it was traditionally thought that arbitration clauses could not displace any employment rights, and therefore limit access to justice in public courts.
[105]
However, in
14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett
,
[106]
in a 5 to 4 decision under the
Federal Arbitration Act
of 1925, individual employment contract arbitration clauses are to be enforced according to their terms. The four dissenting judges argued that this would eliminate rights in a way that the law never intended.
[107]
Wages and pay
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Fair Labor Standards Act
,
Minimum wage in the US
,
List of U.S. minimum wages
,
Executive pay in the US
, and
Income tax in the US
While contracts often determine wages and terms of employment, the law refuses to enforce contracts that do not observe basic standards of fairness for employees.
[108]
Today, the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
aims to create a national minimum wage, and a voice at work, especially through collective bargaining should achieve fair wages. A growing body of
law
also regulates
executive pay
, although a system of "
maximum wage
" regulation, for instance by the former
Stabilization Act of 1942
, is not currently in force. Historically, the law actually suppressed
wages
, not of the highly paid, by ordinary workers. For example, in 1641 the
Massachusetts Bay Colony
legislature
(dominated by property owners and the official church) required wage reductions, and said rising wages "tende to the ruin of the Churches and the
Commonwealth
".
[109]
In the early 20th century, democratic opinion demanded everyone had a
minimum wage
, and could bargain for fair wages beyond the minimum. But when states tried to introduce new laws, the
US Supreme Court
held them unconstitutional. A right to
freedom of contract
, argued a majority, could be construed from the
Fifth
and
Fourteenth Amendment
's protection against being deprived "of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". Dissenting judges argued that "due process" did not affect the legislative power to create social or economic rights, because employees "are not upon a full
level of equality
of choice with their employer".
[110]
The
real
federal minimum wage has declined by 46% since February 1968. Lower line is
nominal dollars
. Top line is
inflation-adjusted
.
[111]
[112]
After the
Wall Street Crash
, and the
New Deal
with the election of
Franklin D. Roosevelt
, the majority in the
US Supreme Court
was changed. In
West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish
Hughes CJ
held (over four dissenters still arguing for
Freedom of Contract
) that a
Washington
law setting minimum wages for women was constitutional because the state legislatures should be enabled to adopt legislation in the public interest.
[113]
This ended the "
Lochner
era", and Congress enacted the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
.
[114]
Under §202(a) the federal minimum wage aims to ensure a "standard of living necessary for health, efficiency and general well being".
[115]
Under §207(a)(1), most employees (but with many exceptions) working over 40 hours a week must receive 50 per cent more
overtime
pay on their hourly wage.
[116]
Nobody may pay lower than the minimum wage, but under §218(a) states and municipal governments may enact higher wages.
[117]
This is frequently done to reflect local productivity and requirements for decent living in each region.
[118]
However the federal minimum wage has no automatic mechanism to update with inflation. Because the
Republican Party
has opposed raising wages, the federal
real minimum wage
is over 33 per cent lower today than in 1968, among the lowest in the industrialized world.
People have campaigned for a $15 an hour minimum wage, because the
real minimum wage
has fallen by 43% compared to 1968.
[112]
In "
tipped
" jobs, some states still enable employers to take their workers' tips for between $2.13 and the $7.25 minimum wage per hour.
Although there is a federal minimum wage, it has been restricted in (1) the scope of who it covers, (2) the time that counts to calculate the hourly minimum wage, and (3) the amount that employers' can take from their employees' tips or deduct for expenses. First, five
US Supreme Court
judges held in
Alden v. Maine
that the federal minimum wage cannot be enforced for employees of state governments, unless the state has consented, because that would violate the
Eleventh Amendment
.
[119]
Souter J
, joined by three dissenting justices,
[120]
held that no such "sovereign immunity" existed in the
Eleventh Amendment
.
[121]
Twenty-eight states
, however, did have minimum wage laws higher than the federal level in 2016. Further, because the
US Constitution
,
article one
,
section 8, clause 3
only allows the federal government to "regulate
Commerce
... among the several States", employees of any "enterprise" under $500,000 making goods or services that do not enter commerce are not covered: they must rely on state minimum wage laws.
[122]
FLSA 1938
§203(s) explicitly exempts establishments whose only employees are close family members.
[123]
Under §213 the minimum wage may not be paid to 18 categories of employee, and paying overtime to 30 categories of employee.
[124]
This include under §213(a)(1) employees of "
bona fide
executive, administrative, or professional capacity". In
Auer v. Robbins
police sergeants and lieutenants at the
St Louis
Police Department,
Missouri
claimed they should not be classed as executives or professional employees, and should get overtime pay.
[125]
Scalia J
held that, following
Department of Labor
guidance, the St Louis police commissioners were entitled to exempt them. This has encouraged employers to attempt to define staff as more "senior" and make them work longer hours while avoiding overtime pay.
[126]
Another exemption in §213(a)(15) is for people "employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services". In
Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke
, a corporation claimed exemption, although
Breyer J
for a unanimous court agreed with the
Department of Labor
that it was only intended for carers in private homes.
[127]
Second, because §206(a)(1)(C) says the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, courts have grappled with which hours count as "working".
[128]
Early cases established that time traveling to work did not count as work, unless it was controlled by, required by, and for the benefit of an employer, like traveling through a coal mine.
[129]
For example, in,
Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.
a majority of five to two justices held that employees had to be paid for the long walk to work through an employer's Mount Clemens Pottery Co facility.
[130]
According to
Murphy J
this time, and time setting up workstations, involved "exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employer's benefit."
[131]
In
Armour & Co. v. Wantock
firefighters
claimed they should be fully paid while on call at their station for fires. The
Supreme Court
held that, even though the firefighters could sleep or play cards, because "[r]eadiness to serve may be hired quite as much as service itself" and time waiting on call was "a benefit to the employer".
[132]
By contrast, in 1992 the
Sixth Circuit
controversially held that needing to be infrequently available by phone or pager, where movement was not restricted, was not working time.
[133]
Time spent doing unusual cleaning, for instance showering off toxic substances, does count as working time,
[134]
and so does time putting on special protective gear.
[135]
Under §207(e) pay for overtime should be one and a half times the regular pay. In
Walling v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.
, the
Supreme Court
held that an employer's scheme of paying lower wages in the morning, and higher wages in the afternoon, to argue that overtime only needed to be calculated on top of (lower) morning wages was unlawful. Overtime has to be calculated based on the average regular pay.
[136]
However, in
Christensen v. Harris County
six
Supreme Court
judges held that police in
Harris County, Texas
could be forced to use up their accumulated "compensatory time" (allowing time off with full pay) before claiming overtime.
[137]
Writing for the dissent,
Stevens J
said the majority had misconstrued §207(o)(2), which requires an "agreement" between employers, unions or employees on the applicable rules, and the Texas police had not agreed.
[138]
Third, §203(m) allows employers to deduct sums from wages for food or housing that is "customarily furnished" for employees. The
Secretary of Labor
may determine what counts as fair value. Most problematically, outside states that have banned the practice, they may deduct money from a "tipped employee" for money over the "cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996"—and this was $2.13 per hour. If an employee does not earn enough in tips, the employer must still pay the $7.25 minimum wage. But this means in many states tips do not go to workers: tips are taken by employers to subsidize low pay. Under
FLSA 1938
§216(b)-(c) the Secretary of State can enforce the law, or individuals can claim on their own behalf. Federal enforcement is rare, so most employees are successful if they are in a labor union. The
Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968
limits deductions or "garnishments" by employers to 25 per cent of wages,
[139]
though many states are considerably more protective. Finally, under the
Portal to Portal Act of 1947
, where Congress limited the minimum wage laws in a range of ways, §254 puts a two-year time limit on enforcing claims, or three years if an employing entity is guilty of a willful violation.

The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
of 1948 article 23 requires "reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay", but there is no federal or state right to
paid annual leave
: Americans have the least in the developed world.
[141]
People in the United States work among the longest hours per week in the
industrialized world
, and have the least annual leave.
[142]
The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
of 1948 article 24 states: "Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and
periodic holidays with pay
." However, there is no general federal or state legislation requiring paid annual leave. Title 5 of the
United States Code
§6103 specifies ten
public holidays
for federal government employees, and provides that holidays will be paid.
[143]
Many states do the same, however, no state law requires private sector employers to provide paid holidays. Many private employers follow the norms of federal and state government, but the right to annual leave, if any, will depend upon
collective agreements
and individual employment contracts. State law proposals have been made to introduce paid annual leave. A 2014
Washington
Bill from
United States House of Representatives
member
Gael Tarleton
would have required a minimum of 3 weeks of paid holidays each year to employees in businesses of over 20 staff, after 3 years work. Under the
International Labour Organization
Holidays with Pay Convention 1970
[144]
three weeks is the bare minimum. The Bill did not receive enough votes.
[145]
By contrast, employees in all
European Union
countries have the right to at least 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days) of paid annual leave each year.
[146]
Furthermore, there is no federal or state law on limits to the length of the working week. Instead, the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
§207 creates a financial disincentive to longer working hours. Under the heading "Maximum hours", §207 states that
time and a half
pay must be given to employees working more than 40 hours in a week.
[116]
It does not, however, set an actual limit, and there are at least 30 exceptions for categories of employee which do not receive overtime pay.
[147]
Shorter working time was one of the labor movement's original demands. From the first decades of the 20th century, collective bargaining produced the practice of having, and the word for, a two-day "weekend".
[148]
State legislation to limit working time was, however, suppressed by the
US Supreme Court
in
Lochner v. New York
.
[149]
The
New York State Legislature
had passed the Bakeshop Act of 1895, which limited work in bakeries to 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week, to improve health, safety and people's living conditions. After being prosecuted for making his staff work longer in his
Utica
, Mr Lochner claimed that the law violated the
Fourteenth Amendment
on "
due process
". Despite the dissent of four judges, a majority of five judges held that the law was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, however, did uphold Utah's mine workday statute in 1898.
[150]
The Mississippi State Supreme Court upheld a ten hour workday statute in 1912 when it ruled against the due process arguments of an interstate lumber company.
[151]
The whole
Lochner
era
of jurisprudence was reversed by the
US Supreme Court
in 1937,
[152]
but experimentation to improve working time rights, and "
work-life balance
" has not yet recovered.
Because there is no right to education and
child care
for
children under five
, the costs of child care fall on parents. But in 2016, four states had legislated for
paid family leave
.
[153]
Just as there are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or
family leave
in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most collective agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack
bargaining power
will often get none.
[154]
There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year.
[155]
Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health.
[156]
Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise.
[157]
Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is "foreseeable",
[158]
and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" according to medical advice.
[159]
Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave.
[160]
Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California,
New Jersey
,
Rhode Island
and
New York
had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the
US Supreme Court
in
Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc.
held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law.
[161]
After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer."
[162]
Employees or the
Secretary of Labor
can bring enforcement actions,
[163]
but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law.
[164]
There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations.
[165]
Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free
child care
or
day care
. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.
[166]
Pensions
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Pensions in the United States
,
List of largest pension schemes in the US
, and
Investment manager
In the early 20th century, the possibility of having a "retirement" became real as people lived longer,
[167]
and believed the elderly should not have to work or rely on charity until they died.
[168]
The law maintains an income in retirement in three ways (1) through a public
social security
program created by the Social Security Act of 1935,
[169]
(2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or
life insurance
that individuals buy themselves. At work, most
occupational pension
schemes originally resulted from
collective bargaining
during the 1920s and 1930s.
[170]
Unions usually bargained for employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by
collective agreement
became known as "
Taft-Hartley plans
" after the
Taft-Hartley Act
of 194] required joint management of funds by employees and employers.
[171]
Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called
TIAA
, was established on the initiative of
Andrew Carnegie
in 1918 with the express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees.
[172]
These could be collective and
defined benefit
schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual "
401(k)
" plans. These are named after the
Internal Revenue Code
§
401(k)
,
[173]
which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same
tax deferral
rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a "
defined benefit
" plan, a
401(k)
only contains whatever the employer and employee
contribute
. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have minimum social security. The
Pension Protection Act of 2006
§902 codified a model for employers to
automatically enroll
their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out.
[174]
However, there is no right to an occupational pension. The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other "employee benefit" plan.
[175]
Investment managers, like
Morgan Stanley
and all pension trustees, are
fiduciaries
. This means they must avoid
conflicts of interest
. During a takeover bid,
Donovan v. Bierwirth
held trustees must take advice or not vote on corporate stocks if in doubt about
conflicts
.
[176]
Five main rights for beneficiaries in
ERISA 1974
include information,
funding
,
vesting
,
anti-discrimination
, and
fiduciary duties
. First, each beneficiary should receive a "summary plan description" in 90 days of joining, plans must file annual reports with the
Secretary of Labor
, and if beneficiaries make claims any refusal must be justified with a "full and fair review".
[177]
If the "summary plan description" is more beneficial than the actual plan documents, because the pension fund makes a mistake, a beneficiary may enforce the terms of either.
[178]
If an employer has pension or other plans, all employees must be entitled to participate after at longest 12 months, if working over 1000 hours.
[179]
Second, all promises must be funded in advance.
[180]
The
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
was established by the federal government to be an insurer of last resort, but only up to $60,136 per year for each employer. Third, employees' benefits usually cannot be taken away (they "
vest
") after 5 years,
[181]
and contributions must
accrue
(i.e. the employee owns contributions) at a proportionate rate.
[182]
If employers and pension funds merge, there can be no reduction in benefits,
[183]
and if an employee goes bankrupt their creditors cannot take their occupational pension.
[184]
However, the
US Supreme Court
has enabled benefits to be withdrawn by employers simply amending plans. In
Lockheed Corp. v. Spink
a majority of seven judges held that an employer could alter a plan, to deprive a 61-year-old man of full benefits when he was reemployed, unbound by
fiduciary duties
to preserve what an employee had originally been promised.
[185]
In dissent,
Breyer J
and
Souter J
reserved any view on such "highly technical, important matters".
[186]
Steps to terminate a plan depend on whether it is individual, or multi-employer, and
Mead Corp. v. Tilley
a majority of the
US Supreme Court
held that employers could recoup excess benefits paid into pension plans after
PBGC
conditions are fulfilled.
Stevens J
, dissenting, contended that all contingent and future liabilities must be satisfied.
[187]
Fourth, as a general principle, employees or beneficiaries cannot suffer any discrimination or detriment for "the attainment of any right" under a plan.
[188]
Fifth, managers are bound by responsibilities of competence and loyalty, called "
fiduciary duties
".
[189]
Under §1102, a
fiduciary
is anyone who administers a plan, its trustees, and investment managers who are delegated control. Under §1104,
fiduciaries
must follow a "
prudent
" person standard, involving three main components. First, a fiduciary must act "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan".
[190]
Second, they must act with "care, skill and diligence", including "diversifying the investments of the plan" to "minimize the risk of large losses".
[191]
Liability for carelessness extends to making misleading statements about benefits,
[192]
and have been interpreted by the
Department of Labor
to involve a duty to vote on proxies when
corporate stocks
are purchased, and publicizing a statement of investment policy.
[193]
Third, and codifying fundamental equitable principles, a
fiduciary
must avoid any possibility of a
conflict of interest
.
[194]
Fiduciaries must act "solely in the interest of the participants ... for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits" with "reasonable expenses",
[195]
and specifically avoiding
self-dealing
with a related "party in interest".
[196]
For example, in
Donovan v. Bierwirth
, the
Second Circuit
held that trustees of a pension which owned shares in the employees' company as a
takeover
bid was launched, because they faced a potential
conflict of interest
, had to get independent legal advice on how to vote, or possibly abstain.
[197]
Remedies for these duties have, however, been restricted by the
Supreme Court
to disfavor damages.
[198]
In these fields, according to §1144,
ERISA 1974
will "supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan".
[199]
ERISA did not, therefore, follow the model of the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
or the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
, which encourage states to legislate for improved protection for employees, beyond the minimum. The preemption rule led the
US Supreme Court
to strike down a
New York
that required giving benefits to pregnant employees in
ERISA
plans.
[200]
It held a case under
Texas
law for damages for denying vesting of benefits was preempted, so the claimant only had
ERISA
remedies.
[201]
It struck down a
Washington
law which altered who would receive life insurance designation on death.
[202]
However, under §1144(b)(2)(A) this does not affect 'any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or
securities
.' So, the Supreme Court has also held valid a
Massachusetts
law requiring mental health to be covered by employer group health policies.
[203]
But it struck down a
Pennsylvania
statute which prohibited employers becoming subrogated to (potentially more valuable) claims of employees for insurance after accidents.
[204]
Yet more recently, the court has shown a greater willingness to prevent laws being preempted,
[205]
however the courts have not yet adopted the principle that state law is not preempted or "superseded" if it is more protective to employees than a federal minimum.
The
Workplace Democracy Act of 1999
,
[206]
proposed by
Bernie Sanders
but not yet passed, would give every employee the representatives on boards of their pension plans, to control how vote are cast on
corporate stocks
. Currently
investment managers
control most voting rights in the economy using "other people's money".
[207]
The most important rights that
ERISA 1974
did not cover were who controls investments and
securities
that beneficiaries' retirement savings buy. The largest form of retirement fund has become the
401(k)
. This is often an individual account that an employer sets up, and an
investment management
firm, such as
Vanguard
,
Fidelity
,
Morgan Stanley
or
BlackRock
, is then delegated the task of trading fund assets. Usually they also vote on corporate shares, assisted by a "proxy advice" firm such as
ISS
or
Glass Lewis
. Under
ERISA 1974
§1102(a),
[208]
a plan must merely have named fiduciaries who have "authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan", selected by "an employer or employee organization" or both jointly. Usually these
fiduciaries
or
trustees
, will delegate management to a professional firm, particularly because under §1105(d), if they do so, they will not be liable for an investment manager's breaches of duty.
[209]
These investment managers buy a range of assets, particularly
corporate stocks
which have voting rights, as well as
government bonds
,
corporate bonds
,
commodities
, real estate or
derivatives
. Rights on those assets are in practice monopolized by investment managers, unless pension funds have organized to take voting in house, or to instruct their investment managers. Two main types of pension fund to do this are union organized
Taft-Hartley plans
, and
state public pension plans
. Under the amended
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
§302(c)(5)(B) a union bargained plan has to be jointly managed by representatives of employers and employees.
[210]
Although many local pension funds are not consolidated and have had critical funding notices from the
Department of Labor
,
[211]
more funds with employee representation ensure that corporate voting rights are cast according to the preferences of their members.
State public pensions
are often larger, and have greater
bargaining power
to use on their members' behalf. State pension schemes invariably disclose the way trustees are selected. In 2005, on average more than a third of trustees were elected by employees or beneficiaries.
[212]
For example, the
California Government Code
§20090 requires that its public employee pension fund,
CalPERS
has 13 members on its board, 6 elected by employees and beneficiaries. However, only pension funds of sufficient size have acted to replace
investment manager
voting. Furthermore, no general legislation requires voting rights for employees in pension funds, despite several proposals.
[213]
For example, the
Workplace Democracy Act of 1999
, sponsored by
Bernie Sanders
then in the
US House of Representatives
, would have required all single employer pension plans to have trustees appointed equally by employers and employee representatives.
[206]
There is, furthermore, currently no legislation to stop investment managers voting with other people's money as the
Dodd-Frank Act
of 2010 §957 banned
broker-dealers
voting on significant issues without instructions.
[214]
This means votes in the largest
corporations
that people's retirement savings buy are overwhelmingly exercised by investment managers, whose interests potentially conflict with the interests of beneficiaries' on
labor rights
,
fair pay
,
job security
, or pension policy.

The
Occupational Safety and Health Act
,
[215]
signed into law in 1970 by President
Richard Nixon
, creates specific standards for workplace safety. The Act has spawned years of litigation by industry groups that have challenged the standards limiting the amount of permitted exposure to chemicals such as
benzene
. The Act also provides for protection for "whistleblowers" who complain to governmental authorities about unsafe conditions while allowing workers the right to refuse to work under unsafe conditions in certain circumstances. The Act allows states to take over the administration of OSHA in their jurisdictions, so long as they adopt state laws at least as protective of workers' rights as under federal law. More than half of the states have done so.

Workplace participation

]
See also:
Collective bargaining
,
US corporate law
,

, and
Work council
The
US Supreme Court
's policy of
preemption
since 1953 means federal
collective bargaining
rules cancel state rules, even if state law is more beneficial to employees.
[49]
Despite preemption, many unions,
corporations
, and states have experimented with direct participation rights, to get a "
fair day's wage for a fair day's work
".
[216]
The central right in
labor law
, beyond minimum standards for pay, hours, pensions, safety or privacy, is to participate and vote in workplace governance.
[217]
The American model developed from the
Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914
,
[218]
which declared the "labor of a
human being
is not a
commodity
or article of commerce" and aimed to take workplace relations out of the reach of courts hostile to collective bargaining. Lacking success, the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
changed the basic model, which remained through the 20th century. Reflecting the "
inequality of bargaining power
between employees ... and employers who are organized in the
corporate
or other forms of ownership association",
[219]
the
NLRA 1935
codified basic rights of employees to organize a
union
, requires employers to bargain in
good faith
(at least on paper) after a union has majority support, binds employers to
collective agreements
, and protects the right to take
collective action
including a strike. Union membership, collective bargaining, and standards of living all increased rapidly until Congress forced through the
Taft-Hartley Act
of 1947. Its amendments enabled states to pass laws restricting agreements for all employees in a workplace to be unionized, prohibited collective action against associated employers, and introduced a list of unfair labor practices for unions, as well as employers. Since then, the
US Supreme Court
chose to develop a doctrine that the rules in the
NLRA 1935
preempted any other state rules if an activity was "arguably subject" to its rights and duties.
[220]
While states were inhibited from acting as "
laboratories of democracy
", and particularly as unions were targeted from 1980 and membership fell, the
NLRA 1935
has been criticized as a "failed statute" as US labor law "ossified".
[221]
This has led to more innovative experiments among states, progressive corporations and unions to create direct participation rights, including the right to vote for or
codetermine
directors of corporate boards, and elect
work councils
with binding rights on workplace issues.
Labor unions
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Labor unions in the US
and
List of labor unions in the US
Freedom of association
in labor unions has always been fundamental to the development of democratic society, and is protected by the
First Amendment to the Constitution
.
[222]
In early
colonial history
, labor unions were routinely suppressed by the government. Recorded instances include cart drivers being fined for striking in 1677 in New York City, and carpenters prosecuted as criminals for striking in
Savannah
,
Georgia
in 1746.
[223]
After the
American Revolution
, however, courts departed from repressive elements of
English common law
. The first reported case,
Commonwealth v. Pullis
in 1806 did find shoemakers in
Philadelphia
guilty of "a combination to raise their wages".
[224]
Nevertheless, unions continued, and the first federation of trade unions was formed in 1834, the
National Trades' Union
, with the primary aim of a 10-hour working day.
[225]
In 1842 the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts
held in
Commonwealth v. Hunt
that a strike by the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers' Society for higher wages was lawful.
[226]
Chief Justice Shaw
held that people "are free to work for whom they please, or not to work, if they so prefer" and "to agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights". The abolition of
slavery
by
Abraham Lincoln
's
Emancipation Proclamation
during the
American Civil War
was necessary to create genuine rights to organize, but was not sufficient to ensure freedom of association. Using the
Sherman Act of 1890
, which was intended to break up business cartels, the Supreme Court imposed an injunction on striking workers of the
Pullman Company
, and imprisoned the leader, and future presidential candidate,
Eugene Debs
.
[227]
The Court also enabled unions to be sued for triple damages in
Loewe v. Lawlor
, a case involving a
hat maker
union in
Danbury, Connecticut
.
[228]
The President and
United States Congress
responded by passing the
Clayton Act of 1914
to take labor out of
antitrust law
. Then, after the
Great Depression
passed the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
to positively protect the right to organize and take collective action. After that, the law increasingly turned to regulate unions' internal affairs. The
Taft-Hartley Act
of 1947 regulated how members can join a union, and the
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959
created a "bill of rights" for union members.
Richard Trumka
was the late president of the
AFL-CIO
, a federation of unions, with 12.5m members. The
Change to Win Federation
has 5.5m members in affiliated unions. The two have negotiated merging to create a united American labor movement.
While union governance is founded upon
freedom of association
, the law requires basic standards of democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations.
[229]
Fundamentally, all unions are democratic organizations,
[230]
but they divide between those where members elect delegates, who in turn choose the executive, and those where members directly elect the executive. In 1957, after the
McClellan Committee
of the
US Senate
found evidence of two rival
Teamsters Union
executives,
Jimmy Hoffa
and
Dave Beck
, falsifying delegate vote counts and stealing union funds,
[231]
Congress passed the
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959
. Under § 411, every member has the right to vote, attend meetings, speak freely and organize, not have fees raised without a vote, not be deprived of the right to sue, or be suspended unjustly.
[232]
Under § 431, unions should file their constitutions and bylaws with the
Secretary of Labor
and be accessible by members:
[233]
today union constitutions are online. Under § 481 elections must occur at least every 5 years, and local officers every 3 years, by secret ballot.
[233]
Additionally, state law may bar union officials who have prior convictions for felonies from holding office.
[234]
As a response to the Hoffa and Beck scandals, there is also an express
fiduciary duty
on union officers for members' money, limits on loans to executives, requirements for bonds for handling money, and up to a $10,000 fine or up to 5 years prison for
embezzlement
. These rules, however, restated most of what was already the law, and codified principles of governance that unions already undertook.
[235]
On the other hand, under § 501(b) to bring a lawsuit, a union member must first make a demand on the executive to correct wrongdoing before any claim can be made to a court, even for misapplication of funds, and potentially wait four months' time. The Supreme Court has held that union members can intervene in enforcement proceedings brought by the
US Department of Labor
.
[236]
Federal courts may review decisions by the Department to proceed with any prosecutions.
[237]
The range of rights, and the level of enforcement has meant that labor unions display significantly higher standards of accountability, with fewer scandals, than corporations or
financial institutions
.
[238]
Sharan Burrow
leads the
International Trade Union Confederation
, which represents labor union members worldwide, via each national group including the
AFL-CIO
.
[239]
Beyond members rights within a labor union, the most controversial issue has been how people become members in unions. This affects union membership numbers, and whether labor rights are promoted or suppressed in democratic politics. Historically, unions made
collective agreements
with employers that all new workers would have to join the union. This was to prevent employers trying to dilute and divide union support, and ultimately refuse to improve wages and conditions in
collective bargaining
. However, after the
Taft-Hartley Act
of 1947, the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
§ 158(a)(3) was amended to ban employers from refusing to hire a non-union employee. An employee can be required to join the union (if such a collective agreement is in place) after 30 days.
[240]
But § 164(b) was added to codify a right of states to pass so called "
right to work laws
" that prohibit unions making collective agreements to register all workers as union members, or collect fees for the service of collective bargaining.
[241]
Over time, as more states with
Republican
governments passed laws restricting union membership agreements, there has been a significant decline of
union density
. Unions have not, however, yet experimented with agreements to
automatically enroll
employees in unions with a right to opt out. In
International Ass'n of Machinists v. Street
, a majority of the
US Supreme Court
, against three dissenting justices, held that the
First Amendment
precluded making an employee become a union member against their will, but it would be lawful to collect fees to reflect the benefits from collective bargaining: fees could not be used for spending on political activities without the member's consent.
[242]
Unions have always been entitled to publicly campaign for members of Congress or presidential candidates that support
labor rights
.
[243]
But the urgency of political spending was raised when in 1976
Buckley v. Valeo
decided, over powerful dissents of
White J
and
Marshall J
, that candidates could spend unlimited money on their own political campaign,
[244]
and then in
First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti
,
[245]
that corporations could engage in election spending. In 2010, over four dissenting justices,
Citizens United v. FEC
[246]
held there could be essentially no limits to corporate spending. By contrast, every other democratic country caps spending (usually as well as regulating donations) as the original
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
had intended to do. A unanimous court held in
Abood v. Detroit Board of Education
that
union security agreements
to collect fees from non-members were also allowed in the public sector.
[247]
However, in
Harris v. Quinn
five
US Supreme Court
judges reversed this ruling apparently banning public sector union security agreements,
[248]
and were about to do the same for all unions in
Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association
until
Scalia J
died, halting an anti-labor majority on the Supreme Court.
[249]
In 2018,
Janus v. AFSCME
the Supreme Court held by 5 to 4 that collecting mandatory union fees from public sector employees violated the First Amendment. The dissenting judges argued that union fees merely paid for benefits of collective bargaining that non-members otherwise received for free. These factors led campaign finance reform to be one of the most important issues in the
2016 US Presidential election
, for the future of the labor movement, and democratic life.
Collective bargaining
[

Main articles:
Collective bargaining
,
Arbitration in the US
,
National Labor Relations Act 1935
,
Taft-Hartley Act
,
Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute
, and
Railway Labor Act
Since the
Industrial Revolution
, collective bargaining has been the main way to get
fair pay
, improved conditions, and a voice at work. The need for positive rights to organize and bargain was gradually appreciated after the
Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914
. Under §6,
[250]
labor rights were declared to be outside of
antitrust law
, but this did not stop hostile employers and courts suppressing unions. In
Adair v. United States
,
[251]
and
Coppage v. Kansas
,
[252]
the
Supreme Court
, over powerful dissents,
[253]
asserted the Constitution empowered employers to require employees to sign
contracts
promising they would not join a union. These "
yellow-dog contracts
" were offered to employees on a "
take it or leave it
" basis, and effectively stopped unionization. They lasted until the
Great Depression
when the
Norris-La Guardia Act
of 1932 banned them.
[254]
This also prevented the courts from issuing any injunctions or enforcing any agreements in the context of a labor dispute.
[255]
After the
landslide election
of
Franklin D. Roosevelt
, the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
was drafted to create positive rights for collective bargaining in most of the private sector.
[256]
It aimed to create a system of federal rights so that, under §157, employees would gain the legal "right to self-organization", "to bargain collectively" and use "concerted activities" including strikes for "mutual aid or other protection".
[257]
The Act was meant to increase
bargaining power
of employees to get better terms in than individual contracts with employing corporations. However §152 excluded many groups of workers, such as state and
federal government employees
,
[258]
railway and airline
staff,
[259]
domestic and
agriculture
workers.
[260]
These groups depend on special federal statutes like the
Railway Labor Act
or state law rules, like the
California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975
. In 1979, five
Supreme Court
judges, over four forceful dissents, also introduced an exception for church operated schools, apparently because of "serious
First Amendment
questions".
[261]
Furthermore, "independent contractors" are excluded, even though many are economically dependent workers. Some courts have attempted to expand the "independent contractor" exception. In 2009, in
FedEx Home Delivery v. NLRB
the
DC Circuit
, adopting submissions of
FedEx
's lawyer
Ted Cruz
, held that post truck drivers were independent contractors because they took on "entrepreneurial opportunity".
Garland J
dissented, arguing the majority had departed from common law tests.
[262]
The "independent contractor" category was estimated to remove protection from 8 million workers.
[263]
While many states have higher rates, the US has an 11.1 per cent
unionization rate
and 12.3 per cent rate of
coverage by collective agreement
. This is the lowest in the industrialized world.
[264]
After
1981 air traffic control strike
, when
Ronald Reagan
fired every air traffic controller,
[265]
the
National Labor Relations Board
was staffed by people opposed to collective bargaining. Between 2007 and 2013 the NLRB was shut down as the President and then
Senate
refused to make appointments.
At any point employers can freely bargain with union representatives and make a
collective agreement
. Under
NLRA 1935
§158(d) the mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment".
[266]
A collective agreement will typically aim to get rights including a
fair day's wage for a fair day's work
, reasonable notice and severance pay before any necessary
layoffs
,
just cause
for any job termination, and
arbitration
to resolve disputes. It could also extend to any subject by mutual agreement. A union can encourage an employing entity through
collective action
to sign a deal, without using the
NLRA 1935
procedure. But, if an employing entity refuses to deal with a union, and a union wishes, the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) may oversee a legal process up to the conclusion of a legally binding
collective agreement
. By law, the NLRB is meant to have five members "appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate
",
[267]
and play a central role in promoting collective bargaining. First, the NLRB will determine an appropriate "
bargaining unit
" of employees with employers (e.g., offices in a city, or state, or whole economic sector),
[268]
The NLRB favors "
enterprise bargaining
" over "
sectoral collective bargaining
", which means US unions have traditionally been smaller with less
bargaining power
by international standards. Second, a union with "majority" support of employees in a bargaining unit becomes "the exclusive representatives of all the employees".
[269]
But to ascertain majority support, the NLRB supervises the fairness of elections among the workforce. It is typical for the NLRB to take six weeks from a petition from workers to an election being held.
[270]
During this time, managers may attempt to persuade or coerce employees using high-pressure tactics or
unfair labor practices
(e.g. threatening job termination, alleging unions will bankrupt the firm) to vote against recognizing the union. The average time for the
NLRB
to decide upon complaints of unfair labor practices had grown to 483 days in 2009 when its last annual report was written.
[271]
Third, if a union does win majority support in a bargaining unit election, the employing entity will have an "obligation to bargain collectively". This means meeting union representatives "at reasonable times and confer in
good faith
with respect to wages, hours, and other terms" to put in a "written contract". The NLRB cannot compel an employer to agree, but it was thought that the NLRB's power to sanction an employer for an "unfair labor practice" if they did not bargain in good faith would be sufficient. For example, in
JI Case Co v. National Labor Relations Board
the
Supreme Court
held an employer could not refuse to bargain on the basis that individual contracts were already in place.
[272]
Crucially, in
Wallace Corp. v. NLRB
the Supreme Court also held that an employer only bargaining with a
company union
, which it dominated, was an
unfair labor practice
. The employer should have recognized the truly
independent union
affiliated to the
Congress of Industrial Organizations
(CIO).
[273]
However, in
NLRB v. Sands Manufacturing Co.
the Supreme Court held an employer did not commit an unfair trade practice by shutting down a water heater plant, while the union was attempting to prevent new employees being paid less.
[274]
Moreover, after 2007 President
George W. Bush
and the
Senate
refused to make any appointments to the Board, and it was held by five judges, over four dissents, in
New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB
that rules made by two remaining members were ineffective.
[275]
While appointments were made in 2013, agreement was not reached on one vacant seat. Increasingly it has been made politically unfeasible for the
NLRB
to act to promote collective bargaining.
The proposed
Employee Free Choice Act
, sponsored repeatedly by
Hillary Clinton
,
Bernie Sanders
and Democrat representatives, would require employers to bargain in 90 days or go to arbitration, if a simple majority of employees sign cards supporting the union.
[276]
It has been blocked by
Republicans
in
Congress
.
Once collective agreements have been signed, they are legally enforceable, often through
arbitration
, and ultimately in federal court.
[277]
Federal law must be applied for national uniformity, so state courts must apply federal law when asked to deal with collective agreements or the dispute can be removed to federal court.
[278]
Usually, collective agreements include provisions for sending grievances of employees or disputes to binding
arbitration
, governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act
of 1925.
[279]
For example, in
United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co
a group of employees at a steel transportation works in
Chickasaw, Alabama
requested the corporation go to
arbitration
over layoffs and outsourcing of 19 staff on lower pay to do the same jobs. The
United Steelworkers
had a collective agreement which contained a provision for arbitration.
Douglas J
held that any doubts about whether the agreement allowed the issue to go to arbitration "should be resolved in favor of coverage."
[280]
An arbitrator's award is entitled to judicial enforcement so long as its essence is from the collective agreement.
[281]
Courts can decline to enforce an agreement based on
public policy
, but this is different from "general considerations of supposed public interests".
[282]
But while federal policy had encouraged arbitration where unions and employers had made agreements, the
Supreme Court
drew a clear distinction for arbitration over individual statutory rights. In
Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.
an employee claimed he was unjustly terminated, and suffered unlawful
race discrimination
under the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
. The Supreme Court held that he was entitled to pursue remedies both through arbitration and the public courts, which could re-evaluate the claim whatever the arbitrator had decided.
[283]
But then, in 2009 in
14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett
Thomas J
announced with four other judges that apparently "[n]othing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements
signed by an individual employee
and those agreed to by a union representative."
[284]
This meant that a group of employees were denied the right to go to a public court under the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
, and instead potentially be heard only by arbitrators their employer selected.
Stevens J
and
Souter J
, joined by
Ginsburg J
,
Breyer J
dissented, pointing out that rights cannot be waived even by collective bargaining.
[285]
An
Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011
has been proposed to reverse this, urging that "employees have little or no meaningful choice whether to submit their claims to arbitration".
[286]
It remains unclear why
NLRA 1935
§1, recognizing workers' "
inequality of bargaining power
" was not considered relevant to ensure that collective bargaining can only improve upon rights, rather than take them away. To address further perceived defects of the NLRA 1935 and the
Supreme Court
's interpretations, major proposed reforms have included the
Labor Reform Act of 1977
,
[287]
the
Workplace Democracy Act
of 1999, and the
Employee Free Choice Act
of 2009.
[288]
All focus on speeding the election procedure for union recognition, speeding hearings for
unfair labor practices
, and improving remedies within the existing structure of labor relations.
Right to organize
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Freedom of association
,
Unfair labor practice
, and
Federal preemption
To ensure that employees are effectively able to bargain for a collective agreement, the
NLRA 1935
created a group of rights in §158 to stall "
unfair labor practices
" by employers. These were considerably amended by the
Taft-Hartley Act
of 1947, where the
US Congress
over the veto of President
Harry S. Truman
decided to add a list of unfair labor practices for labor unions. This has meant that union organizing in the US may involve substantial levels of
litigation
which most workers cannot afford. The fundamental principle of freedom of association, however, is recognized worldwide to require various rights. It extends to the state, so in
Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization
held the
New Jersey
mayor violated the
First Amendment
when trying to shut down
CIO
meetings because he thought they were "communist".
[289]
Among many rights and duties relating to unfair labor practices, five main groups of case have emerged.
Unfair labor practices
, made unlawful by the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
§153, prohibit employers discriminating against people who organize a union and
vote
to get a
voice at work
.
First, under §158(a)(3)-(4) a person who joins a union must suffer no discrimination or retaliation in their chances for being hired, terms of their work, or in termination.
[290]
For example, in one of the first cases,
NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp
, the US Supreme Court held that the
National Labor Relations Board
was entitled to order workers be rehired after they had been dismissed for organizing a union at their plant in
Aliquippa
,
Pennsylvania
.
[291]
It is also unlawful for employers to monitor employees who are organizing, for instance by parking outside a union meeting,
[292]
or videotaping employees giving out union fliers.
[293]
This can include giving people incentives or bribes to not join a union. So in
NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp
the Supreme Court held it was unlawful to give 20 years extra seniority to employees who crossed a
picket line
while the union had called a strike.
[294]
Second, and by contrast, the Supreme Court had decided in
Textile Workers Union of America v. Darlington Manufacturing Co Inc
that actually shutting down a recently unionized division of an enterprise was lawful, unless it was proven that the employer was motivated by hostility to the union.
[295]
Third, union members need the right to be represented, in order to carry out basic functions of collective bargaining and settle grievances or disciplinary hearings with management. This entails a
duty of fair representation
.
[296]
In
NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.
the Supreme Court held that an employee in a unionized workplace had the right to a union representative present in a management interview, if it could result in disciplinary action.
[297]
Although the
NLRB
has changed its position with different political appointees, the
DC Circuit
has held the same right goes that non-union workers were equally entitled to be accompanied.
[298]
Fourth, under §158(a)(5) it is an unfair labor practice to refuse to bargain in good faith, and out of this a right has developed for a union to receive information necessary to perform collective bargaining work. However, in
Detroit Edison Co v. NLRB
the Supreme Court divided 5 to 4 on whether a union was entitled to receive individual testing scores from a program the employer used.
[299]
Also, in
Lechmere, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board
the Supreme Court held 6 to 3 that an employer was entitled to prevent union members, who were not employees, from entering the company parking lot to hand out leaflets.
[300]
Fifth, there are a large group of cases concerning "unfair" practices of labor organizations, listed in §158(b). For example, in
Pattern Makers League of North America v. NLRB
an employer claimed a union had committed an unfair practice by attempting to enforce fines against employees who had been members, but quit during a strike when their membership agreement promised they would not. Five judges to four dissents held that such fines could not be enforced against people who were no longer union members.
[301]
As
union membership
declined
income inequality
rose, because labor unions have been the main way to participate at work.
[302]
The US does not yet require
employee representatives
on
boards of directors
, or elected
work councils
.
[303]
The
US Supreme Court
policy of
preemption
, developed from 1953,
[304]
means that states cannot legislate where the
NLRA 1935
does operate. The
NLRA 1935
contains no clause requiring
preemption
as is found, for example, in the
Fair Labor Standards Act 1938
§218(a) where deviations from the minimum wage or maximum hours are preempted, unless they are more beneficial to the employee.
[117]
The first major case,
Garner v. Teamsters Local 776
, decided a
Pennsylvania
statute was preempted from providing superior remedies or processing claims quicker than the
NLRB
because "the Board was vested with power to entertain petitioners' grievance, to issue its own complaint" and apparent "Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules".
[305]
In
San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon
, the
Supreme Court
held that the
California Supreme Court
was not entitled to award remedies against a union for picketing, because if "an activity is arguably subject to §7 or §8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board".
[306]
This was true, even though the NLRB had not given any ruling on the dispute because its monetary value was too small.
[307]
This reasoning was extended in
Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission
, where a
Wisconsin
Employment Relations Commission sought to hold a union liable for an unfair labor practice, by refusing to work overtime.
Brennan J
held that such matters were to be left to "be controlled by the free play of economic forces".
[308]
While some of these judgments appeared beneficial to unions against hostile state courts or bodies, supportive actions also began to be held preempted. In
Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles
a majority of the
Supreme Court
held that Los Angeles was not entitled to refuse to renew a taxi company's franchise license because the
Teamsters Union
had pressured it not to until a dispute was resolved.
[309]
Most recently in
Chamber of Commerce v. Brown
seven judges on the Supreme Court held that California was preempted from passing a law prohibiting any recipient of state funds either from using money to promote or deter union organizing efforts.
Breyer J
and
Ginsburg J
dissented because the law was simply neutral to the bargaining process.
[310]
State governments may, however, use their funds to procure corporations to do work that are union or labor friendly.
[311]
Collective action
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Strike action
and
Collective action
All workers, like the
Arizona teachers in 2019
, are guaranteed the right to take collective action, including strikes, by
international law
, federal law and most state laws.
[312]
The right of labor to take
collective action
, including the
right to strike
, has been fundamental to
common law
,
[313]
federal law,
[314]
and
international law
for over a century.
[315]
As New York teacher unions argued in the 1960s, "If you can't call a strike you don't have real
collective bargaining
, you have 'collective
begging
.'"
[316]
During the 19th century, many courts upheld the right to strike, but others issued injunctions to frustrate strikes,
[317]
and when the
Sherman Antitrust Act
of 1890 was passed to prohibit business combinations in
restraint of trade
, it was first used against labor unions. This resulted in
Eugene Debs
,
American Railway Union
leader and future
Socialist
Presidential candidate, being imprisoned for taking part in the
Pullman Strike
.
[318]
The Supreme Court persisted in
Loewe v. Lawlor
in imposing damages for strikes under
antitrust law
,
[228]
until Congress passed the
Clayton Act of 1914
. Seen as "the
Magna Carta
of America's workers",
[319]
this proclaimed that all collective action by workers was outside antitrust law under the
Commerce Clause
, because "
labor is not a commodity
or article of commerce". It became fundamental that no antitrust sanctions could be imposed, if "a union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups."
[320]
The same principles entered the founding documents of the
International Labour Organization
in 1919.
[321]
Finally at the end of the
Lochner era
[322]
the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
§157 enshrined the right "to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection" and in §163, the "right to strike".
[323]
Cesar Chavez
organized the
United Farm Workers
and campaigned for
social justice
under the slogan "
Yes we can
" and "
Sí, se puede
".
[324]
Although federal law guarantees the
right to strike
, American
labor unions
face the most severe constraints in the developed world in taking collective action. First, the law constrains the purposes for which strikes are allowed. The
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
only covers "employees" in the private sector, and a variety of state laws attempt to suppress government workers' right to strike, including for teachers,
[325]
police and firefighters, without adequate alternatives to set fair wages.
[326]
Workers have the right to take
protected concerted activity
.
[327]
But
NLRB v. Insurance Agents' International Union
held that although employees refusing to perform part of their jobs in a "partial strike" was not a failure to act in good faith, they could be potentially be discharged: perversely, this encourages workers to conduct an all-out strike instead.
[328]
Second, since 1947 the law made it an "unfair labor practice" for employees to take collective action that is not a "primary strike or primary picketing" against the contractual employer.
[329]
This prohibition on
solidarity action
includes a ban on employees of a subsidiary corporation striking in concert with employees of a parent corporation, employees striking with employees of competitors, against outsourced businesses, or against suppliers.
[330]
However the same standards are not applied to employers: in
NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449
, the Supreme Court held that a group of seven employers were entitled to lock out workers of a union at once, in response to a strike at just one of the employers by the union.
[331]
This said, employees may peacefully persuade customers to boycott any employer or related employer, for instance by giving out handbills.
[332]
Third, a union is bound to act in
good faith
if it has negotiated a collective agreement, unless an employer commits an unfair labor practice. The union must also give 60 days warning before undertaking any strike while a collective agreement is in force.
[333]
An employer must also act in good faith, and an allegation of a violation must be based on "substantial evidence": declining to reply to the
National Labor Relations Board
's attempts to mediate was held to be insubstantial.
[334]
2016 Presidential candidate
Bernie Sanders
joined the
Communication Workers Union
strike against
Verizon
. American workers face serious obstacles to strike action, falling below
international labor law
standards.
The fourth constraint, and most significant, on the right to strike is the lack of protection from unjust discharge. Other countries protect employees from any detriment or discharge for strike action,
[335]
but the Supreme Court held in
NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.
that employees on strike could be replaced by
strikebreakers
, and it was not an unfair labor practice for the employer to refuse to discharge the strikebreakers after the dispute was over.
[336]
This decision is widely condemned as a violation of international law.
[337]
However the Supreme Court further held in
NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.
that the Labor Board cannot order an employer to rehire striking workers,
[338]
and has even held that employers could induce younger employees more senior jobs as a reward for breaking a strike.
[339]
Fifth, the Supreme Court has not consistently upheld the right to free speech and peaceful picketing. In
NLRB v. Electrical Workers
the Supreme Court held that an employer could discharge employees who disparaged an employer's TV broadcasts while a labor dispute was running, on the pretext that the employees' speech had no connection to the dispute.
[340]
On the other hand, the Supreme Court has held there was a right to picket shops that refused to hire African-American workers.
[341]
The Supreme Court declared an Alabama law, which fined and imprisoned a picketer, to be unconstitutional.
[342]
The Supreme Court held unions could write newspaper publications to advocate for pro-labor political candidates.
[343]
It also held a union could distribute political leaflets in non-work areas of the employer's property.
[344]
In all of these rights, however, the remedies available to employees for unfair labor practices are minimal, because employees can still be locked out and the Board cannot order reinstatement in the course of a good faith labor dispute. For this reason, a majority of labor law experts support the laws on collective bargaining and collective action being rewritten from a clean slate.
[345]

In 1980 the
United Auto Workers
collectively agreed
Chrysler Corp
employees would be on the board of directors, but despite experiments, today asset managers monopolize voting rights in corporations with "

".
[348]
While
collective bargaining
was stalled by
US Supreme Court
preemption
policy, a dysfunctional
National Labor Relations Board
, and falling
union membership rate
since the
Taft-Hartley Act
of 1947, employees have demanded direct voting rights at work: for corporate
boards of directors
, and in
work councils
that bind management.
[349]
This has become an important complement to both strengthening
collective bargaining
, and securing the votes in labor's capital on
pension
boards, which buy and vote on
corporate stocks
, and control employers.
[350]
Labor law has increasingly converged with
corporate law
,
[351]
and in 2018 the first federal law, the
Reward Work Act
was proposed by three US senators to enable employees to vote for one third of the directors on boards of listed companies.
[352]
In 1919, under the Republican governor
Calvin Coolidge
,
Massachusetts
became the first state with a right for employees in manufacturing companies to have employee representatives on the board of directors, but only if corporate stockholders voluntarily agreed.
[353]
Also in 1919 both
Procter & Gamble
and the General Ice Delivery Company of Detroit had employee representation on boards.
[354]
Board representation for employees spread through the 1920s, many without requiring any
employee stock ownership plan

[355]
In the early 20th century, labor law theory split between those who advocated collective bargaining backed by strike action, those who advocated a greater role for binding arbitration,
[356]
and proponents of codetermination as "
industrial democracy
".
[357]
Today, these methods are seen as complements, not alternatives. A majority of countries in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
have laws requiring direct participation rights.
[358]
In 1994, the
Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report
examined law reform to improve collective labor relations, and suggested minor amendments to encourage worker involvement.
[359]
Congressional division prevented federal reform, but labor unions and state legislatures have experimented.
... while there are many contributing causes to unrest ... one cause ... is fundamental. That is the necessary conflict—the contrast between our political
liberty
and our industrial
absolutism
. We are as free politically, perhaps, as free as it is possible for us to be. ... On the other hand, in dealing with industrial problems, the position of the ordinary worker is exactly the reverse. The individual employee has no effective voice or
vote
. And the main objection, as I see it, to the very large corporation is, that it makes possible—and in many cases makes inevitable—the exercise of industrial
absolutism
. ... The
social justice
for which we are striving is an incident of our democracy, not its main end ... the end for which we must strive is the attainment of rule by the people, and that involves
industrial democracy
as well as political democracy.

Commission on Industrial Relations

Corporations
are chartered under state law, the larger mostly in
Delaware
, but leave investors free to organize voting rights and board representation as they choose.
[360]
Because of
unequal bargaining power
, but also because of historic caution among American labor unions about taking on management,
[361]
shareholders have come to monopolize voting rights in American corporations. From the 1970s employees and unions sought representation on company boards. This could happen through
collective agreements
, as it historically occurred in Germany or other countries, or through employees demanding further representation through
employee stock ownership plans
, but they aimed for voice independent from capital risks that could not be
diversified
. By 1980, workers had attempted to secure board representation at corporations including
United Airlines
, the
General Tire and Rubber Company
, and the
Providence and Worcester Railroad
.
[362]
However, in 1974 the
Securities and Exchange Commission
, run by appointees of
Richard Nixon
, had rejected that employees who held shares in
AT&T
were entitled to make shareholder proposals to include employee representatives on the board of directors.
[363]
This position was eventually reversed expressly by the
Dodd-Frank Act
of 2010 §971, which subject to rules by the
Securities and Exchange Commission
entitles shareholders to put forward nominations for the board.
[364]
Instead of pursuing board seats through shareholder resolutions the
United Auto Workers
, for example, successfully sought board representation by collective agreement at
Chrysler
in 1980.
[365]
The
United Steel Workers
secured board representation in five corporations in 1993.
[366]
Some representation plans were linked to
employee stock ownership plans
, and were open to abuse. At the energy company,
Enron
, workers were encouraged by management to invest an average of 62.5 per cent of their retirement savings from
401(k)
plans in Enron stock against basic principles of prudent,
diversified investment
, and had no board representation. When Enron collapsed in 2003, employees lost a majority of their pension savings.
[367]
For this reason, employees and unions have sought representation because they invest their labor in the firm, and do not want undiversifiable capital risk. Empirical research suggests by 1999 there were at least 35 major employee representation plans with
worker directors
, though often linked to corporate stock.
[368]
Powered by a
solar farm
,
[369]
the
Volkswagen
plant at
Chattanooga, Tennessee
has debated introducing
work councils
to give employees and its labor union more of a voice at work.
As well as representation on a corporation's board of directors, or top management, employees have sought binding rights (for instance, over working time, break arrangement, and layoffs) in their organizations through elected
work councils
. After the
National War Labor Board
was established by the
Woodrow Wilson
administration, firms established work councils with some rights throughout the 1920s.
[370]
Frequently, however, management refused to concede the "right to employ and discharge, the direction of the working forces, and the management of the business" in any way,
[371]
which from the workforce perspective defeated the object. As the US presidency changed to the
Republican party
during the 1920s, work "councils" were often instituted by employers that did not have free elections or proceedings, to forestall independent labor unions' right to collective bargaining. For this reason, the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
§158(a)(2) ensured it was an
unfair labor practice
for an employer "to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization, or contribute financial or other support to it".
[372]
This was designed to enable free work councils, genuinely independent from management, but not dominated work councils or so called "
company unions
".
[373]
For example, a
work council
law was passed by the US government in
Allied-occupied Germany
called
Control Council Law, No 22
. This empowered German workers to organize work councils if elected by democratic methods, with secret ballots, using participation of free labor unions, with basic functions ranging from how to apply
collective agreements
, regulating health and safety, rules for engagements, dismissals and grievances, proposals for improving work methods, and organizing social and welfare facilities.
[374]
These rules were subsequently updated and adopted in German law, although American employees themselves did not yet develop a practice of bargaining for work councils, nor did states implement work council rules, even though neither were
preempted
by the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
.
[375]
In 1992, the
National Labor Relations Board
in its
Electromation, Inc
,
[376]
and
EI du Pont de Nemours
,
[377]
decisions confirmed that while management dominated councils were unlawful, genuine and independent work councils would not be. The
Dunlop Report
in 1994 produced an inconclusive discussion that favored experimentation with work councils.
[378]
A
Republican
Congress did propose a
Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995
to repeal §158(a)(2), but this was vetoed by President
Bill Clinton
as it would have enabled management dominated unions and councils. In 2014, workers at the
Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant
, in
Chattanooga, Tennessee
, sought to establish a
work council
. This was initially supported by management, but its stance changed in 2016, after the
United Auto Workers
succeeded in winning a ballot for traditional representation in an exclusive
bargaining unit
.
[379]
As it stands, employees have no widespread right to vote in American workplaces, which has increased the gap between
political democracy
and traditional labor law goals of
workplace
and
economic democracy
.
Equality and discrimination
[
edit
]
See also:
US employment discrimination law
,
European labour law
, and
UK employment discrimination law
The world's first general equality law, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
, followed the
March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
in 1963. The head of the movement,
Martin Luther King Jr.
told America, "
I have a dream
that one day ... little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."
Since the
US Declaration of Independence
in 1776 proclaimed that "all men are created equal",
[380]
the
Constitution
was progressively amended, and legislation was written, to spread equal rights to all people. While the
right to vote
was needed for true political participation, the "
right to work
" and "free choice of employment" came to be seen as necessary for "
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness
".
[381]
After state laws experimented, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
's
Executive Order 8802
in 1941 set up the
Fair Employment Practice Committee
to ban discrimination by "race, creed, color or national origin" in the defense industry. The first comprehensive statutes were the
Equal Pay Act of 1963
, to limit discrimination by employers between men and women, and the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
, to stop discrimination based on "
race
, color,
religion
, sex, or national origin."
[382]
In the following years, more "protected characteristics" were added by state and federal acts. The
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
protects people over age 40. The
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
requires "reasonable accommodation" to
include
people with disabilities in the workforce. Twenty two state Acts protect people based on
sexual orientation
in public and private employment, but
proposed federal laws
have been blocked by
Republican
opposition. There can be no detriment to
union members
, or people who have
served in the military
. In principle, states may require rights and remedies for employees that go beyond the federal minimum. Federal law has multiple exceptions, but generally requires no
disparate treatment
by employing entities, no
disparate impact
of formally neutral measures, and enables employers to voluntarily take
affirmative action
favoring under-represented people in their workforce.
[383]
The law has not, however, succeeded in eliminating the disparities in income by
race
, health, age or socio-economic background.
Constitutional rights
[
edit
]
See also:
Equal opportunity
and
Discrimination
The right to equality in employment in the United States comes from at least six major statutes, and limited jurisprudence of the
US Supreme Court
, leaving the law inconsistent and full of exceptions. Originally, the
US Constitution
entrenched gender, race and wealth inequality by enabling states to maintain
slavery
,
[384]
reserve the vote to white, property owning men,
[385]
and enabling employers to refuse employment to anyone. After the
Emancipation Proclamation
in the
American Civil War
, the
Thirteenth
,
Fourteenth
and
Fifteenth
Amendments attempted to enshrined equal civil rights for everyone,
[386]
while the
Civil Rights Act of 1866
,
[387]
and
1875
spelled out that everyone had the right to make contracts, hold
property
and access accommodation, transport and entertainment without discrimination. However, in 1883 the
US Supreme Court
in the
Civil Rights Cases
put an end to development by declaring that
Congress
was not allowed to regulate the actions of private individuals rather than public bodies.
[388]
In his dissent,
Harlan J
would have held that no "corporation or individual wielding power under state authority for the public benefit" was entitled to "discriminate against freemen or citizens, in their civil rights".
[389]
A constitutional right to equality, based on the
Equal Protection Clauses
of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments has been disputed. 125 years after
Harlan J
wrote his famous dissent that all social institutions should be bound to equal rights,
[390]
Barack Obama
won election for President.
By 1944, the position had changed. In
Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railway Co.
,
[391]
a Supreme Court majority held a labor union had a
duty of fair representation
and may not discriminate against members based on race under the
Railway Labor Act
of 1926 (or the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935
.
Murphy J
would have also based the duty on a
right to equality
in the
Fifth Amendment
). Subsequently,
Johnson v. Railway Express Agency
admitted that the old
Enforcement Act of 1870
provided a remedy against private parties.
[392]
However, the Courts have not yet accepted a general right of equality, regardless of public or private power. Legislation will usually be found unconstitutional, under the
Fifth
or
Fourteenth Amendment
if discrimination is shown to be intentional,
[393]
or if it irrationally discriminates against one group. For example, in
Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur
the Supreme Court held by a majority of 5 to 2, that a school's requirement for women teachers to take mandatory maternity leave was unconstitutional, against the
Due Process Clause
, because it could not plausibly be shown that after child birth women could never perform a job.
[394]
But while the
US Supreme Court
has failed, against dissent, to recognize a constitutional principle of equality,
[395]
federal and state legislation contains the stronger rules. In principle, federal equality law always enables state law to create better rights and remedies for employees.
[396]
Equal treatment
[
edit
]
See also:
Disparate treatment
,
Bona fide occupational qualification
,
Harassment
,
US workplace sexual harassment
, and
Retaliation (law)
Today legislation bans discrimination, that is unrelated to an employee's ability to do a job, based on sex, race,
[397]
ethnicity, national origin, age and disability.
[398]
The
Equal Pay Act of 1963
banned gender pay discrimination, amending the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
. Plaintiffs must show an employing entity pays them less than someone of the opposite sex in an "establishment" for work of "equal skill, effort, or responsibility" under "similar working conditions". Employing entities may raise a defense that pay differences result from a seniority or merit system unrelated to sex.
[399]
For example, in
Corning Glass Works v. Brennan
the Supreme Court held that although women plaintiffs worked at different times in the day, compared to male colleagues, the working conditions were "sufficiently similar" and the claim was allowed.
[400]
One drawback is the equal pay provisions are subject to multiple exemptions for groups of employees found in the
FLSA 1938
itself. Another is that equal pay rules only operate within workers of an "enterprise",
[401]
so that it has no effect upon high paying enterprises being more male dominated, nor
child care
being unequally shared between men and women that affects long-term career progression. Sex discrimination includes discrimination based on pregnancy,
[402]
and is prohibited in general by the landmark
Civil Rights Act of 1964
.
[403]
Rosie the Riveter
symbolized women factory workers in World War II. The
Equal Pay Act of 1963
banned pay discrimination within workplaces.
[404]
Beyond gender equality on the specific issue of pay, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
is the general anti-discrimination statute. Titles I to VI protects the equal right to vote, to access public accommodations, public services, schools, it strengthens the
Civil Rights Commission
, and requires equality in federally funded agencies.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
bans discrimination in employment. Under §2000e-2, employers must not refuse to hire, discharge or discriminate "against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual's
race
, color, religion, sex, or
national origin
."
[405]
Segregation
in employment is equally unlawful.
[406]
The same basic rules apply for people
over 40 years old
,
[407]
and for people with
disabilities
.
[408]
Although states may go further, a significant limit to federal law is a duty only falls on private employers of more than 15 staff, or 20 staff for age discrimination.
[409]
Within these limits, people can bring claims against
disparate treatment
. In
Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine
the
US Supreme Court
held plaintiffs will establish a
prima facie
case of discrimination for not being hired if they are in a protected group, qualified for a job, but the job is given to someone of a different group. It is then up to an employer to rebut the case, by showing a legitimate reason for not hiring the plaintiff.
[410]
However, in 1993, this position was altered in
St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks
where
Scalia J
held (over the dissent of four justices) that if an employer shows no discriminatory intent, an employee must not only show the reason is a pretext, but show additional evidence that discrimination has taken place.
[411]
Souter J
in dissent, pointed out the majority's approach was "inexplicable in forgiving employers who present false evidence in court".
[412]
Disparate treatment can be justified under
CRA 1964
§2000e-2(e) if an employer shows selecting someone reflects by "religion, sex, or national origin is a
bona fide occupational qualification
reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise."
[413]
Race is not included. For example, in
Dothard v. Rawlinson
the state of
Alabama
prohibited women from working as prison guards in "contact" jobs, with close proximity to prisoners. It also had minimum height and weight requirements (5"2 and 120
lbs
), which it argued were necessary for proper security. Ms Rawlinson claimed both requirements were unlawful discrimination. A majority of 6 to 3 held that the gender restrictions in contact jobs were a
bona fide occupational qualification
, because there was a heightened risk of sexual assault, although
Stewart J
suggested the result might have differed if the prisons were better run. A majority held the height and weight restrictions, while neutral, had a
disparate impact
on women and were not justified by business necessity.
[414]
By contrast, in
Wilson v. Southwest Airlines Co.
, a
Texas
District Court held an airline was not entitled to require women only to work as cabin attendants (who were further required to be "dressed in high boots and hot-pants") even if it could show a consumer preference. The essence of the business was transporting passengers, rather than its advertising metaphor of "spreading love all over Texas", so that there was no "bona fide occupational requirement".
[415]
Under the
ADEA 1967
, age requirements can be used, but only if reasonably necessary, or compelled by law or circumstance. For example, in
Western Air Lines, Inc v. Criswell
the Supreme Court held that airlines could require pilots to retire at age 60, because the
Federal Aviation Administration
required this. It could not, however, refuse to employ flight engineers over 60 because there was no comparable FAA rule.
[416]
We are confronted by powerful forces telling us to rely on the good will and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us. They deplore our discontent, they resent our will to organize, so that we may guarantee that
humanity
will prevail and
equality
will be exacted. They are shocked that action organizations, sit-ins,
civil disobedience
, and protests are becoming our everyday tools, just as strikes, demonstrations and union organization became yours to insure that
bargaining power
genuinely existed on both sides of the table. ...

(11 December 1961)
In addition to prohibitions on discriminatory treatment,
harassment
, and detriment in retaliation for asserting rights, is prohibited. In a particularly obscene case,
Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson
the Supreme Court unanimously held that a bank manager who coerced a woman employee into having sex with him 40 to 50 times, including rape on multiple occasions, had committed unlawful harassment within the meaning of
42 USC
§2000e.
[417]
But also if employees or managers create a "hostile or offensive working environment", this counts as discrimination. In
Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.
the Court held that a "hostile environment" did not have to "seriously affect employees' psychological well-being" to be unlawful. If the environment "would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive" this is enough.
[418]
Standard principles of agency and vicariously liability apply, so an employer is responsible for the actions of its agents,
[419]
But according to
Faragher v. City of Boca Raton
an employing entity can avoid vicarious liability if it shows it (a) exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and (b) a plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of opportunities to stop it.
[420]
In addition, an employing entity may not retaliate against an employee for asserting his or her rights under the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
,
[421]
or the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
.
[422]
In
University of Pennsylvania v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
, the Supreme Court held that a university was not entitled to refuse to give up peer review assessment documents in order for the
EEOC
to investigate the claim.
[423]
Furthermore, in
Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.
the Supreme Court held that writing a negative job reference, after a plaintiff brought a race discrimination claim, was unlawful retaliation: employees were protected even if they had been fired.
[424]
It has also been held that simply being reassigned to a slightly different job, operating forklifts, after making a sex discrimination complaint could amount to unlawful retaliation.
[425]
This is all seen as necessary to make equal rights effective.
Equal impact and remedies
[
edit
]
See also:
Disparate impact
In addition to
disparate treatment
, employing entities may not use practices having an unjustified
disparate impact
on protected groups. In
Griggs v. Duke Power Co.
, a power company on the
Dan River
,
North Carolina
, required a
high school diploma
for staff to transfer to higher paying non-manual jobs. Because of
racial segregation
in states like
North Carolina
, fewer
black employees
than
white employees
had diplomas.
[426]
The Court found a diploma was wholly unnecessary to perform the tasks in higher paying non-manual jobs.
Burger CJ
, for a unanimous
Supreme Court
, held the "
Act
proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation." An employer could show that a practice with
disparate impact
followed "business necessity" that was "related to
job performance
" but otherwise such practices would be prohibited.
[427]
It is not necessary to show any intention to discriminate, just a discriminatory effect. Since amendments by the
Civil Rights Act of 1991
,
[428]
if
disparate impact
is shown the law requires employers "to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity" and that any non-discriminatory "alternative employment practice" is not feasible.
[429]
On the other hand, in
Ricci v. DeStefano
five Supreme Court judges held the
City of New Haven
had acted unlawfully by discarding test results for
firefighters
, which it concluded could have had an unjustified
disparate impact
by race.
[430]
In a further concurrence,
Scalia J
said "resolution of this dispute merely postpones the
evil
day" when a
disparate impact
might be found
unconstitutional
, against the [[Equal
Protection Clause]] because, in his view, the lack of a good faith defense meant employers were compelled to do "racial decision making" that "is ... discriminatory." In dissent,
Ginsburg J
pointed out that
disparate impact
theory advances equality, and in no way requires behavior that is not geared to identifying people with skills necessary for jobs.
[431]
The
Paycheck Fairness Act
, repeatedly proposed by Democrats such as
Hillary Clinton
, would prevent employer defenses to sex discrimination that are related to gender. It has been rejected by
Republicans
in the
United States Congress
.
Both
disparate treatment
and disparate impact claims may be brought by an individual, or if there is a "pattern or practice" by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
, the
Attorney General
,
[432]
and by
class action
. Under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
, Rule 23 a class of people who share a common claim must be numerous, have "questions of law or fact common to the class", have representatives typical of the claimants, who would "fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class".
[433]
Class actions may be brought, even in favor of people who are not already identified, for instance, if they have been discouraged from applying for jobs,
[434]
so long as there is sufficiently specific presentation of issues of law and fact to certify the action.
[435]
A significant practical problem for disparate impact claims is the "
Bennett Amendment
" in the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
§703(h). Though introduced as a supposedly "technical" amendment by a Utah Republican Senator, it requires that claims for equal pay between men and women cannot be brought unless they fulfill the requirements of the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
§ 206(d)(1).
[436]
This says that employers have a defense to employee claims if unequal pay (purely based on gender) flows from "(i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex." By contrast, for claims alleging discriminatory pay on grounds of race, age, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics, an employer only has the more restricted defenses available in the
CRA 1964
§703(h).
[437]
In
County of Washington v. Gunther
[438]
the majority of the Supreme Court accepted that this was the correct definition. In principle, this meant that a group of women prison guards, who did less time working with prisoners than men guards, and also did different clerical work, would be able to bring a claim—there was no need to be doing entirely "equal work". However
Rehnquist J
dissented, arguing the Amendment should have put the plaintiffs in an even worse position: they should be required to prove they do "equal work", as is stated in the first part of §703(h).
[439]
Nevertheless, the majority held that the gender pay provisions could be worse because, for example, an employer could apply ""a bona fide job rating system," so long as it does not discriminate on the basis of sex", whereas the same would not be possible for other claims under the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
. Given that a significant
gender pay gap
remains, it is not clear why any discrepancy or less favorable treatment, should remain at all.

Job security

Main articles:
Job security
and
Full employment
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
brought
unemployment
down from over 20% to under 2%, with the
New Deal
's investment in jobs during the
Great Depression
.
Job security laws in the United States are the weakest in the developed world, as there are no federal statutory rights yet.
[441]
Any employment contract can require job security, but employees other than corporate executives or managers rarely have the
bargaining power
to contract for job security.
[442]
Collective agreements often aim to ensure that employees can only be terminated for a "
just cause
", but the vast majority of Americans have no protection other than the rules at common law. Most states follow a rule that an employee can be terminated "
at will
" by the employer: for a "good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all", so long as no statutory rule is violated.
[443]
Most states have public policy exceptions to ensure that an employee's discharge does not frustrate the purpose of statutory rights. Although the
Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912
required that federal civil servants cannot be dismissed except for a "just cause", no federal or state law (outside Montana
[444]
) protects all employees yet. There are now a growing number of proposals to do this.
[445]
There are no rights to be given reasonable notice before termination, apart from whatever is stated in a contract or collective agreement, and no requirements for
severance pay
if an employer lays off employees for economic reasons. The only exception is that the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
requires 60 days notice is given if a business with over 100 employees lays off over 33% of its workforce or over 500 people. While a minority of theorists defend at will employment on the ground that it protects liberty and economic efficiency,
[446]
the empirical evidence suggests that job insecurity hampers innovation, reduces productivity, worsens economic recessions,
[447]
deprives employees of liberty and pay,
[448]
and creates a culture of fear.
[449]
US unemployment has historically been extremely volatile, as Republican presidents have consistently increased post-war unemployment, while Democratic presidents have reduced it.
[450]

In its conduct of
monetary policy
, it is the duty of the
Federal Reserve
to achieve "maximum employment",
[451]
although in reality Federal Reserve chairs prioritize the reducing of inflation.
Underemployment
from growing insecurity of working hours has risen. Government may also use
fiscal policy
(by taxing or borrowing and spending) to achieve full employment, but as unemployment affects the power of workers, and wages, this remains highly political.
[452]
Termination and cause
[
edit
]
See also:
Wrongful termination
,
Unfair dismissal
,
At-will employment
, and
Termination of employment
The reasons or "causes" that an employer can give to terminate employment affect everything from people's income, to the ability to pay the rent, to getting health insurance. Despite this, the legal right to have one's job terminated only for a "just cause" is confined to just three groups of people. First, in the
Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912
Congress codified executive orders giving federal civil servants the right to have their jobs terminated "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service."
[453]
Second, in the mid 20th century, courts in New York developed a rule that corporate directors could only be dismissed for a "just cause", requiring reasons related to the director's conduct, competence, or some economic justification.
[454]
Third, since 1987,
Montana
has enacted a "wrongful discharge" law, giving employees the right to damages if "discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer's probationary period of employment", with a standard probation set at 6 months work.
[444]
However a right to reasons before termination has never been extended to ordinary employees outside Montana. By contrast, almost all other developed countries have legislation requiring just cause in termination.
[455]
The standard in the
International Labour Organization
Termination of Employment Convention, 1982
requires a "valid reason" for termination of a worker contract based on "capacity or conduct" and prohibits reasons related to union membership, being a worker representative, or a protected characteristic (e.g. race, gender, etc.). It also requires reasonable notice, a fair procedure, and a
severance allowance
if the termination is for economic reasons.
[456]
Some countries such as Germany also require that elected
work councils
have the power to veto or delay terminations, to neutralize the employer's potential
conflicts of interest
.
[457]
Most countries treat job security as a fundamental right,
[458]
as well as necessary to prevent irrational job losses, to reduce unemployment, and to promote innovation.
[447]
An alternative view is that making it easier to fire people encourages employers to hire more people because they will not fear the costs of litigation,
[446]
although the empirical credibility of this argument is doubted by a majority of scholars.
[459]
The slogan "you're fired!" was popularized by
Donald Trump
's TV show,
The Apprentice
before he became president. This reflects the "
at will employment
" doctrine that deprives employees of job security, and lets people become unemployed for arbitrary reasons.
Because most states have not yet enacted proposals for job security rights,
[460]
the default rule is known as "
at-will employment
". For example, in 1872, the
California Civil Code
was written to say "employment having no specified term may be terminated at the will of either party", and even employment for a specified term could be terminated by the employer for a wilful breach, neglect of duty or the employee's incapacity.
[461]
In the late 19th century, employment at will was popularized by academic writers as an inflexible legal presumption,
[462]
and state courts began to adopt it, even though many had presumed that contract termination usually required notice and justifications.
[463]
By the mid-20th century this was summed up to say that an employee's job could be terminated for a "good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all".
[443]
However, the employer's discretion to terminate could not violate any statutory prohibition, including termination for union membership,
[464]
discriminatory termination based on a protected characteristic (e.g. race, gender, age or disability),
[465]
and bringing claims for occupational health and safety,
[466]
fair labor standards,
[467]
retirement income,
[468]
family and medical leave,
[469]
and under a series of other specific Acts.
[470]
Many state courts also added at least four "
public policy
" exceptions,
[471]
to ensure that the purpose of statutes in general would not be frustrated by firing. First, employees will be wrongfully discharged if are discharged after they refused to act unlawfully, for instance for refusing to perjure themselves in court.
[472]
Second, employees cannot be terminated if they insist on performing public duties such as serving on a jury or responding to a subpoena even if this affects an employer's business.
[473]
Third, an employee cannot be discharged for exercising any statutory right, such as refusing to take a lie detector test or filing litigation.
[474]
Fourth, employees will be wrongfully discharged if they legitimately
blow the whistle
on unlawful employer conduct, such as violating food labelling laws,
[475]
or reporting unlawful standards in a nursing home.
[476]
However none of these exceptions limit the central problem of terminations by an employer that are unrelated to an employee's conduct, capability, or business efficiency.
[477]
Some states interpret the general duty of
good faith
in contracts to cover discharges,
[478]
so that an employee cannot, for example, be terminated just before a bonus is due to be paid.
[479]
However the vast majority of Americans remain unprotected against most arbitrary, irrational or malicious conduct by employers.
[480]
Despite the default, and absence of job security rights in statute, a contract may require reasons before dismissal as a matter of construction. When there is a "just cause" term in a contract, courts generally interpret this to enable termination for an employee's inadequate job performance after fair warning,
[481]
and job-related misconduct where the employer consistently enforces a rule,
[482]
but not actions outside of the job.
[483]
An employee's job may be constructively and wrongfully terminated if an employer's behavior objectively shows it no longer wishes to be bound by the contract, for instance by unfairly depriving an employee of responsibility.
[484]
If a written contract does not promise "just cause" protection against termination, statements in a handbook can still be enforceable,
[485]
and oral agreements can override the written contract.
[486]
Economic layoffs
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Layoff
and
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
Many job terminations in America are economic
layoffs
, where employers believe that employees are redundant. In most countries, economic layoffs are separately regulated because of the
conflicts of interest
between workers, management and shareholders, and the risk that workers are discharged to boost profits even if this damages the long-term sustainability of enterprise. The
ILO
Termination of Employment Convention, 1982
requires a
severance allowance
if the termination is for economic reasons, as well as consultation with worker representatives about ways to avoid layoffs.
[456]
Most developed countries regard information and consultation in the event of any economic change as a fundamental right.
[487]
The United States government also helped write
Control Council Law No 22
for post-war Germany which enabled unions to collectively bargain for elected work councils, which would have the right to participate in decisions about dismissals.
[488]
However, there are no state or federal laws requiring severance pay or employee participation in layoff decisions. Where employment contracts or collective agreements contain "just cause" provisions, these have been interpreted to give employers broad discretion,
[489]
and immunity from the social consequences for the laid off workforce.
American workers do not yet have a right to vote on employer layoff decisions, even though the US government helped draft laws for other countries to have elected work councils.
[490]
The only statutory right for employees is for extreme cases of mass layoffs under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
. The
WARN Act
regulates any "plant closing" where there is an "employment loss" of 33% of employees if that is over 50 employees, or any case of over 500 employee layoffs, and the business employs 100 persons or more.
[491]
In these cases, employers have to give 60 days notice to employee representatives such as a union, or to each employee if they have none, and the State.
[492]
Employment loss is defined to include reduction of over 50% of working time, but exclude cases where an employee is offered a suitable alternative job within reasonable commuting distance.
[493]
Despite the absence of any duty to consult, employers can argue three main defenses for failure to give notice of mass layoff. First, an employer can argue that they believed in good faith that less notice was necessary to improve chances of a capital injection.
[494]
Second, an employer may argue that business circumstances were unforeseen.
[495]
Third, an employer can argue it had reasonable grounds for believing its failure was not a violation of the Act.
[496]
The only remedies are pay that would have been due in the notice period, and a $500 a day penalty to the local governments that were not notified.
[497]
States such as Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine have statutes with slightly more stringent notice requirements, but none yet require real voice for employees before facing economic hardship.
A common cause of layoffs is that businesses are merged or taken over, either through stock market acquisitions or private equity transactions, where new managements want to fire parts of the workforce to augment profits for shareholders.
[498]
Outside limited defenses in
corporate law
,
[499]
this issue is largely unregulated. However, if an employer is under a duty to bargain in good faith with a union, and its business is transferred, there will be a duty on the successor employer to continue bargaining if it has retained a substantial number of the previous workforce. This was not made out in the leading case,
Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Local Joint Executive Board
, where the new owner of a restaurant and motor lodge business retained 9 out of 53 former employees, but hired 45 new staff of its own.
[500]
The majority held there must be "substantial continuity of identity" of the business for the good faith bargaining duty to continue.
Full employment
[

Main articles:
Unemployment in the United States
,
Job guarantee
, and
Full employment
The right to
full employment
or the "
right to work
" in a fair paying job is a universal human right in
international law
,
[501]
partly inspired by the experience of the
New Deal
in the 1930s.
[502]
Unemployment
has, however, remained politically divisive because it affects the distribution of wealth and power. When there is full employment under 2%, and everyone can easily find new jobs, worker
bargaining power
tends to be higher and pay tends to rise, but high unemployment tends to reduce worker power and pay,
[503]
and may increase shareholder profit. It was long acknowledged that the law should ensure nobody is denied a job by unreasonable restrictions by the state or private parties, and the Supreme Court said in
Truax v. Raich
that "the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity".
[504]
During the
New Deal
with unemployment having reached 20% after the
Wall Street Crash of 1929
, the
Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935
empowered the President to create the
Works Progress Administration
, which aimed to directly employ people on fair wages.
[505]
By 1938, the
WPA
employed 3.33 million people, and built streets, bridges and buildings across the country. Also created by the 1935 Act, the
Rural Electrification Administration
brought electrification of farms from 11% in 1934 to 50% by 1942, and nearly 100% by 1949. After war production brought full employment, the WPA was wound up in 1943.
Unemployment
since World War I has been lower under Democratic presidents and higher under Republican presidents. The high rate of
incarceration
raised real unemployment by around 1.5% since 1980.
[506]
After World War II, the
Employment Act of 1946
declared a policy of Congress to "promote full employment and production, increased real income... and reasonable price stability".
[507]
However the Act did not follow the original proposal to say "all Americans... are entitled to an opportunity for useful, remunerative, regular, and full-time employment".
[508]
By the 1970s, there was a growing opinion that the
Equal Protection Clause
itself in the
14th Amendment
should also mean that "every citizen who applies for a government job is entitled to it unless the government can establish some reason for denying the employment."
[509]
The
Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act
of 1978 was passed and enabled the President to create jobs to maintain full employment: it stated "the President shall, as may be authorized by law, establish reservoirs of public employment and private nonprofit employment projects".
[510]
The Act sets the goal of federal government to ensure unemployment is below "3 per centum among individuals aged twenty and over" with inflation also under 3 per cent.
[511]
It includes "policy priorities" of the "development of energy sources and supplies, transportation, and environmental improvement".
[512]
These powers of a
job guarantee
, full employment, and environmental improvement have not yet been used.
[513]
The
Works Progress Administration
from 1935 to 1943,
[514]
created 8.5m jobs spending $1.3bn a year to get out of the
Great Depression
.
While the laws for a federal or state
job guarantee
have not yet been used, the
Federal Reserve Act
1913 does require that the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System
should use its powers "to promote effectively the goals of
maximum employment
, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
[515]
During the Great Depression it was understood that inequality in the distribution of wealth had contributed to the lack of employment, and that Federal lending policy and bank regulation should pursue a range of objectives.
[516]
However, the Federal Reserve became dominated by a theory of a
natural rate of unemployment
, taking the view that attempts to achieve full employment would accelerate inflation to an uncontrollably high. Instead it was said by theorists such as
Milton Friedman
that central banks should use monetary policy only to control inflation, according to the
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment
(NAIRU).
[517]
It is doubted that any natural rate of unemployment exists, because the United States and other countries have sustained full employment with low inflation before,
[518]
and the US unemployment rate follows which political party is in the White House.
[519]
... my friends, after this
war
, there will be a great
unemployment
problem. The munition plants will be closed and useless, and millions of munitions workers will be thrown out upon the market... First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. And that is what is going to happen to the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America
. And I say, courage to the strikers, and courage to the delegates, because great times are coming, stressful days are here, and I hope your hearts will be strong, and I hope you will be one hundred per cent union when it comes!

Biennial Convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America
(
)
If despite fiscal and monetary policy people are unemployed, the Social Security Act of 1935 creates
unemployment insurance
.
[520]
One of its goals is to stabilize employment by encouraging employers to retain workers in downturns. Unlike other systems, this makes social security highly dependent on employers. It is funded through a federal payroll tax, and employers that make more layoffs pay higher rates based on past experience. A laid off employee brings a claim to state unemployment office, the former employer is informed and may contest whether the employee was laid off fairly: they are given absolute privilege to communicate information regardless of how false or defamatory it is.
[521]
Employees cannot get benefits if they are laid off for misconduct,
[522]
and for participation in strikes,
[523]
even though the reality may be the employer's fault and there are no other jobs available. Social security claimants must also accept any suitable job.
[524]
Unemployment offices usually provide facilities for claimants to search for work, but many also turn to private employment agencies. The Supreme Court has held that licensing, fees and regulation of employment agencies under state law is constitutional.

Three potential views are:
(1) expansion of trade is good because it increases the scope for
division of labor
and expanding markets. So, all customs, taxes, and equivalent restrictions against
market access
should be dismantled
(2) free trade is bad because it exacerbates labor's inequality of bargaining power against global capital. Trade should be limited and regulated by systems of taxes and tariffs according to the state of other countries' development
(3) trade, without barriers to movement of capital, goods and services, improves living standards if labor standards are improved in all countries. This (a) discourages emigration from poorer countries: as people's lives improve they may not want to leave (b) requires standards are improved at a rate to ensure stability in capital and labor flows (c) in turn requires that standard should not enable workers to be paid less than is necessary for
human development

of 1980 gave the division its own
Department of Fair Employment and Housing
, with the stated purpose of protecting citizens against

employment discrimination
on the basis of:
[528]
age, ancestry, color, creed, denial of family and medical care leave, disability (including HIV/AIDS), marital status, medical condition, national origin, race, religion, sex, transgender status and sexual orientation.
Sexual orientation
was not specifically included in the original law but precedent was established based on
case law
. On October 9, 2011, California Governor Edmund G. "Jerry" Brown signed into law Assembly Bill No. 887 alters the meaning of gender for the purposes of discrimination laws that define sex as including gender so that California law now prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression.
[529]
The state also has its own labor law covering agricultural workers, the

In 1945, New Jersey enacted the first statewide civil rights act in the entire nation. with the purpose of protecting citizens against

[530]
This has since been expanded to age, sex, disability, pregnancy, sexual orientation, perceived sexual orientation, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, military service, or mental or physical disability, AIDS and HIV related illnesses and atypical hereditary cellular or blood traits.

Supposition or system of ideas intended to explain something
For theories in science, see
Scientific theory
. For other uses, see
Theory (disambiguation)
.
A
theory
is a
rational
type of
abstract thinking
about a
phenomenon
, or the results of such thinking. The process of contemplative and rational thinking is often associated with such processes as
observational study
or research. Theories may be
scientific
, belong to a non-scientific discipline, or no discipline at all. Depending on the context, a theory's assertions might, for example, include generalized explanations of how
nature
works. The word has its roots in
ancient Greek
, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.
In modern science, the term "theory" refers to
scientific theories
, a well-confirmed type of explanation of
nature
, made in a way
consistent
with the
scientific method
, and fulfilling the
criteria
required by
modern science
. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide
empirical
support for it, or
empirical
contradiction ("
falsify
") of it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,
[1]
in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word
hypothesis
).
[2]
Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically
testable
conjectures
, and from
scientific laws
, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions.
Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.
[3]
: 131
A theory can be a
body of knowledge
, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory
models
. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.
[4]

The word theory or "in theory" is sometimes used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or test before.
[5]
In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another
concept
, a
hypothesis
. Instead of using the word "hypothetically", it is replaced by a phrase: "in theory". In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it "just a theory" (implying that the idea has not even been tested).
[6]
Hence, that word "theory" is very often contrasted to "
practice
" (from Greek
praxis
, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for
doing
, which is opposed to theory.
[6]
A "classical example" of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine:
medical theory
involves trying to understand the
causes
and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.
[a]
Ancient usage
[
edit
]
The English word
theory
derives from a technical term in philosophy in
Ancient Greek
. As an everyday word,
theoria
,
θεωρία
, meant "looking at, viewing, beholding", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to
contemplative
or
speculative
understandings of
natural things
, such as those of
natural philosophers
, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans.
[b]
English-speakers have used the word
theory
since at least the late 16th century.
[7]
Modern uses of the word
theory
derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and
rational
explanation of the general
nature
of things.
Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word
θεωρία
apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the
Greek language
. In the book
From Religion to Philosophy
,
Francis Cornford
suggests that the
Orphics
used the word
theoria
to mean "passionate sympathetic contemplation".
[8]
Pythagoras
changed the word to mean "the passionless contemplation of rational, unchanging truth" of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence.
[9]
Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word
theory
the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.
[10]
Aristotle's terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with
praxis
or practice, and this contrast exists till today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as
nature
, so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand,
praxis
involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of
praxis
or doing.

Formality
[
edit
]
Main article:
Theory (mathematical logic)
Theories are
analytical
tools for
understanding
,
explaining
, and making
predictions
about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the arts and sciences. A formal theory is
syntactic
in nature and is only meaningful when given a
semantic
component by applying it to some content (e.g.,
facts
and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are often expressed in
natural language
, but can be constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the
formal language
of
mathematical logic
. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of
rational thought
or
logic
.
[11]
Theory is constructed of a set of
sentences
that are thought to be true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as "He is a terrible person" cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some
interpretation
of who "He" is and for that matter what a "terrible person" is under the theory.
[12]
Sometimes two theories have exactly the same
explanatory power
because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or
observationally equivalent
, and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.
[

]
The
form of theories
is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in
model theory
. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are
closed
under application of certain procedures called
rules of inference
. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of
axioms
(or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A
theorem
is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are
abstractions
of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include
arithmetic
(abstracting concepts of number),
geometry
(concepts of space), and
probability
(concepts of randomness and likelihood).
Gödel's incompleteness theorem
shows that no consistent,
recursively enumerable
theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of
natural numbers
can be expressed, can include all
true
statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.
Underdetermination
[
edit
]
Main article:
Underdetermination
A theory is
underdetermined
(also called
indeterminacy of data to theory
) if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an
epistemological
issue about the relation of
evidence
to conclusions.
[
citation needed
]
A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a
hypothesis
.
[

Intertheoretic reduction and elimination
[
edit
]
Main article:
Intertheoretic reduction
If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more
explanatory power
), we are
justified
in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an
intertheoretic reduction
because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about
sound
,
light
and
heat
have been reduced to
wave compressions and rarefactions
,
electromagnetic waves
, and
molecular kinetic energy
, respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called
intertheoretic identities.
When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.
When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an
intertheoretic elimination.
For instance, the
obsolete scientific theory
that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of
caloric fluid
was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that
phlogiston
is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.
Versus theorems
[
edit
]
Theories are distinct from
theorems
. A
theorem
is
derived
deductively from
axioms
(basic assumptions) according to a
formal system
of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms.
Theories
are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are '
rigorously
tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.
The theory-practice gap
[
edit
]
Theory is often distinguished from practice. The question of whether theoretical models of work are relevant to work itself is of interest to scholars of professions such as medicine, engineering, law, and management.
[13]
: 802
This gap between theory and practice has been framed as a
knowledge transfer
where there is a task of translating research knowledge to be application in practice, and ensuring that practitioners are made aware of it. Academics have been criticized for not attempting to transfer the knowledge they produce to practitioners.
[13]
: 804
[14]
Another framing supposes that theory and knowledge seek to understand different problems and model the world in different words (using different
ontologies
and
epistemologies
). Another framing says that research does not produce theory that is relevant to practice.
[13]
: 803
In the context of management, Van de Van and Johnson propose a form of
engaged scholarship
where scholars examine problems that occur in practice, in an
interdisciplinary
fashion, producing results that create both new practical results as well as new theoretical models, but targeting theoretical results shared in an academic fashion.
[13]
: 815
They use a metaphor of "arbitrage" of ideas between disciplines, distinguishing it from collaboration.
[13]

Scientific
[
edit
]
Main article:
Scientific theory
In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been
repeatedly confirmed
through
observation
and experiment."
[15]
[16]
Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make
falsifiable
predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources (
consilience
).
The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make
falsifiable
predictions
with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing diseases.
Definitions from scientific organizations
[
edit
]
The
United States National Academy of Sciences
defines scientific theories as follows:
The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics) ... One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.
[17]
From the
American Association for the Advancement of Science
:
A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.
[16]
The term
theory
is not appropriate for describing
scientific models
or untested, but intricate hypotheses.
Philosophical views
[
edit
]
The
logical positivists
thought of scientific theories as
deductive theories
—that a theory's content is based on some
formal system
of logic and on basic
axioms
. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a
logical consequence
of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.
[12]
This is called the
received view of theories
.
In the
semantic view of theories
, which has largely replaced the received view,
[18]
[19]
theories are viewed as
scientific models
. A
model
is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See
Theories as models
for further discussion.)
In physics
[
edit
]
In
physics
the term
theory
is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic
postulates
(usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is
classical electromagnetism
, which encompasses results derived from
gauge symmetry
(sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called
Maxwell's equations
. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.
Regarding the term "theoretical"
[
edit
]
Certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not been confirmed or proven incorrect. These predictions may be described informally as "theoretical". They can be tested later, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.
[20]
Mathematical
[
edit
]
Main article:
Mathematical theory
In mathematics the use of the term
theory
is different, necessarily so, since mathematics contains no explanations of natural phenomena,
per se
, even though it may help provide insight into natural systems or be inspired by them. In the general sense, a mathematical
theory
is a branch of or topic in mathematics, such as
Set theory
,
Number theory
,
Group theory
,
Probability theory
,
Game theory
,
Control theory
,
Perturbation theory
, etc., such as might be appropriate for a single textbook.
In the same sense, but more specifically, the word
theory
is an extensive, structured collection of theorems, organized so that the proof of each theorem only requires the theorems and axioms that preceded it (no circular proofs), occurs as early as feasible in sequence (no postponed proofs), and the whole is as succinct as possible (no redundant proofs).
[d]
Ideally, the sequence in which the theorems are presented is as easy to understand as possible, although illuminating a branch of mathematics is the purpose of textbooks, rather than the mathematical theory they might be written to cover.
Philosophical
[
edit
]
Main article:
Philosophical theory
A theory can be either
descriptive
as in science, or
prescriptive
(
normative
) as in philosophy.
[21]
The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of
ideas
. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through
empirical observation
.
A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include
set theory
and
number theory
; however
literary theory
,
critical theory
, and
music theory
are also of the same form.
Metatheory
[
edit
]
Main article:
Metatheory
One form of philosophical theory is a
metatheory
or
meta-theory
. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories.
Statements
made in the metatheory about the theory are called
metatheorems
.
Political
[
edit
]
Main article:
Political theory
A political theory is an
ethical
theory about the law and government. Often the term "political theory" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, thought about politics.
Jurisprudential
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Jurisprudence
and
Law
In social science,
jurisprudence
is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.

arch dam
on the
Dajia River
in
Heping District
,
Taichung
,
Taiwan
. The dam serves for
hydroelectric power
generation and flood control, and is the third in a cascade of hydroelectric dams on the
Dajia River
, being located below the
Techi
and
Qingshan
dams and upstream from the
Tienlun Dam
. The dam supplies water to a power station consisting of four 45
megawatt
(MW) turbines for a total capacity of 180 MW, generating 507 million
kilowatt hours
per year.
[1]
The dam was built between 1957 and 1961 and stands 85.1 m (279 ft) high and 149 m (489 ft) long, holding up to 13,200,000 m
3
(10,700 acre⋅ft) of water.

Urban legend
v

The
Bermuda Triangle
, also known as the
Devil's Triangle
, is an
urban legend
focused on a loosely defined region in the western part of the North
Atlantic Ocean
where a number of
aircraft
and
ships
are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The idea of the area as uniquely prone to disappearances arose in the mid-20th century, but most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Origins
The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950, article published in
The Miami Herald
(
Associated Press
) by Edward Van Winkle Jones.
[4]
Two years later,
Fate
magazine published "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door",
[5]
[6]
a short article by George Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of
Flight 19
, a group of five
US Navy
Grumman TBM Avenger
torpedo bombers
on a training mission. Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place, as well as the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of
American Legion
magazine.
[7]
In it, author
Allan W. Eckert
wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, "We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no white." He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes "flew off to Mars."
[8]
In February 1964,
Vincent Gaddis
wrote an article called "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" in
Argosy
saying Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region.
[9]
[10]
The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book,
Invisible Horizons
.
[11]
Other writers elaborated on Gaddis' ideas: John Wallace Spencer (
Limbo of the Lost
, 1969, repr. 1973);
[12]
Charles Berlitz
(
The Bermuda Triangle
, 1974)
;
[13]
Richard Winer
(
The Devil's Triangle
, 1974),
[14]
and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.
[15]
Triangle area
The Gaddis
Argosy
article delineated the boundaries of the triangle,
[9]
giving its
vertices
as
Miami
;
San Juan
,
Puerto Rico
; and
Bermuda
. Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.
[16]
Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from 1,300,000 to 3,900,000 km
2
(500,000 to 1,510,000 sq mi).
[16]
"Indeed, some writers
[
who?
]
even stretch it as far as the
Irish coast
."
[2]
Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.
[16]
Criticism of the concept
Larry Kusche
Larry Kusche
, author of
The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved
(1975),
[1]
argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman
Donald Crowhurst
, which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an
Atlantic
port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the
Pacific
Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.
Kusche concluded that:
The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean.
In an area frequented by
tropical cyclones
, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious.
Furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this.
The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been.
Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937, off
Daytona Beach
, Florida, in front of hundreds of witnesses.
[17]
The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.
[1]
In a 2013 study, the
World Wide Fund for Nature
identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.
[18]
[19]
Further responses
When the
UK Channel 4
television program
The Bermuda Triangle
(1992)
[20]
was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the
Equinox
series, the marine insurance market
Lloyd's of London
was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.
[3]
Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area.
United States Coast Guard
records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.
[1]
The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker
V. A. Fogg
, the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies,
[21]
in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup.
[12]
In addition,
V. A. Fogg
sank off the coast of
Texas
, nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle.
The
Nova
/
Horizon
episode
The Case of the Bermuda Triangle
, aired on June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that "When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place ... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world."
[2]
Skeptical researchers
, such as Ernest Taves
[22]
and Barry Singer,
[23]
have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.
Benjamin Radford
, an author and scientific paranormal investigator, noted in an interview on the Bermuda Triangle that it could be very difficult locating an aircraft lost at sea due to the vast search area, and although the disappearance might be mysterious, that did not make it paranormal or unexplainable. Radford further noted the importance of double-checking information as the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle had been created by people who had neglected to do so.
[24]
Hypothetical explanation attempts
Persons accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches.
Paranormal explanations
Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of
Atlantis
. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the
Bimini Road
off the island of
Bimini
in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic
Edgar Cayce
take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968, as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, but the Bimini Road is of natural origin.
[25]
Some hypothesize that a parallel universe exists in the Bermuda Triangle region, causing a time/space warp that sucks the objects around it into a parallel universe.
[26]
Others attribute the events to
UFOs
.
[27]
[28]
Charles Berlitz
, author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.
[13]
Natural explanations
Compass variations
Compass
problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area,
[29]
such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural
magnetic variations
in relation to the
magnetic poles
, a fact which navigators have known for centuries.
Magnetic (compass) north
and
geographic (true) north
are exactly the same only for a small number of places - for example, as of 2000
, in the United States, only those places on a line running from
Wisconsin
to the
Gulf of Mexico
.
[30]
But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass "changing" across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.

False-color image of the Gulf Stream flowing north through the western Atlantic Ocean (NASA)
Gulf Stream
The
Gulf Stream
(
Florida Current
) is a major surface current, primarily driven by
thermohaline circulation
that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the
Straits of Florida
into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects.
[31]
It has a maximum surface velocity of about 2 m/s (6.6 ft/s).
[32]
A small plane making a
water landing
or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.
[33]
Human error
One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is
human error
.
[34]
Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht,
Revonoc
, as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January 1, 1958.
[35]
Violent weather
Hurricanes are powerful storms that form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of
Francisco de Bobadilla
's Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane.
[36]
These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle. Many Atlantic hurricanes pass through the Triangle as they recurve off the Eastern Seaboard, and, before the advent of
weather satellite
, ships often had little to no warning of a hurricane's approach.
[37]
Tracks of all Atlantic hurricanes between 1851 and 2019. Many storms pass through the Bermuda Triangle.
A powerful
downdraft of cold air
was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of
Pride of Baltimore
on May 14, 1986. The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from 32 km/h (20 mph) to 97-145 km/h (60-90 mph). A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist, James Lushine, stated "during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb, exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water."
[38]
Methane hydrates
Further information:
Methane clathrate
Worldwide distribution of confirmed or inferred offshore gas hydrate-bearing sediments, 1996.
Source:
United States Geological Survey
An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of
methane
hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the
continental shelves
.
[39]
Laboratory experiments carried out in Australia have proven that bubbles can, indeed, sink a scale model ship by decreasing the density of the water,
[40]
[41]
[42]
and any wreckage would be deposited on the ocean floor or rapidly dispersed by the Gulf Stream. It has been hypothesized that periodic methane
eruptions
(sometimes called "
mud volcanoes
") may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate
buoyancy
for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.
[43]
Publications by the
USGS
describe large stores of undersea hydrates worldwide, including the
Blake Ridge
area, off the coast of the southeastern United States.
[44]
However, according to the USGS, no large releases of gas hydrates are believed to have occurred in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 15,000 years.

The Graphic
1880
The sail training ship HMS
Atalanta
(originally named HMS
Juno
) disappeared with her entire crew after setting sail from the
Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda
for
Falmouth
,
England
on 31 January 1880.
[45]
It was presumed that she sank in a powerful
storm
which crossed her route a couple of weeks after she sailed, and that her crew being composed primarily of inexperienced trainees may have been a contributing factor. The search for evidence of her fate attracted worldwide attention at the time (connection is also often made to the 1878 loss of the training ship
HMS
Eurydice
, which foundered after departing the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda for Portsmouth on 6 March), and she was alleged decades later to have been a victim of the mysterious triangle, an allegation resoundingly refuted by the research of author
David Francis Raine
in 1997.

USS
Cyclops
Main article:
USS Cyclops (AC-4)
The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier
Cyclops
, carrying a full load of
manganese ore
and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 306 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of
Barbados
. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that
wartime enemy activity
was to blame for the loss.
[51]
[52]
In addition, two of
Cyclops
'
s sister ships,
Proteus
and
Nereus
, were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during
World War II
. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on
Cyclops
during her fatal voyage.
[53]
In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.

Fort Lauderdale
for 141 mi (227 km), north for 73 mi (117 km), and then back over a final 140 mi (225 km) leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance was attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel.
One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a
PBM Mariner
with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion
[55]
and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident.
[56]
According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapor leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.

Connemara IV
A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September 26, 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer)

passing nearby between 14 and 18 September, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force.
[1]
In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle, Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J.E. Challenor of Barbados:
[60]
On the morning of September 22,
Connemara IV
was lying to a heavy mooring in the open
roadstead
of
Carlisle Bay
. Because of the approaching hurricane, the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors. There was little else he could do, as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage. ... In Carlisle Bay, the sea in the wake of
Hurricane Janet
was awe-inspiring and dangerous. The owner of
Connemara IV
observed that she had disappeared. An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea.
KC-135 Stratotankers
On August 28, 1963, a pair of
US Air Force

aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic 300 miles (480 km) west of Bermuda.
[61]
[62]
Some writers
[9]
[13]
[14]
say that while the two aircraft did collide there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over 160 miles (260 km) of water. However, Kusche's research showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report revealed that the debris field defining the second "crash site" was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of
seaweed
and
driftwood
tangled in an old
buoy
.

Monument in Catania, Sicily
the Elefant Fountain view from the South with the
Palazzo degli Elefanti
in  the background
The
Elephant Fountain
(
Italian
:
Fontana dell'Elefante
) is a
monument
located in the center of
Piazza del Duomo
in the
Sicilian
city of
Catania
, designed by architect
Giovanni Battista Vaccarini
between 1735 and 1737. Its main element is a black
basalt
statue of an elephant, commonly called
u Liotru
, which has become the emblem of the city of Catania.
[1]
Structure
[
edit
]
Elephant Fountain view from the north
The Elephant Fountain was created by
Giovanni Battista Vaccarini
, an architect from
Palermo
, as part of the rebuilding of the city of Etna after the January 11, 1693 earthquake.  Most scholars believe that Vaccarini was inspired by
Gian Lorenzo Bernini
's
Elephant and Obelisk
, a similar structure in Rome's
Piazza della Minerva
.
[1]
However, other possibilities exist; an elephant surmounted by an obelisk with a ball on top is documented in the
Hypnerotomachia Poliphili
, page 38, (Venice, 1499) attributed to
Francesco Colonna
.
[2]
The
plinth
consists of a
white marble
pedestal located in the center of a basin, also made of marble, into which jets of water fall and spout from the plinth. On the plinth two sculptures reproduce the two rivers of Catania, the
Simeto
and the Amenano. Above is the statue of the elephant, its
proboscis
facing the cathedral of
St. Agatha
, patron saint of Catania.
[1]
On the animal's back is an Egyptian-style
obelisk
,
[3]
3.66 meters high, made of granite, hypothetically from
Syene
; it has no
hieroglyphics
, but is decorated with Egyptian-style figures that do not constitute meaningful hieroglyphic writing. Of uncertain chronology, it may have been one of the two destinations of Catania's ancient
Roman circus
; the other, more fragmentary one is in the courtyard of the Ursino Castle. Mounted on the top part of the obelisk are a
globe
, surrounded by a crown of a
palm leaf
(representing martyrdom) and a branch of lilies (representing purity), plus above it a
metal
tablet on which there is an inscription dedicated to St. Agatha with the acronym "MSSHDEPL" ("Sound and sincere mind, for the honor of God and the liberation of her homeland"), and finally a cross.
[4]
History
[
edit
]
The inscription on the top of the obelisk
The Elephant Statue
Until 1737 Vaccarini worked to build the fountain, which was later completed with the Egyptian obelisk and the Agatine inscription. In 1757 it was renovated for the first time to add a basin. In 1826 the fountain was circumscribed by an iron fence, within which a small garden was made. Shortly after the
unification of Italy
, a decision was made to move the fountain from Piazza del Duomo to Piazza Palestro: on May 30, 1862, however, Bonaventura Gravina organized a popular uprising that blocked the move.
There were two restorations carried out during the 20th century: in 1905 a second pool was built, and in 1998 the gate and garden were removed so that today it is possible to sit on some steps at the foot of the base.
[5]
U
Liotru
[
edit
]
The fountain
The myth
[
edit
]
U Liotru (also called, more rarely, Diotru) owes its appellation to the mispronunciation of the name
Heliodorus
. The latter, according to popular legends, was a nobleman from Catania who allegedly tried unsuccessfully to become
bishop
of the
diocese
. Having fallen from grace, he is said to have become an apostate and to have been considered a "
disciple of the Jews, a
necromancer
and a smith of idols.
[6]
" He would oppose Bishop Leo II the Thaumaturge, who would then condemn him to be burned alive in the Forum Achelles. This phantom character was linked to the elephant because a
legend
said that he was its sculptor and even used to ride it
[7]
to travel from Catania to
Constantinople
. Also according to the legend, Bishop Leo allegedly had the statue taken outside the walls so that it would be forgotten, but the people would still give it divine honors. However, all the adventures of such Heliodorus and related connection with the stone elephant are to be considered mere invention.
Contrary to the fanciful versions of not only popular vulgate, the statue of the elephant symbolizing the City of Catania is the gnomon of the sundial placed in the center of Piazza Duomo. The monument is a measurer of time by sunlight and is therefore "heliotric," which in the Catania dialect has become "liotru." After the 1693 earthquake, the reconstruction of Catania coincided with the period of greatest diffusion of sundials in Sicily and other parts of southern Italy. Carlo Maria Carafa, prince of Butera, is considered the most illustrious "gnomonist," that is, an expert in the construction of illustrious sundials, of that period. It is not possible that he participated in the construction of the Catanese sundial in Piazza Duomo. According to the late 18th-century traveler Jean Houel, "the obelisk is Egyptian; it is made of granite and covered with hieroglyphics. According to a widespread notion in Catania, it was placed in a public square so that it would serve as a stylus, or gnomon, to tell the time by its shadow cast on a dial drawn on the ground.
[8]
"
The origin
[
edit
]
There is no certain data on when and by whom the elephant statue was made. Over the centuries, various scholars have tried to answer this question, in some cases even drawing on myth. The latter include
Pietro Carrera
, who wrote in 1639 that the liotru commemorated a victory in a war between the Catanese and the
Libyans
.
[9]
However, the story, which the painter
Giuseppe Sciuti
immortalized in the great historical curtain of the
Teatro Massimo Bellini
, is totally fictional.
More likely are the theories conceived by Ignatius II Paternò Castello,
[10]
Santi Consoli,
[11]
and Matteo Gaudioso.
[12]
The former claimed that the elephant came from a
circus
(it would later be ascertained that it was actually the obelisk that had been among the attractions of an ancient circus), the latter two that it was a reminder of a religion whose traces are now completely lost.
However, the current accepted interpretation was given by the
geographer
Idrisi
during his trip to Sicily in the
12th century
. He reported that the Catanese considered the elephant to be a magical statue, capable of protecting the town from the
eruptions
of Mount
Etna
.
[13]
Also according to the Arab geographer, the statue was built during
Carthaginian
rule.
According to the geographer Idrisi, the elephant statue was made during Carthaginian or
Byzantine
rule. By the time he visited Catania (
12th century
), the lava stone elephant was already inside the city walls.
[14]
It was reportedly brought there by the
Benedictines
of the
monastery
of
St. Agatha
, who placed it under an
arch
known as "di Liodoro.
[15]
" In 1239 the elephant statue was chosen as the symbol of Catania. Some claim that the transfer within the walls took place on this very occasion.
The elephant's relationship with the city
[
edit
]
The connection between Catania and the liotru is very ancient. An ancient
legend
tells of an elephant that allegedly hunted ferocious animals during the founding of Kατάvη.
[16]
Under
Muslim rule
, the city was known as Balad-el-fil or Medinat-el-fil, meaning "city of the elephant."
The Liotru did not become an official symbol of the city until 1239: before then, the city emblem was the
effigy
of
St. George
. The Catanese decided to change following a series of uprisings in order to move from being merely the domain of a bishop-
count
to a state-owned city. After failing in the uprisings of 1195, 1207 and 1221, success came with the official concession signed by
Frederick II
. The first "official release" of the new symbol occurred at a session of
Parliament
in
Foggia
in 1240.

Marina Bay
is a
bay
located in the
Central Area
of
Singapore
, surrounded by the perimeter of four other planning areas, the
Downtown Core
,
Marina East
,
Marina South
and
Straits View
. The area surrounding the bay itself, also called Marina Bay, is a 360 hectare extension to the adjacent
Central Business District
. It is also the new downtown of
Singapore
, built on reclaimed land.
[1]
Buildings include
Gardens by the Bay
, the
Marina Bay Sands
,
Marina Bay Financial Centre
,
Asia Square
,
The Sail @ Marina Bay
and Marina One integrated mixed-use developments. It is one of the key focus areas by the
Urban Redevelopment Authority
. Marina Bay is envisioned by the URA as a work-live-play vibrant 24-hour CBD.
Master Plan
[
edit
]
The
Urban Redevelopment Authority
(URA) Master Plan for Marina Bay aims to encourage a mix of uses for this area, including commercial, residential, hotel and entertainment.
History
[
edit
]
Marina Bay at night
In 1969, land reclamation work to create 360 hectares of prime waterfront site began at Marina Bay. The
reclaimed land
forms what is today the
Marina Centre
and
Marina South
areas, and the reclamation work was completed in 1992.
[2]
[3]
[4]
In the reclamation process,  Inner/Outer Basins (anchorage area for commercial and naval vessels), Telok Ayer Basin (now site of Asia Square Tower 1 and 2) and Inner Roads was removed from the map by reclaiming land, while the
Singapore River
's mouth now flows into the bay instead of directly into the sea.
The long term visions for the Marina Bay area were first articulated in the 1983 Master Plan by the
Urban Redevelopment Authority
(URA), with the waterfront areas being deliberately kept open to the public.
[2]
In 1988, the draft plan for Marina Bay was presented to the public in a two-week exhibition where it set out the objectives for the development, among which are optimising the waterfront location and creating a distinctive image with international landmarks that could become a focal point for the city.
[5]
The URA Master Plan for Marina Bay aims to encourage a mix of uses for this area, including commercial, residential, hotel and entertainment and to turn it into a work-live-play vibrant 24-hour CBD. In 2005, the Urban Redevelopment Authority spent $400,000 on a branding exercise to name the Marina Bay area in order to sell the new major developments in the area, only to settle with the original name "Marina Bay".
[6]
[7]
The Singapore government also spent $35 million to complete the 3.5 km Waterfront Promenade around Marina Bay.
[8]
It includes a new eco-friendly visitor centre and the
Helix Bridge
linking Bayfront to Marina Centre where the
Youth Olympic Park
is located. The Promontory @ Marina Bay (formerly Central Promontory Site) will be used as an interim event and public space used for activities such as theatres and carnivals.
[9]
In 2008,
Marina Barrage
was built, converting the basin into a freshwater Marina Reservoir.
Events at Marina Bay
[
edit
]
Marina Bay viewed from the Singapore Flyer at sunset
The
Formula One
Singapore Grand Prix
has taken place annually since 2008 (with the exception of the
2020
and
2021
seasons) on a
street circuit
adjacent to Marina Bay.
[10]
Since its construction in 2007,
The Float@Marina Bay
has hosted events such as the
National Day Parade
, New Year's Eve Countdown
[11]
and
Singapore Fireworks Celebrations
, and also serves as a spectator stand for the Singapore Grand Prix. Furthermore, it also played host to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the inaugural
2010 Summer Youth Olympics
.
[12]
The area also hosts the annual
i Light Marina Bay
, a sustainable light art festival.
The event space next to Marina Bay Sands, known as The Lawn, hosted the first overseas and Singapore edition of ArtBox Bangkok on two separate weekends, 14-16 April and 21-23 April 2017.

Infrastructure
[
edit
]
The Singapore government pumped nearly S$2 billion (about US$1.2 billion) to build the infrastructural base for Marina Bay, which includes the
Marina Barrage
, increased connectivity to the
MRT
, and the new
Marina Promenade
and
Helix Bridge
.

Common Services Tunnel
[
edit
]
The Common Services Tunnel is a development of the Marina Bay area in Singapore. It is said to be the second of its kind in Asia after
Japan
. This
utility tunnel
houses telecom cables, power lines, water pipes as well as provision for pneumatic refuse collection pipes.
[15]
The 1.4-kilometre (4,600 ft) phase one of the tunnel has cost about
S$
81 million (about
US$
51 million) while 1.6-kilometre (5,200 ft) phase two, cost around S$137 million (about US$86 million).
District cooling
[
edit
]
SP Group
's subsidiary, Singapore District Cooling, started operating Singapore’s first
district cooling
plant, supplying chilled water supplies to
One Raffles Quay
in May 2006.
[16]
A second district cooling plant was commissioned in May 2010,
[16]
which will supply chilled water for the air-conditioning of buildings in the area through pipes housed within the Common Services Tunnel, according to the report. Built at a cost of some S$110 million (about US$69 million), the second district cooling plant will be able to serve 1.25 million square metres of gross floor area and free up space which should be used for building chiller plants and cooling towers for separate buildings. The second district cooling plant started operations on 3 March 2016.
[17]
Water management
[
edit
]
In 2004, the
Public Utilities Board
announced plans to construct a new downtown reservoir by damming the
Marina Channel
. This barrage was completed in 2008. Known as the
Marina Barrage
, it turned Marina Bay and the
Kallang Basin
into a confined freshwater reservoir with limited access to marine transportation to regulate the water quality. The new reservoir provides another source of drinking water for Singapore, as well as a stable water level for a variety of water activities and events. The barrage also prevents flooding in the
Chinatown
area.
Transport
[
edit
]
There are currently eight rail stations:
City Hall
,
Raffles Place
,
Marina Bay
,
Bayfront
,
Downtown
,
Telok Ayer
,
Esplanade
and
Promenade
serving Marina Bay. As the plan set out, by 2020, the 360 hectares of Marina Bay boasts a comprehensive transport network as Singapore's most rail-connected district.
[18]
The first three new MRT lines (
Circle line
,
Downtown line
) opened between 2012 and 2013. By 2018, the Marina Bay district had more than six
MRT
stations, all no more than five minutes of each other. The
Thomson-East Coast MRT line
created better connections within Marina South, opened in 2022. A
pedestrian
network links developments and
MRT
stations.
[19]
Within greater Marina Bay, water taxis will even double up as an alternative mode of transport.
